## Proposed EC/Sub-subclass  
2.7.11.24  

## Accepted name  
Mitogen-activated protein kinase 14  

## Synonyms  
p38 α; p38 MAPK; MAP kinase 14  

## 1. Phylogeny  
Member of the p38 subfamily of stress-activated protein kinases, which comprises p38 α (MAPK14), β, γ and δ. These isoforms are conserved throughout vertebrate evolution and share ancestry with the yeast stress-responsive kinase HOG1. MAPK14 shows ~50 % sequence identity with ERK2 and resides in the CMGC group of Ser/Thr kinases. Phylogenetic analyses based on the dual-phosphorylation motif and docking regions place MAPK14 on a distinct, ancient branch that has retained key functional residues over hundreds of millions of years (PMID: 21372320, 10881912, 9922379, 9560430).  

## 2. Reaction catalyzed  
ATP + L-seryl/threonyl-[protein] ⇌ ADP + H⁺ + O-phospho-L-seryl/threonyl-[protein] (PMID: 9922379, 21372320).  

## 3. Cofactor requirements  
Mg²⁺ is essential for ATP coordination and catalysis (PMID: 12057199).  

## 4. Substrate specificity  
Selectively phosphorylates Ser/Thr residues followed by Pro (S/T-P motif). Docking interactions further refine recognition, enabling phosphorylation of an estimated 200-300 substrates that include transcription factors (ATF1, ATF2, MEF2, Elk-1, TP53) and downstream kinases (MK2, MK3, MNK1, MNK2) (PMID: 21372320, 10881912).  

## 5. Structure  
Consists solely of the canonical protein-kinase bilobed catalytic domain: a β-sheet-rich N-lobe and an α-helical C-lobe. The activation loop harbours the conserved Thr-Gly-Tyr (TGY) motif; dual phosphorylation here triggers the conformational change required for full activity. Crystal structures reveal a defined ATP-binding cleft, a hydrophobic spine and C-helix residues that participate in substrate binding; subtle differences in docking sites distinguish p38 α from its paralogues (PMID: 21372320, 9922379).  

## 6. Regulation  
Activated by dual phosphorylation of Thr183 and Tyr185 by MKK3 and MKK6 in response to UV, oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines. Upon activation, MAPK14 translocates between cytoplasm and nucleus. Dephosphorylated and inactivated by MAP kinase phosphatases (MKPs). Interactions with other regulators, such as casein kinase II, modulate autophosphorylation and overall activity (PMID: 21372320, 10881912, 15187184, 12057199).  

## 7. Function  
Key mediator of stress and inflammatory signalling. Through phosphorylation of transcription factors, downstream kinases and chromatin-associated proteins, MAPK14 controls immediate-early gene expression, chromatin remodelling, cell-cycle checkpoints, protein turnover and receptor endocytosis (PMID: 21372320, 9922379).  

## 8. Other comments  
Widely used ATP-competitive inhibitors include SB203580 and SB202190; these compounds block MAPK14 activity in cells and are tools for dissecting p38 signalling. Dysregulated MAPK14 activity is linked to inflammatory diseases, certain cancers and developmental disorders, making the kinase an ongoing therapeutic target (PMID: 10881912, 9649428, 15187184, 21372320).
