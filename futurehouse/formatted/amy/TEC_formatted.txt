## Phylogeny  
TEC (UniProt P42680) belongs to the Tec family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases (BTK, ITK, TEC, TXK/RLK, BMX). The family forms an evolutionarily ancient clade, distinct from Src- or Abl-related groups, with origins predating metazoans (Ortutay et al., 2008; Smith et al., 2001). Orthologues are found across vertebrates, and the major paralogues diversified early in animal evolution, highlighting their conserved signalling role, especially in haematopoietic lineages (Miller & Berg, 2002).

## Reaction Catalyzed  
ATP + protein-L-tyrosine → ADP + protein-L-phosphotyrosine + H⁺ (Nore et al., 2003; Miller & Berg, 2002).

## Cofactor Requirements  
Requires divalent Mg²⁺ for ATP binding and catalysis, as is typical for protein kinases (Amatya et al., 2019; Nore et al., 2003).

## Substrate Specificity  
TEC phosphorylates tyrosine residues within signalling proteins engaged in immune-receptor pathways. Docking involves its SH2/SH3 domains and favours substrates with proline-rich regions and/or phosphotyrosine motifs (Joseph et al., 2010; Nore et al., 2003). Documented substrates include DOK1, CD28-associated proteins, STAP1, GRB10, and FGF2 (Amatya et al., 2019; Bradshaw, 2010).

## Structure  
Modular domain order: PH–TH–SH3–SH2–kinase.  
• PH domain binds PIP₃ and participates in autoinhibition (Amatya et al., 2019).  
• TH domain contains a zinc-binding Btk motif and proline-rich segment (Smith et al., 2001).  
• SH3 and SH2 mediate poly-proline and phosphotyrosine interactions, respectively (Smith et al., 2001; Brazin et al., 2000).  
• Kinase (SH1) domain exhibits the classical bilobal fold with a regulated activation loop, C-helix, and hydrophobic spine (Bradshaw, 2010; Ortutay et al., 2008).  
Dynamic inter-domain contacts underpin switching between inactive and active states.

## Regulation  
1. Autoinhibition: N-terminal PH domain occludes the kinase active site; binding to PIP₃ relieves this block and recruits TEC to membranes (Amatya et al., 2019).  
2. Phosphorylation:  
   – Activation-loop tyrosine phosphorylation (by Src family kinases or auto-phosphorylation) is essential for full activity (Joseph et al., 2010; Miller & Berg, 2002).  
   – SH3 domain phosphorylation modulates intramolecular interactions (Nore et al., 2003).  
3. Allosteric shifts in the C-helix and regulatory spine further fine-tune catalysis (Bradshaw, 2010; Joseph et al., 2010).

## Function  
Widely expressed in immune and selected non-immune cells, TEC integrates signals downstream of multiple receptors.  
• T lymphocytes: Functions redundantly with ITK in TCR and CD28 pathways, driving IL-2 production and NKT-cell development (Amatya et al., 2019).  
• B lymphocytes: Cooperates with BTK in BCR signalling via STAP1 phosphorylation (Miller & Berg, 2002).  
• Mast cells & myeloid cells: Supports cytokine production and CSF3-mediated signalling (Miller & Berg, 2002; Mihara & Suzuki, 2007).  
• Platelets: Acts downstream of integrins and GPCRs in haemostatic responses (Bradshaw, 2010).  
• Hepatocytes & bone cells: Contributes to HGF-induced ERK activation, liver regeneration, FGF2 unconventional secretion (Tyr-215), and osteoclast differentiation (Amatya et al., 2019).

## Inhibitors  
No TEC-selective inhibitors are established. Clinical success of BTK inhibitors illustrates the tractability of Tec-family active sites and highlights TEC as a potential therapeutic target (Bradshaw, 2010).

## Other Comments  
Functional redundancy with ITK (T cells) and BTK (B cells) suggests that modulation of TEC activity could broadly impact immune responses. Dysregulation of Tec-family kinases is associated with immunodeficiency and inflammatory disorders, motivating further studies on TEC substrates, regulation, and selective inhibition (Smith et al., 2001; Miller & Berg, 2002).
