## Phylogeny  
Serine/threonine-protein kinase H1 (PSKH1; UniProt P11801) is an active member of the eukaryotic protein kinase superfamily and clusters within the Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent kinase (CAMK) branch (Brede et al., 2000; Manning & Hunter, 2010). The catalytic domain shares ~50 % identity with rat CaMKI, defining a distinct sub-family of serine/threonine kinases (Brede et al., 2000). PSKH1 is conserved in many vertebrates but is absent from the mouse kinome, indicating a rodent-specific gene loss (Caenepeel et al., 2004). It is clearly distinct from its paralog, the pseudokinase PSKH2 (Shrestha et al., 2020).  

## Reaction Catalyzed  
ATP + L-seryl/threonyl-[protein] ⇌ ADP + H⁺ + O-phospho-L-seryl/threonyl-[protein] (Anti, 2009).  

## Cofactor Requirements  
Mg²⁺ is required for catalysis (Anti, 2009).  

## Substrate Specificity  
PSKH1 preferentially phosphorylates non-snRNP splicing factors that contain serine/arginine-rich (SR) domains; a strict consensus motif has not been defined (Berson et al., 1999; Shrestha et al., 2020).  

## Structure  
The protein is ~305 amino acids. An N-terminal segment (residues 1–19) contains a myristoylation site at Gly2 and palmitoylation sites at Cys6 and Cys8, flanked by basic residues resembling SH4 membrane-targeting domains (Berson et al., 1999). The catalytic domain (≈ residues 20–294) exhibits the 12 conserved kinase subdomains; key residues include Lys49 (ATP binding), His146, and the APE motif starting at Ala200, forming a canonical bilobed kinase fold with minimal predicted disorder (Berson et al., 1999).  

## Regulation  
Activity is modulated by dual fatty acylation: myristoylation at Gly2 is required for subsequent palmitoylation at Cys6/Cys8, directing the kinase to membrane compartments (Berson et al., 1999). PSKH1 autophosphorylates on threonine residues and phosphorylates exogenous substrates such as PHAS-I (Berson et al., 1999). Although it lacks a classical calmodulin-binding domain, an N-terminal stretch resembles a CaMKI motif (Brede et al., 2000; Shrestha et al., 2020). Overall regulation integrates lipid-mediated localization with phosphorylation-dependent control.  

## Function  
PSKH1 is implicated in pre-mRNA processing by phosphorylating SR proteins within nuclear splice factor compartments; this reversible modification alters their intranuclear distribution and influences alternative splicing (Berson et al., 1999). Cellular studies localize PSKH1 to the Golgi apparatus, centrosomes, and nucleus, consistent with its lipidation-dependent membrane targeting (Brede et al., 2000; Shrestha et al., 2020).  

## Inhibitors  
No selective inhibitors have been described; inhibitors developed against related serine/threonine kinases may serve as starting points for functional studies (Berson et al., 1999; Shrestha et al., 2020).  

## Other Comments  
PSKH1 is classified under EC 2.7.11.1 and has been referred to as “protein serine kinase H1.” Its absence from the mouse genome highlights a notable lineage-specific gene loss (Caenepeel et al., 2004). Although not yet linked to specific diseases, its role in alternative splicing suggests potential relevance where splicing is dysregulated (Berson et al., 1999; Shrestha et al., 2020).
