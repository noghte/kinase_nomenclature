## Proposed EC/sub-subclass  
2.7.11.22  

## Accepted name  
Cyclin-dependent kinase 6  

## Synonyms  
CDK6; member of the CDK4/6 sub-family; forms Cyclin D–CDK6 holoenzymes.  

## Phylogeny  
CDK6 is one of the serine/threonine protein kinases that expanded from a single ancestral CDK in lower eukaryotes to multiple specialised members in metazoans.  It is confined to eumetazoans, groups with CDK4 in a distinct CDK4/6 clade of the CMGC kinase group, and has orthologues in all mammalian species (Asghar et al., 2015; Fassl et al., 2022; Malumbres & Barbacid, 2005; Malumbres, 2014).  

## Reaction catalysed  
ATP + L-seryl/threonyl-[protein] ⇄ ADP + H⁺ + O-phospho-L-seryl/threonyl-[protein] (Huwe et al., 2003).  

## Cofactor requirements  
Mg²⁺ is essential for ATP binding and catalysis (Huwe et al., 2003).  

## Substrate Specificity  
When complexed with D-type cyclins, CDK6 preferentially phosphorylates Ser/Thr residues followed by Pro (S/T-P sites).  Its best-characterised substrates include retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and nucleophosmin (NPM1).  Cyclin partner choice further modulates substrate affinity and context (Asghar et al., 2015; Huwe et al., 2003; Fassl et al., 2022; Malumbres, 2014).  

## Structure  
CDK6 adopts the canonical bilobal kinase fold: an N-terminal β-sheet lobe containing the glycine-rich loop and a predominantly α-helical C-terminal lobe that houses the catalytic residues.  Key features include a conserved ATP-binding pocket, an activation loop subject to regulatory phosphorylation and a C-helix whose orientation is cyclin-dependent.  Cyclin D binding stabilises the active conformation.  Compared with CDK4, CDK6 shows distinct surface features that influence inhibitor binding and interaction with regulators such as p16^INK4A (Ferrer et al., 2006; Wood & Endicott, 2018; Fassl et al., 2022).  

## Regulation  
• Activation requires association with D-type cyclins induced by mitogenic signals (Asghar et al., 2015; Fassl et al., 2022).  
• Phosphorylation of the activation loop by CDK-activating kinases (e.g., CDK7–cyclin H) augments activity (Malumbres, 2014; Lolli & Johnson, 2005).  
• INK4 family inhibitors (p16^INK4A and relatives) prevent cyclin binding and distort the ATP pocket (Sausville, 2002; Sielecki et al., 2000).  
• Cip/Kip proteins (p21^Cip1, p27^Kip1) can inhibit or scaffold cyclin D–CDK6 complexes depending on their phosphorylation state (Fassl et al., 2022; Peyressatre et al., 2015).  

## Function  
Principal driver of G1-phase progression: phosphorylation of Rb releases E2F transcription factors and triggers S-phase gene expression (Asghar et al., 2015; Suryadinata et al., 2010).  
Tissue-specific roles include proliferation of haematopoietic cells, erythroid progenitors, pancreatic β-cells, thymocytes, and neuronal progenitors (Sherr et al., 2016; Malumbres, 2011).  CDK6 also modulates differentiation programmes and transcription factors such as RUNX1 and influences cytoskeletal dynamics in astrocytes (Malumbres, 2014).  A cyclin D3–CDK6 complex has additional metabolic functions that promote cancer cell survival (Wang et al., 2017).  

## Inhibitors  
Clinically approved ATP-competitive inhibitors targeting CDK6 include palbociclib, ribociclib and abemaciclib; they block Rb phosphorylation and arrest cells in G1 (Sherr et al., 2016; Peyressatre et al., 2015).  Numerous additional small-molecule inhibitors have been reported (Huwe et al., 2003; Knockaert et al., 2002; Tadesse et al., 2018).  

## Other Comments  
CDK6 is frequently overexpressed or hyperactivated in cancer, making it a prime therapeutic target.  Unique structural elements relative to other CDKs provide avenues for highly selective inhibitor development (Wood & Endicott, 2018; Ferrer et al., 2006).  Beyond proliferation, CDK6 participates in centrosome organisation and senescence control (Malumbres, 2014; Suryadinata et al., 2010).
