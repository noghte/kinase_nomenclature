## Phylogeny  
MAPK3 (ERK1) is a member of the CMGC group of protein kinases and one of two closely related conventional ERK isoforms (ERK1/ERK2 share ≈83 % amino-acid identity). Orthologues are detected from yeast to vertebrates, underscoring an ancient, highly conserved signalling module that arose early in eukaryotic evolution and was later duplicated to yield the ERK1 and ERK2 genes now present in mammals (Cargnello & Roux, 2011; Keshet & Seger, 2010; Li et al., 2011; Krishna & Narang, 2008).

## Reaction Catalyzed  
ATP + L-seryl/threonyl-[protein] ⇌ ADP + H⁺ + O-phospho-L-seryl/threonyl-[protein] (Pearson et al., 2001; Cargnello & Roux, 2011).

## Cofactor Requirements  
Mg²⁺ is required for ATP binding and catalysis (Cargnello & Roux, 2011; Pearson et al., 2001).

## Substrate Specificity  
ERK1 is a proline-directed Ser/Thr kinase that preferentially phosphorylates motifs containing Ser/Thr followed immediately by Pro (p[ST]P). A conserved docking groove further guides recognition of numerous substrates, including transcription factors ELK1, ATF2 and other regulators of cytoskeletal dynamics (Cargnello & Roux, 2011; Guo et al., 2020; Pearson et al., 2001; Krishna & Narang, 2008).

## Structure  
The enzyme adopts the canonical bilobed protein-kinase fold: an N-terminal β-sheet-rich lobe with a glycine-rich loop that coordinates ATP, and a predominantly helical C-terminal lobe that houses the substrate-binding site. The activation loop bears a Thr-Glu-Tyr (TEY) motif whose dual phosphorylation is essential for full activity. Common docking (CD) sites on the kinase surface mediate interactions with upstream MEK1/2, substrates and scaffold proteins. Crystal structures and AlphaFold models show that activation-loop phosphorylation repositions catalytic residues and completes the substrate-binding cleft (Cargnello & Roux, 2011; Keshet & Seger, 2010; Lavoie et al., 2020; Kirsch, 2021).

## Regulation  
• Activation: Dual phosphorylation of the TEY motif by MEK1/2 induces the active conformation (Cargnello & Roux, 2011; Kyriakis & Avruch, 2012).  
• Spatial control: Scaffold proteins (e.g., KSR) tether ERK1 to its activators and substrates, enhancing signal fidelity (Lavoie et al., 2020; Keshet & Seger, 2010).  
• Inactivation: Dual-specificity phosphatases (e.g., DUSP6) dephosphorylate the activation loop and terminate signalling (Theodosiou & Ashworth, 2002; Raman et al., 2007).  
• Feedback and additional modulators fine-tune amplitude and duration of kinase activity (Guo et al., 2020; Kirsch, 2021).

## Function  
Upon activation, ERK1 translocates to the nucleus and phosphorylates transcription factors (ELK1, ATF2, FOS), regulating gene programmes that drive cell growth, differentiation and survival. Cytosolic substrates control translation, cytoskeletal reorganisation and endosomal trafficking. ERK1 participates in receptor tyrosine kinase pathways (e.g., EGF, PDGF, KIT ligand) and is involved in cell-cycle control during mitosis and meiosis. High expression levels are noted in brain, skeletal muscle, thymus and heart (Cargnello & Roux, 2011; Guo et al., 2020; Lavoie et al., 2020; Lai, 2015).

## Inhibitors  
Multiple small-molecule agents inhibit the MAPK/ERK pathway by targeting MEK or ERK directly; several are in clinical evaluation for cancers with hyperactive ERK signalling (Samadani et al., 2015; Roberts & Der, 2007).

## Other Comments  
ERK1 phosphorylates >160 identified substrates, underscoring its role as a central signalling hub. Dysregulated ERK activity contributes to oncogenesis, developmental disorders and other pathologies, making MAPK3 an attractive therapeutic target (Cargnello & Roux, 2011; Guo et al., 2020).
