## Phylogeny  
MAPK10 (c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3; JNK3) is a stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase that descended from the ancestral serine/threonine kinase repertoire present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor. Subsequent gene duplications produced the three mammalian JNK paralogues; while JNK1 and JNK2 are ubiquitously expressed, JNK3 expression is largely confined to neurons and, to a lesser extent, heart and testes (Kyriakis & Avruch, 2012; Ansideri, 2018). Sequence conservation is high within the catalytic core, whereas peripheral regions have diverged to mediate isoform-specific protein interactions.

## Reaction Catalyzed  
ATP + protein-L-Ser/Thr ⇌ ADP + protein-L-Ser/Thr-phosphate + H⁺  
(Bardwell, 2006)

## Cofactor Requirements  
Mg²⁺ is essential for ATP coordination and phosphotransfer (Bardwell, 2006).

## Substrate Specificity  
JNK3 phosphorylates serine/threonine residues followed by proline (S/T-P) but achieves high selectivity through short basic-hydrophobic “D-site” docking motifs on its substrates (Whisenant et al., 2010; Gordon et al., 2013). Canonical neuronal targets include the transcription factors c-Jun and ATF2 as well as STMN2, amyloid-β precursor protein (APP), and additional proteins enriched in the central nervous system (Ansideri, 2018; Kyriakis & Avruch, 2012).

## Structure  
The kinase adopts the conserved bilobed MAPK fold: a β-sheet-rich N-lobe with a glycine-rich loop and αC-helix abuts an α-helical C-lobe. Activation depends on dual phosphorylation of Thr183 and Tyr185 within the TxY motif of the activation loop by MAP2K4/7 (Lu et al., 2023; Messoussi et al., 2016). High-resolution crystal structures and AlphaFold models reveal substrate-binding grooves on the ordered catalytic core, whereas the C-terminal tail contains intrinsically disordered regions that provide flexible interfaces for scaffolds and substrates (Giới, 2022; Whisenant et al., 2010).

## Regulation  
• Activation: dual phosphorylation of the TxY motif by MAP2K4 and MAP2K7.  
• Docking control: substrate D-sites increase local concentration and catalytic efficiency (Gordon et al., 2013).  
• Scaffolds: neuronal JIP1 and β-arrestin2 organize JNK3 signalling complexes and direct localisation (Musi et al., 2022).  
• Inhibition: protein–protein interaction with MEN1 can reduce phosphorylation of specific substrates such as JUND (Kyriakis & Avruch, 2012).

## Function  
Predominantly neuronal, JNK3 links extracellular stress (e.g., pro-inflammatory cytokines, physical insults) to transcriptional and structural responses. Phosphorylation of c-Jun, ATF2 and other AP-1 components modulates gene programmes governing neuronal differentiation, migration and apoptosis (Kyriakis & Avruch, 2012; Musi et al., 2022). Additional substrates extend its influence to neurite outgrowth (STMN2), APP-mediated signalling during differentiation, and circadian regulation via CLOCK–BMAL1 (Ansideri, 2018; Lu et al., 2023).

## Inhibitors  
Structure-guided campaigns have produced ATP-competitive and covalent inhibitors that preferentially inhibit JNK2/3 over JNK1 by exploiting subtle active-site differences (Lu et al., 2023; Messoussi et al., 2016). Virtual-screening studies propose additional chemotypes targeting promiscuous binding pockets (Sailapathi et al., 2020). Disruption of scaffold interactions (e.g., JIP1 or β-arrestin2 binding surfaces) is also being explored as an alternative inhibitory strategy (Ansideri, 2018).

## Other Comments  
JNK3 is under active investigation as a therapeutic target in neurodegenerative disorders, where aberrant stress-induced apoptosis contributes to neuronal loss. Computational tools such as the D-finder algorithm continue to expand the catalogue of JNK3 substrates and docking motifs, enriching our understanding of its signalling network (Whisenant et al., 2010; Gordon et al., 2013).
