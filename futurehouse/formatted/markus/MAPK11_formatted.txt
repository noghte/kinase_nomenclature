## Phylogeny  
MAPK11 (p38 β) is an evolutionarily conserved member of the p38 MAPK subfamily. Across vertebrates it is consistently found in a gene cluster that also encodes the closely related MAPK14 (p38 α) and the more divergent p38 γ and p38 δ isoforms, reflecting a segmental duplication event that split the p38 lineage into two branches, one of which includes MAPK11 and MAPK14 (Li, Liu, & Zhang, 2011; Escós, Risco, Alsina-Beauchamp, & Cuenda, 2016; Roux & Blenis, 2004). Conservation of MAPK11 in multiple species underscores its role as part of an evolutionary core set of stress-responsive kinases (Li et al., 2011).  

## Reaction Catalyzed  
ATP + L-seryl/threonyl-[protein] ⇌ ADP + H⁺ + O-phospho-L-seryl/threonyl-[protein] (Cargnello & Roux, 2011; Shi & Gaestel, 2002).  

## Cofactor Requirements  
Catalysis requires Mg²⁺ to coordinate ATP at the active site (Machado, Machado, & Pascutti, 2021; Shi & Gaestel, 2002).  

## Substrate Specificity  
MAPK11 is a Ser/Thr kinase that preferentially phosphorylates substrates containing a Ser/Thr-Pro motif. Its relatively relaxed sequence preference allows phosphorylation of an estimated 200–300 substrates, including transcription factors and regulatory enzymes involved in stress and inflammatory responses (Cargnello & Roux, 2011; Burton et al., 2021; Shi & Gaestel, 2002).  

## Structure  
MAPK11 adopts the canonical bilobal protein kinase fold: a β-sheet-rich N-terminal lobe and an α-helical C-terminal lobe. Key structural features include:  
• An activation loop bearing the dual-phosphorylation Thr-Gly-Tyr (TGY) motif required for activation.  
• A docking site (DPED motif) that mediates interactions with upstream MKK3/MKK6 and downstream substrates.  
• An ATP-binding cleft bordered by a regulatory C-helix and adjacent hydrophobic pockets that accommodate ATP or small-molecule inhibitors (Cargnello & Roux, 2011; Roux & Blenis, 2004; Shi & Gaestel, 2002).  

## Regulation  
Activation is achieved through dual phosphorylation of the TGY motif by the MAP2Ks MKK3 and MKK6. Inactivation occurs via MAP kinase phosphatases that dephosphorylate this loop. Scaffold/adaptor proteins modulate sub-cellular localisation and timing of activation, and ATP-competitive inhibitors can allosterically restrain catalytic activity (Cargnello & Roux, 2011; Burton et al., 2021; Shi & Gaestel, 2002).  

## Function  
MAPK11 is a central component of the cellular stress-response pathway. Upon stimulation by environmental stressors or pro-inflammatory cytokines it phosphorylates:  
• Downstream kinases MAPKAPK2/3 and MNK1/2, propagating signals that regulate mRNA stability and translation.  
• Nuclear transcription factors (e.g., ATF1/2, p53, NF-κB family members) to drive immediate-early gene expression.  
• Proteins controlling mRNA processing, protein turnover, and metalloprotease-mediated ectodomain shedding, thereby influencing inflammatory cascades (Cargnello & Roux, 2011; Burton et al., 2021; Koul, Pal, & Koul, 2013; Shi & Gaestel, 2002).  
Although its signalling spectrum overlaps with MAPK14, differential tissue expression of MAPK11 provides additional layers of pathway fine-tuning (Cargnello & Roux, 2011).  

## Inhibitors  
ATP-competitive compounds such as SB203580 and SB202190 inhibit both MAPK11 and MAPK14 by occupying the conserved ATP-binding pocket (Cargnello & Roux, 2011; Machado et al., 2021).  

## Other Comments  
Because MAPK11 participates broadly in stress and inflammatory signalling, dysregulation of its activity has been linked to various pathologies, and p38 inhibitors remain under investigation as therapeutic agents (Burton et al., 2021; Machado et al., 2021).
