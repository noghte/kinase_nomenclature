## Phylogeny  
STK32B (YANK2) belongs to the AGC protein-kinase group and clusters within the YANK sub-family alongside STK32A (YANK1) and STK32C (YANK3) (Arencibia et al., 2013). Structure-guided hidden-Markov modelling confirms this placement and shows tight clustering with canonical AGC kinases (Modi & Dunbrack, 2019a, 2019b). Within the catalytic domain, STK32B shares 69 % identity with STK32A and 65 % with STK32C (Sorrell et al., 2020). Orthologues are present in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, hagfish and lamprey, indicating emergence in bilaterian animals and absence in fungi (Sorrell et al., 2020).  

## Reaction Catalyzed  
ATP + protein-Ser/Thr ⇌ ADP + protein-O-phospho-Ser/Thr (Shi et al., 2024).  

## Cofactor Requirements  
A requirement for divalent cations has not been reported (Sorrell et al., 2020).  

## Substrate Specificity  
No experimental consensus phosphorylation motif has yet been defined (Sorrell et al., 2020).  

## Structure  
The protein comprises a bilobal kinase core followed by an AGC-type C-terminal extension that includes a turn motif and a non-canonical hydrophobic motif (F-X-X-F-N-R-E) (Arencibia et al., 2013; Sorrell et al., 2020). Key catalytic elements—β3-strand Lys, HRD triad, DFN (Asn in place of Gly), APE motif and a small Val gatekeeper—are conserved (Sorrell et al., 2020). An extended HF-motif α-helix docks onto the N-lobe and stabilises the active conformation independently of hydrophobic-motif phosphorylation (Sorrell et al., 2020). Structural resources include a high-confidence AlphaFold model (AF-Q9NY57-F1); the closest experimental proxy is the STK32A crystal structure at 2.29 Å (PDB 4FR4), which displays an equivalent fold (Sorrell et al., 2020).  

## Regulation  
The Src-family kinase Fyn phosphorylates STK32B/YANK2, initiating downstream signalling (Shi et al., 2024). No additional post-translational modifications or regulatory enzymes have been described (Sorrell et al., 2020).  

## Function  
mRNA is enriched in kidney and lymphoid tissues, and the protein localises mainly to microtubules and cytoplasmic vesicles (Sorrell et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2024). An intronic variant (rs10937625) associates with essential tremor and STK32B is over-expressed in the cerebellar cortex of affected individuals (Müller et al., 2016). Over-expression in cerebellar DAOY cells alters 3,794 genes, enriching axon-guidance, calcium-channel and olfactory-transduction pathways (Liao et al., 2020). Fyn-mediated phosphorylation of YANK2 activates p70S6K through an mTOR-independent route and promotes glioma cell proliferation (Shi et al., 2024).  

## Other Comments  
Genomic deletions implicate STK32B in Ellis-van-Creveld syndrome, and locus variants associate with orofacial clefts (Sorrell et al., 2020). The protein is up-regulated in aggressive breast cancer, down-regulated in oral squamous-cell carcinoma, and a G35E driver mutation has been reported in melanoma (Sorrell et al., 2020). Transcriptomic data suggest cardiovascular pathway involvement, consistent with β-blocker responsiveness observed in essential tremor patients (Liao et al., 2020).
