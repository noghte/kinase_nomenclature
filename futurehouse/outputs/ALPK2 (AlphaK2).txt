1. Phylogeny  
Alpha‐protein kinase 2 (ALPK2), also known as Heart alpha‐protein kinase and identified by UniProt ID Q86TB3, is a member of the atypical alpha‐kinase family that is evolutionarily restricted to vertebrates (hofsteen2018alpk2promotescardiogenesis pages 1-2). This family is distinct from conventional serine/threonine kinases in that its members phosphorylate residues embedded within α‐helical regions rather than linear motifs common to classical kinases. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that ALPK2 clusters with other cardiac‐expressed alpha kinases, particularly ALPK1 and ALPK3, the latter of which shares an identical domain organization featuring an N‐terminal immunoglobulin‐like domain and a second Ig‐like domain immediately preceding the catalytic domain (cheawsamoot2023investigationofalpha pages 26-32). In addition, the overall alpha‐kinase group is recognized as an exceptional branch of the kinome with ancient origins, as supported by comparative studies of kinase evolution (middelbeek2010thealphakinasefamily pages 2-3).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
ALPK2 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to target protein substrates. The general reaction is as follows:  
  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺  
This reaction mechanism is consistent with that of serine/threonine kinases, with the unique aspect for ALPK2 being its recognition of phosphorylation sites located within regions that assume an α-helical conformation (hofsteen2018alpk2promotescardiogenesis pages 11-12).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
Like many kinases, ALPK2 is expected to require divalent metal ions—most commonly Mg²⁺—as a cofactor for its catalytic activity. Although direct experimental validation of ALPK2’s cofactor dependence is not explicitly detailed in the available literature, its inclusion in the alpha-kinase family strongly implies a requirement for Mg²⁺ to facilitate ATP binding and the phosphoryl transfer reaction (hofsteen2018alpk2promotescardiogenesis pages 1-2, middelbeek2010thealphakinasefamily pages 2-3).

4. Substrate Specificity  
Quantitative phosphoproteomic studies have demonstrated that ALPK2 preferentially phosphorylates substrates that contain serine residues immediately followed by a proline residue (SP motif). This subset of substrates is significant in the context of cardiac development, as many target proteins modulated by ALPK2 are involved in the regulation of the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway. The observed specificity for serine-proline motifs is a distinguishing feature of the alpha-kinase family with respect to substrate recognition and underscores its role in modulating cellular differentiation processes (hofsteen2018alpk2promotescardiogenesis pages 11-12, hofsteen2018alpk2promotescardiogenesis pages 12-13).

5. Structure  
The structural organization of ALPK2 encompasses a conserved C-terminal alpha-kinase domain responsible for its catalytic activity. This domain is characterized by an atypical kinase fold that diverges from the classical bilobal architecture typical of conventional kinases. Structural predictions, such as those generated by AlphaFold, indicate that ALPK2 comprises an N-terminal region containing one or more immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domains, followed by a linker region and the catalytic alpha-kinase domain at the C-terminus (cheawsamoot2023investigationofalpha pages 26-32). The kinase domain itself is organized into an N-lobe and a C-lobe that together form the ATP-binding pocket; however, unlike canonical kinases, ALPK2 exhibits a unique glycine-rich loop motif positioned in a manner that supports phosphate positioning for substrates with α-helical conformations (middelbeek2010thealphakinasefamily pages 4-5). Currently, no experimentally resolved three-dimensional structure of ALPK2 exists, but computational models support the presence of these key structural features that are essential for its atypical kinase activity (hofsteen2018alpk2promotescardiogenesis pages 2-3).

6. Regulation  
ALPK2 is regulated predominantly at the expression level and through its functional impact on signaling pathways critical for heart development. During the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into cardiac progenitor cells, ALPK2 expression is markedly induced in parallel with activating epigenetic modifications such as increased H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 marks at its gene locus (hofsteen2018alpk2promotescardiogenesis pages 3-5). Functionally, ALPK2 acts as a negative regulator of WNT/β-catenin signaling; loss-of-function studies via shRNA knockdown or CRISPR/Cas9-induced mutations result in increased stabilization of β-catenin and heightened activity of downstream transcription factors including LEF1, indicative of an upregulation in canonical WNT signaling components (hofsteen2018alpk2promotescardiogenesis pages 9-11). Although detailed information regarding post-translational modifications (such as autophosphorylation events or regulatory phosphorylation by upstream kinases) is not available, the phenotypic consequences of ALPK2 depletion emphasize its critical autoregulatory role in maintaining the balance between WNT pathway activation and repression during cardiomyocyte differentiation (hofsteen2018alpk2promotescardiogenesis pages 12-13).

7. Function  
ALPK2 plays an essential role in the regulation of cardiac development and cardiomyocyte differentiation. It is highly expressed in cardiac progenitor cells and developing cardiomyocytes, where its expression is induced during the transition from mesoderm to the cardiac lineage (hofsteen2018alpk2promotescardiogenesis pages 1-2). Functional studies in zebrafish and human pluripotent stem cell models have demonstrated that ALPK2 promotes cardiogenesis by negatively regulating the WNT/β-catenin signaling cascade—an essential step for proper cardiac fate determination. Loss-of-function experiments involving antisense knockdown or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis of ALPK2 result in increased β-catenin stabilization, elevated expression of WNT target genes, reduced expression of key cardiac transcription factors (such as TBX5 and ISL1), and diminished expression of the cardiomyocyte marker TNNT2, collectively leading to impaired cardiovascular development (hofsteen2018alpk2promotescardiogenesis pages 9-11, hofsteen2018alpk2promotescardiogenesis pages 6-7). Moreover, a recent study published in The FASEB Journal has expanded the functional profile of ALPK2 to adult cardiac physiology. In murine models mimicking heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), ALPK2 deficiency exacerbates cardiac diastolic dysfunction, whereas overexpression of ALPK2 enhances the phosphorylation of tropomyosin 1 (TPM1) at Ser283, correlating with reduced myocardial stiffness and improved diastolic performance (yoshida2024alpk2preventscardiac pages 1-2, yoshida2024alpk2preventscardiac pages 7-9). These findings indicate that ALPK2 is involved not only in cardiac development but also in the maintenance of adult myocardial function.

8. Other Comments  
No specific small molecule inhibitors targeting ALPK2 have been reported in the peer-reviewed literature referenced herein. Disease associations with ALPK2 are primarily linked to its critical role in cardiogenesis; experimental depletion of ALPK2 leads to cardiac developmental defects in model systems, suggesting its potential involvement in congenital cardiac malformations. In addition, recent evidence indicates that reduced ALPK2 expression in adult cardiac tissue is associated with diastolic dysfunction in HFpEF, implying a role in the prevention of age-related or stress-induced cardiac impairment (yoshida2024alpk2preventscardiac pages 7-9). Although pathogenic mutations in ALPK2 have not been extensively characterized relative to other alpha kinases such as ALPK3, the tissue-specific expression of ALPK2 as Heart alpha-protein kinase reinforces its significance as a molecular player in heart development and function (hofsteen2018alpk2promotescardiogenesis pages 1-2).
