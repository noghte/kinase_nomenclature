1. Phylogeny  
Alpha‐protein kinase 3 (ALPK3; UniProt Q96L96), also designated as KIAA1330 or MAK in muscle, belongs to the alpha‐kinase family—a small, atypical group of serine/threonine kinases that are evolutionarily distinct from classical protein kinases (agarwal2022pathogenesisofcardiomyopathy pages 2-3, kannan2007structuralandfunctional pages 1-2, krupa2002therepertoireof pages 1-2). ALPK3 is one of six known human alpha kinases, which include eEF2K, TRPM6, TRPM7, ALPK1, and ALPK2; within this subgroup, it is most closely related to ALPK1 and ALPK2, suggesting that these kinases arose from ancient gene duplication events during early metazoan evolution (agarwal2022pathogenesisofcardiomyopathy pages 2-3, krupa2002therepertoireof pages 1-2). Comparative genomic analyses have demonstrated that ALPK3 orthologs exist among vertebrates, and its expression is particularly enriched in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues, indicating a conserved role in muscle biology (agarwal2022pathogenesisofcardiomyopathy pages 2-3, kannan2007structuralandfunctional pages 1-2). Phylogenetic studies based on conserved catalytic domains and sequence motifs—as described in comprehensive surveys of the protein kinase complement—place ALPK3 among kinases with atypical active site configurations, thereby establishing a distinct evolutionary lineage for ALPK3 within the kinome (krupa2002therepertoireof pages 1-2, kannan2007structuralandfunctional pages 1-2). This evolutionary context underscores the divergence of ALPK3 from conventional kinases, informed by key residue substitutions that have rendered its catalytic domain functionally inactive; thus, ALPK3 is classified as a pseudokinase despite retaining the overall structural framework typical of active kinases (agarwal2022pathogenesisofcardiomyopathy pages 15-17, krupa2002therepertoireof pages 4-5).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
In an archetypal protein kinase reaction, ATP serves as the phosphate donor to transfer a phosphate group onto the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues present in substrate proteins, concomitantly generating ADP and a proton; that is, the reaction follows the scheme: ATP + [protein]-OH → ADP + [protein]-O‑phosphate + H⁺ (agarwal2022pathogenesisofcardiomyopathy pages 1-2). However, despite harboring a C-terminal region with sequence similarity to the catalytic domains found in active kinases, extensive phosphoproteomic analyses have consistently demonstrated that ALPK3 does not catalyze such phosphorylation reactions, a finding that has confirmed its pseudokinase status (agarwal2022pathogenesisofcardiomyopathy pages 15-17). Multiple studies using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and overexpression systems have revealed minimal differences in phosphorylation patterns between ALPK3-deficient and wild-type samples, thereby indicating that the conventional kinase reaction is not mediated by ALPK3 (agarwal2022pathogenesisofcardiomyopathy pages 8-9). Thus, while the formal reaction catalyzed by a classical serine/threonine kinase is well established, ALPK3 appears instead to function in a regulatory capacity independent of direct catalytic activity (agarwal2022pathogenesisofcardiomyopathy pages 1-2).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
Classically, protein kinases require divalent cations—most commonly Mg²⁺—to coordinate ATP binding and facilitate phosphate transfer during enzymatic catalysis (agarwal2022pathogenesisofcardiomyopathy pages 1-2, feng2025αproteinkinase pages 1-2). For ALPK3, however, no direct evidence has been obtained demonstrating a dependence on such cofactors for catalytic function, an observation that is in keeping with its characterization as a pseudokinase; that is, the typical requirement for magnesium or other divalent ions is not observed within the functional context of ALPK3 (agarwal2022pathogenesisofcardiomyopathy pages 1-2, feng2025αproteinkinase pages 1-2). Although ALPK3 retains a domain architecture that implies ATP binding in a manner analogous to active kinases, the absence of detectable phosphorylation activity precludes the establishment of definitive cofactor requirements beyond those generally ascribed to serine/threonine kinases (agarwal2022pathogenesisofcardiomyopathy pages 15-17).

4. Substrate Specificity  
For many serine/threonine kinases, substrate specificity is determined by the recognition of consensus amino acid motifs—exemplified by motifs such as RxRxxp[ST] observed in substrates of several AGC family members (agarwal2022pathogenesisofcardiomyopathy pages 8-9, agarwal2022pathogenesisofcardiomyopathy pages 15-17). In the case of ALPK3, however, exhaustive phosphoproteomic investigations have not yielded a reproducible consensus substrate motif, and the enzyme fails to phosphorylate putative substrates in vitro; this lack of substrate phosphorylation is consistent with its pseudokinase classification (agarwal2022pathogenesisofcardiomyopathy pages 8-9, agarwal2022pathogenesisofcardiomyopathy pages 15-17). As a result, a consensus substrate motif for ALPK3 remains undefined, and its functional substrate specificity, in the canonical enzymatic sense, is effectively absent; instead, ALPK3 exerts its biological influence through nonenzymatic, scaffolding roles that impact the localization and stability of key structural proteins (agarwal2022pathogenesisofcardiomyopathy pages 8-9, agarwal2022pathogenesisofcardiomyopathy pages 15-17).

5. Structure  
ALPK3 is a large protein with an approximate molecular weight of 201 kDa and exhibits a multidomain organization that is characteristic of proteins involved in structural scaffolding and signal transduction in cardiac muscle. The N-terminal region of ALPK3 contains two immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domains that are thought to mediate protein-protein interactions critical for muscle cell architecture (agarwal2022pathogenesisofcardiomyopathy pages 2-3, krupa2002therepertoireof pages 4-5). These domains are followed by long stretches of sequence that may be intrinsically disordered, serving as flexible linkers between functional regions. The most prominent feature of ALPK3 is its C-terminal alpha kinase domain; despite its structural resemblance to canonical kinase domains, sequence alignments and mutational analyses have revealed substitutions at key conserved residues—such as those necessary for ATP binding and phosphoryl transfer—which abrogate enzymatic function and designate ALPK3 as a pseudokinase (agarwal2022pathogenesisofcardiomyopathy pages 1-2, agarwal2022pathogenesisofcardiomyopathy pages 15-17). In addition to its primary sequence features, ALPK3 is characterized by a nuclear localization signal that enables its accumulation in the cardiomyocyte nucleus, as well as a localization signal that directs a portion of the protein to the sarcomere M-band, where it colocalizes with structural proteins such as myomesin (MYOM1 and MYOM2) (agarwal2022pathogenesisofcardiomyopathy pages 1-2, agarwal2022pathogenesisofcardiomyopathy pages 15-17, lopes2021alphaproteinkinase3 pages 2-3). Although high-resolution crystallographic or cryo-electron microscopy data for ALPK3 are not presently available, in silico structural predictions and comparative modeling based on related kinase structures suggest that ALPK3 adopts a kinase fold with an atypical configuration of the activation loop, hydrophobic spine, and C-helix, consistent with its loss of catalytic function (krupa2002therepertoireof pages 4-5, agarwal2022pathogenesisofcardiomyopathy pages 2-3).

6. Regulation  
Classical regulation of protein kinases typically involves post-translational modifications, primarily phosphorylation events that modulate enzyme activity and substrate affinity (agarwal2022pathogenesisofcardiomyopathy pages 1-2, herkert2020expandingtheclinical pages 3-4). In contrast, ALPK3, due to its pseudokinase status, exhibits minimal autophosphorylation or phosphorylation-dependent activation. Empirical studies in both patient tissues and in vitro cell models have demonstrated that only a small number of phosphosites on ALPK3 itself show altered phosphorylation levels in the context of loss-of-function mutations, and these changes do not translate into measurable catalytic activity (agarwal2022pathogenesisofcardiomyopathy pages 15-17, hespe2025clinicalvalidityof pages 4-7). Regulatory control of ALPK3 appears to be mediated predominantly through its spatial distribution and its ability to form specific protein complexes, as evidenced by its interaction with myomesin proteins at the sarcomere M-band and its localization to the nuclear envelope in differentiating cardiomyocytes (agarwal2022pathogenesisofcardiomyopathy pages 1-2, lopes2021alphaproteinkinase3 pages 7-8). Furthermore, analyses of cardiomyopathic tissues have revealed disruptions in signaling pathways associated with protein turnover, such as those involving muscle RING-finger protein 1 (MuRF1) and calpain 3 (CAPN3), indicating that aberrant regulatory interactions may underlie the structural defects observed in ALPK3 deficiency (agarwal2022pathogenesisofcardiomyopathy pages 17-18, hespe2025clinicalvalidityof pages 4-7). No specific small molecule or allosteric regulator has been identified that modulates ALPK3 function, and current evidence suggests that its regulatory role is largely executed through nonenzymatic protein interactions rather than through conventional post-translational modification mechanisms (agarwal2022pathogenesisofcardiomyopathy pages 15-17, hespe2025clinicalvalidityof pages 4-7).

7. Function  
ALPK3 is expressed predominantly in the heart, particularly in cardiomyocytes where it has been shown to play an essential role in cardiac development and the maintenance of sarcomere integrity. Functionally, ALPK3 is required for proper cardiomyocyte differentiation, with a significant impact on both nuclear and sarcomeric architecture (agarwal2022pathogenesisofcardiomyopathy pages 1-2, lopes2021alphaproteinkinase3 pages 2-3). At the molecular level, ALPK3 functions as a structural scaffold that orchestrates the proper localization of myomesin proteins (MYOM1 and MYOM2) to the M-band of the sarcomere, which is critical for force buffering during cardiac contraction (agarwal2022pathogenesisofcardiomyopathy pages 1-2, agarwal2022pathogenesisofcardiomyopathy pages 15-17). Disruption of ALPK3, whether through truncating mutations or loss-of-function variants, results in mislocalization and accumulation of myomesin proteins, impaired sarcomere structure, and alterations in the levels of other thick filament proteins; these molecular defects manifest clinically as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in adults and severe pediatric cardiomyopathy characterized by dilated phenotypes in early onset cases (agarwal2022pathogenesisofcardiomyopathy pages 17-18, lopes2021alphaproteinkinase3 pages 7-8). Moreover, analysis of ALPK3 mutant cardiomyocytes has revealed secondary changes in the phosphorylation profiles of proteins involved in the regulation of calcium handling and contractility—phenomena that further compromise cardiac function (lopes2021alphaproteinkinase3 pages 2-3, hespe2025clinicalvalidityof pages 1-4). Thus, ALPK3 plays a dual role by integrating structural scaffolding functions with the modulation of proteostasis within the cardiomyocyte, ultimately contributing to the maintenance of myocardial contractile performance (agarwal2022pathogenesisofcardiomyopathy pages 1-2, herkert2020expandingtheclinical pages 3-4).

8. Other Comments  
Although ALPK3 harbors a kinase-like domain, its functional profile is consistent with that of a pseudokinase, and no robust catalytic activity has been detected despite numerous studies employing phosphoproteomic and in vitro kinase assays (agarwal2022pathogenesisofcardiomyopathy pages 15-17, agarwal2022pathogenesisofcardiomyopathy pages 8-9). Correspondingly, no selective inhibitors have been developed that target ALPK3’s catalytic activity; however, therapeutic intervention with compounds such as mavacamten—a myosin ATPase inhibitor—has demonstrated partial rescue of the cardiomyopathic phenotypes associated with ALPK3 truncation variants in experimental models (lopes2021alphaproteinkinase3 pages 7-8, ryu2024highprevalenceof pages 5-6). Disease association studies have established that both homozygous and heterozygous loss-of-function variants in ALPK3 are causally linked to a spectrum of cardiomyopathies, ranging from severe early-onset pediatric dilated cardiomyopathy to autosomal dominant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in adults; these genetic findings have been validated in multiple cohorts and familial segregation analyses (lopes2021alphaproteinkinase3 pages 2-3, ryu2024highprevalenceof pages 1-2, li2023anovelcompound pages 11-11). Notable mutations include truncating variants such as the K201X mutation, which abrogate the integrity of the kinase domain and thereby compromise the protein’s scaffolding function, ultimately leading to myocardial fibrosis, altered cardiac remodeling, and diminished contractile performance (lopes2021alphaproteinkinase3 pages 7-8, li2023anovelcompound pages 11-11). These observations have positioned ALPK3 as a clinically relevant target for diagnostic screening in patients with unexplained cardiomyopathy, and they underscore its fundamental importance in preserving cardiac structural integrity (agarwal2022pathogenesisofcardiomyopathy pages 17-18, hespe2025clinicalvalidityof pages 1-4).
