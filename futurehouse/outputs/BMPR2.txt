1. Phylogeny  
BMPR2 is an evolutionarily conserved type II receptor in the transforming growth factor‐β (TGF‐β) superfamily and is a member of the serine/threonine kinase family found in all vertebrates. Its orthologs are broadly present across species, and it shares significant sequence and structural similarity with related receptors such as activin receptor type IIA (ACVR2A) and activin receptor type IIB (ACVR2B), yet BMPR2 is distinguished by a long cytoplasmic tail not present in those paralogues (duffhuesUnknownyeardikep. pages 1-3, gomez‐puerto2019bonemorphogeneticprotein pages 2-4).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
BMPR2 functions as a serine/threonine kinase that catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP onto specific hydroxyl groups of serine or threonine residues present in its substrates. In the canonical BMP signaling pathway, BMPR2 phosphorylates its associated type I receptors, which then autophosphorylate further before phosphorylating receptor‐regulated SMADs, thereby initiating downstream transcriptional responses (barnes2016bonemorphogenicprotein pages 1-5).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The catalytic activity of BMPR2 is dependent on ATP as a phosphate donor and requires the presence of divalent metal ions, most commonly Mg²⁺, to support efficient phosphoryl transfer during the kinase reaction (gomez‐puerto2019bonemorphogeneticprotein pages 8-9).

4. Substrate Specificity  
BMPR2 exhibits substrate specificity for serine/threonine residues located in the GS domain of type I BMP receptors as well as in the C-terminal SXS motif of receptor‐regulated SMAD proteins (SMAD1, SMAD5, and SMAD8). This kinase preferentially phosphorylates these substrates upon formation of heteromeric complexes with type I receptors, thereby ensuring specific propagation of the BMP signal (gomez‐puerto2019bonemorphogeneticprotein pages 5-6).

5. Structure  
BMPR2 is organized into several distinct domains. Its N‐terminal extracellular region is cysteine‐rich and contains multiple N‐linked glycosylation sites—most notably at asparagine residues that enhance ligand binding—which is critical for stabilizing its interaction with BMP ligands such as BMP2 and BMP7 (lowery2014nlinkedglycosylationof pages 3-4). This domain is followed by a single transmembrane helix that anchors the receptor in the plasma membrane. The intracellular region harbors a serine/threonine kinase domain containing conserved catalytic motifs such as the activation loop and C‐helix, and it terminates in an unusually long C‐terminal tail that is unique among BMP type II receptors and may mediate additional regulatory interactions (guo2022crystalstructuresof pages 1-2, duffhuesUnknownyeardikep. pages 4-5).

6. Regulation  
BMPR2 activity is regulated by several mechanisms. Post‐translational modification by N‐linked glycosylation of its extracellular domain enhances ligand binding and receptor stability (lowery2014nlinkedglycosylationof pages 3-4). Upon BMP ligand binding, BMPR2 forms heteromeric receptor complexes with type I receptors, a process that is essential for triggering both the canonical SMAD signaling cascade and non‐SMAD pathways such as the p38MAPK cascade (gomez‐puerto2019bonemorphogeneticprotein pages 2-4). In addition, the receptor is subject to regulation via receptor trafficking, internalization, and degradation, and mutations that disrupt proper receptor complex assembly or intracellular trafficking lead to reduced signaling capacity and altered downstream pathway activation (hiepen2019bmpr2actsas pages 22-24).

7. Function  
BMPR2 plays a central role in mediating bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling by binding BMP ligands—including BMP7 and BMP2, and to a lesser extent BMP4—and forming receptor complexes with type I receptors, which in turn phosphorylate and activate receptor‐regulated SMAD transcription factors. This canonical signaling pathway regulates gene expression programs involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Furthermore, BMPR2 can also initiate non‐SMAD signaling cascades such as the p38MAPK pathway. In addition to its critical role in skeletal development and adipogenesis induction (e.g., by GDF6), BMPR2 is predominantly expressed in pulmonary arterial endothelial cells where its proper function is essential to maintain vascular homeostasis; mutations in BMPR2 are known to be the primary genetic drivers of both familial pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and a significant subset of idiopathic cases (barnes2016bonemorphogenicprotein pages 1-5, frump2018bmpr2mutationsand pages 1-2, song2005increasedsusceptibilityto pages 9-10).

8. Other Comments  
Recent chemical biology efforts have led to the discovery of highly potent and BMPR2‐selective kinase inhibitors discovered via DNA‐encoded chemical library screening, offering novel avenues for therapeutic intervention in diseases associated with overactive or dysregulated BMP signaling (modukuri2023discoveryofhighly pages 1-2). Additionally, a wide spectrum of BMPR2 mutations, many of which result in loss‐of‐function, has been documented; these mutations exhibit incomplete penetrance in familial PAH and contribute to disease pathogenesis by impairing receptor trafficking, complex formation, and subsequent downstream signaling (teichertkuliszewska2006bonemorphogeneticprotein pages 1-3, duffhuesUnknownyeardikep. pages 13-13). Inhibitors specifically targeting BMPR2 have not been extensively characterized compared to those affecting type I BMP receptors; nevertheless, modulation of BMPR2 activity remains a highly active area of preclinical research with significant implications for the treatment of pulmonary vascular diseases (hiepen2019bmpr2actsas pages 46-47).
