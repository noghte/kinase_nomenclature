1. Phylogeny  
Cyclin‐dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) is an evolutionarily conserved member of the CMGC kinase group, sharing high sequence and functional similarity with well‐studied yeast cell cycle regulators such as CDC2 in fission yeast and CDC28 in budding yeast. CDK1 is found in all eukaryotic organisms and can be traced back to an ancestral kinase present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor. Its evolutionary conservation is evident from genomic and phylogenetic analyses that group CDK1 alongside other cell cycle–regulating kinases, highlighting its critical role in driving mitosis across species (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 1-2, liu2000evolutionofcyclindependent pages 1-1, hanks1995theeukaryoticprotein pages 5-6).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
CDK1 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to target proteins on serine or threonine residues. In its catalytic reaction, ATP binds to the kinase along with the substrate protein, which then results in the formation of ADP and a phosphorylated protein product. This phosphorylation reaction is written as:  
  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺  
This mechanism is fundamental for altering the activity, stability or subcellular localization of numerous substrates involved in cell cycle regulation (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 1-2, hanks1995theeukaryoticprotein pages 5-6).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The catalytic activity of CDK1 is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions, specifically Mg²⁺, which are essential cofactors. Mg²⁺ ions coordinate with ATP to facilitate the proper positioning of the phosphate groups for transfer and are required for optimal kinase activity across the CDK family (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 1-2, hanks1995theeukaryoticprotein pages 5-6).

4. Substrate Specificity  
CDK1 exhibits substrate specificity characterized by its preference for serine/threonine residues followed by a proline residue, which is encapsulated in the consensus motif S/T-P. This preference is dictated primarily by the conformation of the active site and involves recognition of sequences in target substrates that are often primed by prior phosphorylation events or influenced by cyclin binding. The kinase’s substrate specificity is further modulated by its association with specific cyclin partners, which not only activate CDK1 but also help determine the subset of substrates recognized during different cell cycle phases (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 3-5, wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 22-23).

5. Structure  
CDK1 consists of a conserved kinase domain that is organized into two principal lobes: a smaller N-terminal lobe rich in beta-sheets and a larger C-terminal lobe primarily composed of alpha-helices. A defining feature of CDK1 is the highly conserved PSTAIRE motif located in the αC-helix, which is critical for cyclin binding and subsequent activation of the kinase. The activation segment, which includes a T-loop, undergoes conformational rearrangements upon cyclin binding; its phosphorylation by CDK-activating kinases (CAKs) is required for full enzyme activity. In addition, the catalytic cleft is positioned between the two lobes, providing the binding site for ATP and facilitating the transfer of the phosphate group to substrates. The overall structural organization of CDK1, including the arrangement of its glycine-rich loop, hinge region, and catalytic residues, has been illuminated by crystallographic studies of related CDK–cyclin complexes, illustrating a typical serine/threonine kinase fold with conserved features that are shared with other members of the CDK family (wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 3-4, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 7-8).

6. Regulation  
CDK1 activity is regulated by a complex network of mechanisms that include association with cyclin proteins, phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events, and interactions with inhibitory proteins. Activation of CDK1 generally requires binding to mitotic cyclins (most notably cyclin B) or, under certain circumstances, interphase cyclins; this association induces structural changes that reposition the T-loop, allowing substrate access. Full activation further depends on phosphorylation of a conserved threonine residue in the T-loop (analogous to Thr161 in CDK2), which is catalyzed by a CDK-activating kinase (typically CDK7 within the CAK complex). Conversely, CDK1 is negatively regulated through inhibitory phosphorylation at residues corresponding to Thr14 and Tyr15 by kinases such as WEE1 and MYT1; these phosphorylations keep the kinase inactive until they are removed by the CDC25 family of phosphatases. This precise regulation ensures that CDK1 activity is coordinated with cell cycle progression, particularly at the G2-M transition and during mitotic events such as centrosome separation, nuclear envelope breakdown, and chromosome condensation. In addition to post-translational modifications, the dynamic levels of cyclin binding partners and the action of specific CDK inhibitors further contribute to the tight regulation of CDK1 (wang2023targetingcdk1in pages 1-2, malumbres2005mammaliancyclindependentkinases pages 7-8, hanks1995theeukaryoticprotein pages 5-6).

7. Function  
CDK1 is a master regulator of the eukaryotic cell cycle, playing a central role in orchestrating the G2-M transition and driving the onset of mitosis. Once activated, CDK1 phosphorylates numerous substrates that are critical for a wide range of mitotic events including centrosome separation, Golgi fragmentation, nuclear envelope breakdown, and chromosome condensation. The extensive substrate profile of CDK1 includes key proteins such as components of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), retinoblastoma protein (RB1), lamin proteins (LMNA, LMNB1, LMNB2), and a variety of mitotic spindle regulators. CDK1-mediated phosphorylation also modulates transcription factors, cell cycle checkpoint proteins, apoptosis regulators, and proteins involved in cytoskeletal reorganization. Expression studies indicate that CDK1 is ubiquitously expressed in proliferating cells and is essential for early embryonic development, with complete loss resulting in embryonic lethality. Its function is tightly integrated with upstream regulators (including cyclins and CAKs) and downstream effectors that together ensure the faithful execution of cell division. The kinase’s activity is also implicated in DNA damage checkpoint control, where its inhibition allows time for repair mechanisms prior to mitotic entry. Thus, through its ability to phosphorylate a broad array of substrates, CDK1 coordinates multiple aspects of cell cycle progression and mitotic execution, underscoring its pivotal role in cellular proliferation (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 5-6, wang2023targetingcdk1in pages 12-13, wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 20-20).

8. Other Comments  
Several small molecule inhibitors targeting CDK1 and related kinases have been evaluated as potential anticancer agents due to the kinase’s central role in cell division. Agents such as dinaciclib and flavopiridol have been studied in clinical settings, with the aim of inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in tumor cells. Dysregulation of CDK1 has been associated with a variety of cancers; overexpression or aberrant activation contributes to uncontrolled proliferation, chromosomal instability, and therapeutic resistance. Moreover, mutations that affect CDK1 regulation or its interacting partners can compromise cell cycle checkpoints and promote tumorigenesis. As a result, CDK1 continues to be a high-priority target for the development of new chemotherapeutic strategies. Research efforts also focus on combination therapies that target CDK1 together with other signaling pathways to improve treatment outcomes. Although many inhibitors are experimental and their specificity varies, ongoing clinical trials highlight the therapeutic potential of precise CDK1 suppression in oncology (wang2023targetingcdk1in pages 5-8, malumbres2005mammaliancyclindependentkinases pages 9-10).
