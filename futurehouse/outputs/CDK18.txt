1. Phylogeny  
CDK18, also known as PCTAIRE3 or PCTK3, belongs to the PCTAIRE subfamily of cyclin‐dependent kinases that diverged from the classical cell cycle regulators such as CDK1 and CDK2. The PCTAIRE kinases are evolutionarily conserved among higher eukaryotes and can be traced back to organisms with a centralized nervous system. Orthologs of CDK18 have been identified throughout mammalian species, with particular enrichment in tissues such as brain and testis, supporting its conserved role in post‐mitotic cells. Phylogenetically, CDK18 groups with other atypical CDKs that share unique sequence motifs—most notably, the substitution of a serine for the canonical proline in the PSTAIRE motif, resulting instead in a PCTAIRE sequence. This feature distinguishes the PCTAIRE kinases from canonical family members and suggests that they have evolved specialized functions possibly linked to signaling in differentiated cells (cole2009pctkproteinsthe pages 1-2, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 2-4).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
CDK18 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of a serine or threonine residue on a substrate protein. In biochemical terms, the reaction is as follows:  
  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺  
This reaction, common to serine/threonine kinases, underlies its regulatory role in phosphorylating substrates involved in cell cycle checkpoints and signal transduction cascades (barone2016humancdk18promotes pages 1-1).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The catalytic activity of CDK18, like most serine/threonine protein kinases, is dependent upon divalent metal ions. In particular, Mg²⁺ is required as a cofactor to facilitate the proper coordination of ATP within the active site and to enable the ensuing phosphoryl transfer reaction. This cofactor requirement is a shared characteristic among kinases of the CMGC group and contributes to the structural stabilization of the ATP–protein kinase complex (shah2020cdksfamilya pages 8-9).

4. Substrate Specificity  
The substrate specificity of CDK18 is characterized by a preference for phosphorylating serine/threonine residues, and it is thought to exhibit a proline-directed substrate preference akin to other CDKs. Although the detailed consensus substrate motif for CDK18 has not been comprehensively delineated, published studies indicate that its kinase activity involves phosphorylation events on substrates that contain proline-directed serine/threonine motifs. Experimentally, CDK18 has been implicated in the phosphorylation of several key regulatory proteins; for example, it plays a role in the replication stress response by modulating the phosphorylation status of proteins such as RAD9, and it influences tau protein phosphorylation at residues Thr231 and Ser235 in neuronal cells. Such phosphorylation events are consistent with the reported roles of CDK18 in genome integrity and in neuronal signal transduction pathways (cole2009pctkproteinsthe pages 8-10, pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 7-9).

5. Structure  
CDK18 is approximately 500 amino acids in length and has a domain organization typical of the CDK family, but with distinct features that set it apart from canonical cell cycle kinases. Its central kinase domain comprises the bi‐lobed structure seen in other CDKs: an N-terminal lobe primarily responsible for ATP binding and a larger C-terminal lobe that contains substrate-binding elements. The kinase domain includes conserved motifs such as the HRD sequence in subdomain VI and the DFG sequence in subdomain VII, both of which are essential for catalytic activity and Mg²⁺ coordination.  
In addition to the catalytic domain, CDK18 contains extended N-terminal and short C-terminal regions that are unique and may contribute to its regulation and substrate interactions. The N-terminal extension includes the so-called “PCTAIRE box,” which is distinctive for this subfamily and is thought to mediate interactions with regulatory cyclin partners, such as cyclin A2 and possibly cyclin Y. Although no high-resolution crystal structure has been reported specifically for CDK18, homology models based on the resolved structure of the related CDK16 suggest that CDK18 adopts a typical CDK fold with a well-conserved catalytic core. Key regulatory features likely include an activation loop subject to phosphorylation and a C-helix that plays a role in positioning key residues required for catalysis. Additionally, the presence of a putative Protein Kinase A (PKA) substrate motif (R-R-X-S) in its N-terminal extension indicates that phosphorylation mediated by PKA may modulate the conformation and activation state of CDK18 (pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 1-2, cole2009pctkproteinsthe pages 1-2, endicott2013structuralcharacterizationof pages 3-5, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 2-4).

6. Regulation  
The regulation of CDK18 occurs through multiple mechanisms that are characteristic of both classical and atypical cyclin-dependent kinases. One key regulatory mechanism involves binding to cyclins—most notably cyclin A2—and this interaction is critical for the activation of its kinase activity. In addition to cyclin binding, CDK18 is regulated by phosphorylation events; Protein Kinase A (PKA) has been shown to phosphorylate CDK18 at specific serine residues (for instance, a reported modification at Ser12) that enhance its activity, even in the absence of cyclin A2. Phosphorylation within the activation loop of the kinase domain is believed to be an important regulatory cue, although the precise sites and enzymes involved remain an area of active investigation.  
Furthermore, CDK18 is subject to regulation via interactions with other regulatory proteins; for example, binding to members of the 14-3-3 family and ubiquitination machinery (such as the E3 ubiquitin ligase STUB1) may impact its subcellular localization and stability. These regulatory mechanisms enable tight temporal and spatial control of CDK18 activity, ensuring its involvement in replication stress signaling and neuronal function occurs in a regulated manner (barone2016humancdk18promotes pages 12-13, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 13-14, cole2009pctkproteinsthe pages 7-8, pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 1-2).

7. Function  
CDK18 may play a critical role in signal transduction cascades in terminally differentiated cells. Its biological functions extend beyond the canonical roles of cell cycle progression to include maintenance of genome stability and modulation of neuronal signaling.  
One of the best-characterized functions of CDK18 is its involvement in the replication stress response. Experimental evidence indicates that CDK18 facilitates the ATR-mediated signaling cascade during replication stress by promoting the chromatin retention of key checkpoint proteins such as RAD9 and RAD17. By ensuring robust ATR activation, CDK18 contributes to the stabilization of stalled replication forks and helps maintain genome integrity (barone2016humancdk18promotes pages 1-1, pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 7-9).  
In neuronal systems, CDK18 is expressed predominantly in post-mitotic cells including neurons and oligodendrocytes. In these contexts, CDK18 has been associated with the phosphorylation of tau protein at residues Thr231 and Ser235, modifications that have been observed in Alzheimer’s disease models. Through its action on tau and potential interactions with other regulatory proteins in neuronal signaling pathways, CDK18 may influence processes related to neurite outgrowth and synaptic function (cole2009pctkproteinsthe pages 8-10, pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 13-14).  
Moreover, CDK18 appears to influence cell adhesion and migration. Data suggest that it modulates the phosphorylation state of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), thereby impacting cytoskeletal reorganization and cellular motility. Such functions are particularly relevant in the context of tumor biology where alterations in cell adhesion and migration can contribute to cancer progression. Expression analyses reveal that CDK18 is differentially expressed in several human tissues, with notable expression in brain, heart, testis, and spinal cord, and differential regulation in pathological conditions such as cancer, metabolic disorders, and neurodegeneration (pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 6-7, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 9-10).

8. Other Comments  
CDK18 has emerged as a protein of interest given its multifaceted roles in both genome maintenance and signal transduction in terminally differentiated cells. Recent gene copy number analyses in human cancers have revealed that CDK18 exhibits copy number gains in a significant fraction of breast cancers, and its deregulation has been associated with resistance to replication stress–inducing chemotherapeutic agents in glioblastoma. Furthermore, expression studies indicate that CDK18 may be linked to metabolic regulation in pancreatic islets as well as to psychiatric and neurodegenerative conditions, including depression, Alzheimer’s disease, and demyelinating disorders.  
On the therapeutic front, the unique regulation and substrate specificity of CDK18 distinguish it from classical CDKs and render it a potential target for the development of selective inhibitors. Although no highly specific pharmacological inhibitors targeting CDK18 have yet entered clinical practice, ongoing inhibitor development efforts are exploring compounds that exploit its unique structural features and regulatory mechanisms. The convergence of its roles in ATR signaling, tau phosphorylation, and modulation of cell adhesion highlights the potential of CDK18 as a biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology and in neurological diseases (pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 11-13, pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 14-16, chaput2016potentialroleof pages 16-17, chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 21-22).
