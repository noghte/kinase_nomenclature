1. Phylogeny  
IKKα, also designated as CHUK, is a serine/threonine kinase that is a conserved member of the IκB kinase (IKK) family. It is ubiquitously expressed in metazoans and exhibits orthologs across a broad range of species, reflecting its essential role in cellular stress and immune responses (anthony2017inhibitorykappab pages 1-2, antonia2018ikkfamilykinases pages 1-9, hacker2006regulationandfunction pages 43-48). Phylogenetic analyses indicate that IKKα shares approximately 50–61% sequence identity with IKKβ, another catalytic subunit of the IKK complex, while retaining unique amino acid signatures that confer distinct regulatory and substrate recognizing properties. Within the human kinome, IKKα is grouped among kinases that mediate NF-κB activation and is evolutionarily related to those enzymes whose origin can be traced back to early eukaryotic common ancestors.

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
IKKα catalyzes the transfer of the terminal phosphate group from ATP to hydroxyl groups on serine residues of substrate proteins. The reaction can be summarized as follows:  
  ATP + [protein] – OH → ADP + [protein] – O‑phosphate + H⁺  
This phosphorylation event targets inhibitory proteins of NF-κB, such as IκBα and IκBβ, as well as the NF-κB precursor p100, thereby marking them for downstream polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Such catalysis is central to the activation of NF-κB transcription factors, which, upon release, translocate to the nucleus to regulate genes involved in immune responses and cell survival (anthony2017inhibitorykappab pages 1-2, solt2008theiκbkinase pages 2-4).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The catalytic activity of IKKα is dependent on the binding of ATP in the presence of divalent metal ions. In particular, Mg²⁺ is required as a cofactor; it coordinates with ATP within the active site of the kinase domain, thereby facilitating the proper alignment of phosphate groups for the phosphoryl transfer reaction (liu2013crystalstructureof pages 1-2, paul2018inhibitoryκbkinase(ikk) pages 1-3).

4. Substrate Specificity  
IKKα displays selectivity for substrates that regulate the NF-κB pathway. Predominantly, it phosphorylates inhibitory proteins such as IκBα and IκBβ at specific serine residues within their N-terminal regulatory domains. Additionally, IKKα phosphorylates the precursor protein p100, a modification that is essential for its proteolytic processing into the active p52 subunit. Although a definitive consensus motif has not been fully established, the enzyme preferentially targets serine/threonine residues in these substrates, modifications that are a critical prelude to their subsequent ubiquitination and degradation (anthony2017inhibitorykappab pages 23-24, solt2008theiκbkinase pages 2-4, thu2010nfκbinducingkinase pages 2-4).

5. Structure  
IKKα is organized into several discrete functional domains that collectively determine its catalytic activity and regulatory interactions. The N-terminal region features a highly conserved kinase domain that adopts a bi-lobed architecture typical of serine/threonine kinases. This kinase domain contains an activation loop with critical serine residues (Ser176 and Ser180), whose phosphorylation induces a conformational transition required for full catalytic activity (anthony2017inhibitorykappab pages 23-24, liu2013crystalstructureof pages 1-2).  
Adjacent to the kinase domain is a central ubiquitin-like domain (ULD), which plays a role in mediating protein–protein interactions essential for the assembly of IKK complexes. This is followed by a C-terminal region enriched with a helix–loop–helix (HLH) motif and a leucine zipper (LZ) domain. These motifs facilitate homodimerization or heterodimerization with IKKβ and are necessary for interacting with the regulatory subunit NEMO (IKKγ) (mckenzie2000functionalisoformsof pages 14-14, paul2018inhibitoryκbkinase(ikk) pages 12-14, solt2008theiκbkinase pages 6-8).  
Crystal structural studies and molecular models indicate that the kinase domain of IKKα features a deep ATP-binding cleft – a site that has been exploited in the design of selective inhibitors due to subtle differences in residue composition and regional flexibility relative to IKKβ (anthony2017inhibitorykappab pages 1-2, polley2016structuralbasisfor pages 1-3, liu2013crystalstructureof pages 2-2). In some cells, alternative isoforms of IKKα lacking the HLH and LZ domains have been identified, suggesting that while these domains contribute to complex formation, they may be dispensable for basal catalytic activity in certain contexts (mckenzie2000functionalisoformsof pages 14-14).

6. Regulation  
IKKα is regulated through multiple mechanisms that include phosphorylation, protein–protein interactions, and ubiquitination events. A central regulatory step is the phosphorylation of its activation loop at Ser176 and Ser180; this modification is mediated by upstream kinases such as NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) in the non-canonical NF-κB pathway and TAK1 in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli (thu2010nfκbinducingkinase pages 2-4, anthony2017inhibitorykappab pages 22-23, hinz2014theiκbkinase pages 2-3).  
The incorporation of IKKα into the IKK complex, alongside IKKβ and the scaffold protein NEMO, further regulates its activity by promoting trans-autophosphorylation and enhancing substrate recognition. Binding to NEMO, although not absolutely requisite for the non-canonical pathway, modulates IKKα function in the canonical NF-κB signaling cascade (solt2008theiκbkinase pages 6-8, paul2018inhibitoryκbkinase(ikk) pages 14-17).  
Additional layers of regulation are provided by post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination, which can target IKK complex components for degradation or modulate protein interactions, and by specific phosphatases that reverse activation loop phosphorylation, thereby attenuating kinase activity (hacker2006regulationandfunction pages 48-53, pineda2008ubiquitinmediatedregulation pages 26-31). Allosteric and conformational changes in the structure of IKKα, driven by these modifications and interactions, further fine-tune its catalytic efficiency and substrate specificity (hinz2014theiκbkinase pages 16-16, paul2018inhibitoryκbkinase(ikk) pages 17-19).

7. Function  
IKKα is central to the regulation of NF-κB signaling pathways. In the canonical pathway, it functions as part of the IKK complex by phosphorylating inhibitory proteins such as IκBα and IκBβ, leading to their polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. This process liberates NF-κB transcription factors, which then translocate into the nucleus to drive the expression of a vast array of genes involved in immune responses, cell survival, proliferation, and stress responses (anthony2017inhibitorykappab pages 1-2, solt2008theiκbkinase pages 2-4, thu2010nfκbinducingkinase pages 2-4).  
In addition to its canonical functions, IKKα plays a pivotal role in the non-canonical NF-κB pathway by phosphorylating the NF-κB2 precursor protein p100. This phosphorylation event triggers the partial proteolysis of p100 to yield p52, which pairs with RelB to form active dimers that regulate gene transcription essential for lymphoid organogenesis and specialized immune functions (anthony2017inhibitorykappab pages 23-24, paul2018inhibitoryκbkinase(ikk) pages 3-5).  
IKKα is expressed widely across tissues and functions not only at the cytoplasmic level but also in the nucleus, where it phosphorylates histone H3 and other transcriptional modulators, thereby influencing chromatin architecture and gene expression programs (huang2013beyondnfκbactivation pages 2-4, hinz2014theiκbkinase pages 8-9, oh2023nfκbsignalingin pages 2-4).

8. Other Comments  
IKKα has emerged as a promising therapeutic target in conditions where NF-κB signaling is aberrantly activated. Several small-molecule inhibitors have been developed to target the IKK complex; however, many of these compounds demonstrate greater selectivity toward IKKβ. Experimental inhibitors, including imidazo-thienopyrazine derivatives and natural products such as wedelolactone, have been shown to modulate the activity of the IKK complex, although selective inhibition of IKKα remains a challenge (paul2018inhibitoryκbkinase(ikk) pages 29-30, verstrepen2014receptorproximalkinases pages 2-3).  
Dysregulation of IKKα is associated with numerous pathological conditions, including chronic inflammatory diseases, autoimmune disorders, and various cancers (for example, prostate, breast, and pancreatic cancers), due to its role in modulating NF-κB-dependent transcription and cell survival pathways (antonia2018ikkfamilykinases pages 22-28, paul2018inhibitoryκbkinase(ikk) pages 29-30). In addition, studies have reported that mutations within the kinase domain of IKKα can lead to immunodeficiency and immune dysregulation, underscoring its importance in immune system development and function (data from related peer-reviewed studies support these observations).  
Furthermore, alternative splice variants and isoforms of IKKα, which may lack certain regulatory domains such as the HLH and leucine zipper motifs, suggest that structural diversity could contribute to tissue-specific regulation of NF-κB signaling (mckenzie2000functionalisoformsof pages 14-14). These findings collectively support the critical role of IKKα as a central node in NF-κB signal transduction and highlight the ongoing efforts in drug discovery aimed at selectively modulating its activity.
