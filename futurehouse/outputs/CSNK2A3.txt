1. Phylogeny  
Casein kinase II subunit alpha 3 (CSNK2A3/CSNK2A1P, UniProt Q8NEV1) is a member of the highly conserved casein kinase II family, which is ubiquitously expressed across eukaryotic species and belongs to the CMGC group of protein kinases that also includes cyclin‐dependent kinases (CDKs), mitogen‐activated protein kinases (MAPKs), glycogen synthase kinases (GSKs) and Cdc2‐like kinases (CLKs) (cozza2010howdruggableis pages 1-3).  
The principal catalytic subunits of CK2 are traditionally encoded by the genes CSNK2A1 and CSNK2A2, and the CSNK2A3 locus, designated as a processed pseudogene, exhibits a high degree of sequence similarity to CSNK2A1, reflecting its derivation from the ancestral CK2α gene (borgo2021proteinkinaseck2 pages 3-4).  
Orthologs of CK2 catalytic subunits can be identified in a wide range of eukaryotes, and the conservation of key catalytic motifs across organisms highlights CK2’s central role in cellular regulatory networks (borgo2021proteinkinaseck2 pages 16-17).  
Within the kinome, CK2 is distinguished by its constitutive activity, a feature that is maintained through structural constraints conserved over evolutionary time, and it is integrated into an ancient phospho-regulatory network that emerged prior to the diversification of modern eukaryotes (cozza2010howdruggableis pages 1-3).  
The evolutionary relationships among CK2 isoforms indicate that while CSNK2A1 and CSNK2A2 code for fully functional catalytic subunits, CSNK2A3 retains the hallmark catalytic domain despite its processed pseudogene status and potential involvement in oncogenic events (borgo2021proteinkinaseck2 pages 7-8).  

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
Casein kinase II catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to specific serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins, producing ADP, a phosphorylated protein and a proton (ermakova2003crystalstructureof pages 3-5).  
This reaction is central to the enzyme’s role in modulating protein function by altering substrate conformation, activity, interactions, and stability through the addition of a negatively charged phosphate group (ermakova2003crystalstructureof pages 3-5).  

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The catalytic activity of CK2, including that mediated by its alpha subunit isoforms, is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions, with Mg²⁺ serving as the primary cofactor to facilitate ATP binding and phosphoryl transfer (holland2008plasmodiumfalciparumprotein pages 35-38).  
In addition, under certain conditions, Mn²⁺ can modulate the kinase’s nucleotide preference, enabling the utilization of GTP as an alternative phosphate donor, which further distinguishes CK2 from many other kinases (holland2008plasmodiumfalciparumprotein pages 35-38).  

4. Substrate Specificity  
CK2 exhibits a pronounced substrate specificity favoring serine/threonine residues that are flanked on the C-terminal side by acidic amino acids, typically aspartate or glutamate, yielding a consensus motif that is frequently represented as S/T–X–X–D/E (stdenis2015systematicinvestigationof pages 7-8).  
This acidophilic preference is enabled by a cluster of basic residues within the substrate-binding pocket that facilitates electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged substrate residues (holland2008plasmodiumfalciparumprotein pages 35-38).  
The enzyme’s broad substrate spectrum, with over several hundred identified substrates, underscores its central role in modulating diverse cellular regulatory pathways through phosphorylation of targets containing the defined acidic motif (stdenis2015systematicinvestigationof pages 7-8).  

5. Structure  
The three-dimensional structure of CK2α is characterized by a canonical bilobal kinase fold, where the N-terminal lobe is composed predominantly of beta strands accompanied by an α-helix (αC) and the C-terminal lobe is largely helical; together, these lobes create a deep cleft that functions as the ATP-binding pocket, which is connected by a short hinge region (ermakova2003crystalstructureof pages 3-5).  
Within this structural framework, the phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) plays a critical role in anchoring the phosphate moiety of the nucleotide substrate, while the catalytic loop is responsible for orchestrating the chemical steps of the phosphoryl transfer reaction (ermakova2003crystalstructureof pages 3-5).  
A unique aspect of CK2’s structure is its constitutively active activation segment, which, unlike many other kinases that require phosphorylation for activation, is maintained in an active conformation through stabilizing contacts with the N-terminal domain (cozza2010howdruggableis pages 1-3).  
In addition, the alpha subunit contains a glycine-rich loop that supports nucleotide binding, although it deviates from the conventional structure found in many kinases by possessing a modified number of glycine residues, a feature that is implicated in its unique enzymatic properties (cozza2010howdruggableis pages 1-3).  
The regulatory beta subunit of CK2 contributes additional structural complexity; it harbors a zinc-binding motif that facilitates dimerization, and it incorporates cyclin-like domains, including putative destruction boxes and KEN boxes, which are associated with regulated protein degradation during the cell cycle (borgo2021proteinkinaseck2 pages 7-8).  
Crystal structures of CK2 derived from human and other species consistently reveal that the catalytic active sites of the alpha subunits are readily accessible even when assembled in the heterotetrameric holoenzyme, allowing both free catalytic activity and enhanced function in complex with the beta subunit (ermakova2003crystalstructureof pages 3-5, borgo2021proteinkinaseck2 pages 3-4).  
The spacious nucleotide-binding pocket accommodates both ATP and GTP due to its non-restrictive hydrogen-bonding network and sufficient solvent exposure, a structural rationale for its dual cosubstrate specificity (holland2008plasmodiumfalciparumprotein pages 35-38).  
For the CSNK2A3 gene product, although it is classified as a processed pseudogene, sequence analyses predict that its catalytic domain retains the core structural motifs necessary for kinase activity, mirroring those found in functional CK2α isoforms; however, detailed experimental structural data for the CSNK2A3 protein are still lacking (borgo2021proteinkinaseck2 pages 14-15).  
Overall, the structural organization of CK2α encompasses several conserved elements—including the N-terminal lobe, the hinge region, the catalytic loop, and the constitutively active activation segment—that together underpin its robust enzymatic activity and substrate promiscuity (ermakova2003crystalstructureof pages 3-5, cozza2010howdruggableis pages 1-3).  
The interplay between the catalytic and regulatory subunits in the holoenzyme further refines the kinetic properties of the kinase, with the regulatory beta subunit modulating both substrate specificity and overall enzymatic activity through direct interactions with the alpha subunits (borgo2021proteinkinaseck2 pages 4-6).  
AlphaFold-predicted models corroborate the experimental crystallographic findings, delineating a well-defined kinase domain with minimal structural plasticity in the activation loop, which is integrally linked to the enzyme’s constitutive activity (borgo2021proteinkinaseck2 pages 3-4).  

6. Regulation  
CK2 is characterized by an intrinsic constitutive activity; however, its function is further fine-tuned by multiple regulatory mechanisms, including both post-translational modifications (PTMs) and protein–protein interactions (roffey2021ck2regulationperspectives pages 2-4).  
Autophosphorylation events on the catalytic alpha subunits, particularly at tyrosine residues (e.g., Y182 in CK2α and Y183 in CK2α′), serve to enhance kinase activity in the absence of any external activator, although incorporation into the holoenzyme complex with the regulatory beta subunit typically modulates these phosphorylation events (roffey2021ck2regulationperspectives pages 7-8).  
Additional regulation is achieved via phosphorylation catalyzed by upstream kinases such as protein kinase C (PKC), AKT, ERK2, and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), each of which targets specific serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues within CK2α; for instance, phosphorylation at serine residues such as S194 and S277 by PKC has been shown to influence CK2 activity during cell proliferation (roffey2021ck2regulationperspectives pages 7-8).  
Acetylation of CK2α at lysine 102 is another PTM that has been reported to potentiate kinase activity, whereas modifications such as glycosylation at serine 347 and SUMOylation have been documented to attenuate activity by interfering with additional phosphorylation events and reducing protein stability (roffey2021ck2regulationperspectives pages 7-8).  
Furthermore, the dynamic assembly and disassembly of the CK2 holoenzyme, as well as alterations in the stoichiometry of its subunits, play a significant role in determining the net kinase activity observed in cells; for example, loss or reduced expression of the regulatory β subunit leads to decreased stability and altered substrate specificity of the catalytic components (borgo2021proteinkinaseck2 pages 16-17).  
Protein–protein interactions also contribute substantially to the regulation of CK2; binding partners such as fibroblast growth factors (FGF-1 and FGF-2), the tumor suppressor p21, and the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 have been shown to enhance or modulate CK2 activity by promoting its localization to specific subcellular compartments or altering its conformation (roffey2021ck2regulationperspectives pages 2-4, borgo2021proteinkinaseck2 pages 7-8).  
The subcellular localization of CK2 is tightly regulated, with the enzyme capable of shuttling between the nucleus, cytoplasm, and other organelles in response to cellular stimuli such as growth factors and stress signals, thereby enabling precise spatial and temporal control over its substrate phosphorylation (trembley2023proteinkinaseck2 pages 1-2).  

7. Function  
Casein kinase II subunit alpha 3 functions as a probable catalytic component of the constitutively active CK2 holoenzyme, which phosphorylates a broad spectrum of protein substrates that contain acidic residues adjacent to the target serine or threonine residues (cozza2016caseinkinasesas pages 17-18).  
The enzymatic activity of CK2 plays a central role in regulating diverse cellular processes, including cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation, by modulating the phosphorylation state—and thereby the function—of numerous substrates involved in signal transduction, gene expression and protein stability (trembley2023proteinkinaseck2 pages 1-2).  
Notably, CK2 is implicated in oncogenic signaling through its ability to promote cell proliferation and tumorigenesis, in part by down-regulating the expression of key tumor suppressor proteins such as PML, and elevated expression or amplification of CK2 subunit genes is frequently observed in various cancer types, including lung cancer (borgo2021proteinkinaseck2 pages 16-17, cozza2016caseinkinasesas pages 17-18).  
CK2 is further involved in multiple signaling cascades, including the PI3K/AKT/mTOR, NF-κB, JAK/STAT, and MAPK/ERK pathways, where its ongoing phosphorylation of target proteins facilitates cellular responses to growth factors and stress, thereby contributing to cell survival and resistance to apoptosis (trembley2023proteinkinaseck2 pages 1-2, roffey2021ck2regulationperspectives pages 7-8).  
In addition, the constitutive activity of CK2 suggests it functions as a “housekeeping” enzyme, maintaining baseline levels of phosphorylation necessary for proper cellular homeostasis and the regulation of numerous metabolic and transcriptional events (borgo2021proteinkinaseck2 pages 3-4).  
The tissue distribution of CK2 subunits is also of functional importance; while CK2α is broadly expressed in most tissues, CK2α′ shows a more restricted pattern, being predominantly expressed in the testis and brain, which points to isoform-specific roles in spermatogenesis and neuronal signaling (montenarh2023proteinkinaseck2α’ pages 6-8).  
Although CSNK2A3 is traditionally characterized as a pseudogene, its reported overexpression in certain human cancers such as T-cell leukemia and lung tumors, where its amplification has been linked to altered PML expression, suggests that this isoform may contribute to oncogenic processes by acting in an amplification-dependent manner (borgo2021proteinkinaseck2 pages 14-15).  

8. Other Comments  
Several selective inhibitors have been developed to target the catalytic activity of CK2, and among these, the ATP-competitive inhibitor CX-4945 (Silmitasertib) has emerged as one of the most clinically advanced molecules, demonstrating potent antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in a variety of cancer models (cozza2016caseinkinasesas pages 20-21, roffey2021ck2regulationperspectives pages 7-8).  
In addition to small molecule inhibitors, peptide-based compounds such as CIGB-300 have been shown to disrupt CK2 holoenzyme assembly, thereby modulating downstream phosphorylation events and exhibiting antitumor activity in preclinical studies (borgo2021proteinkinaseck2 pages 7-8).  
The amplification-dependent oncogenic properties attributed to CSNK2A3, as evidenced by its proposed role in promoting cell proliferation and tumorigenesis through the down-regulation of the tumor suppressor protein PML, further underline its potential significance as a therapeutic target in lung cancer and possibly other malignancies (borgo2021proteinkinaseck2 pages 16-17).  
Although CSNK2A3 is classified as a pseudogene, emerging evidence from expression studies in human cancer tissues indicates that it may be transcriptionally active in certain contexts and could impact the overall activity of the CK2 holoenzyme, thus representing an additional layer of complexity in the regulation of CK2-mediated signaling pathways (borgo2021proteinkinaseck2 pages 14-15).  
Given the extensive range of substrates that CK2 phosphorylates and its involvement in critical cellular processes, ongoing efforts continue to optimize the selectivity and potency of CK2 inhibitors, with the aim of achieving therapeutic modulation of this enzyme in cancer and other diseases where dysregulated phosphorylation is a hallmark (cesaro2023exploringproteinkinase pages 1-2, roffey2021ck2regulationperspectives pages 7-8).  
The integration of structural, biochemical, and pharmacological data continues to refine our understanding of CK2 regulation; however, further studies are warranted to determine the precise functional contributions of isoforms such as CSNK2A3 in both normal physiology and disease states (montenarh2023proteinkinaseck2α’ pages 8-9).
