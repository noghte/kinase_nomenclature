1. Phylogeny  
EPHA4 is a member of the Eph receptor family, which represents the largest group of receptor tyrosine kinases in vertebrates. It is classified within the EphA subfamily, a group characterized by an extracellular domain that is adapted to bind glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored ephrin-A ligands. Unlike most of its EphA counterparts, EPHA4 exhibits the unique property of binding not only GPI‐anchored ephrin-A ligands but also transmembrane ephrin-B ligands, such as EFNB3, thus distinguishing it within the family (miyazaki2013epha4isa pages 6-7). Orthologs of EPHA4 are present in a wide range of vertebrate species, and its sequence conservation is evident in the extracellular ligand-binding module as well as in the intracellular catalytic domain, implying that its fundamental role in mediating cell–cell communication and axonal guidance has been retained through evolution (eberhart2000expressionofepha4 pages 7-8, beg2007α2chimaerinisan pages 1-2). Phylogenetic analyses, based on conserved sequence motifs found in both the ligand-binding and kinase domains, support the conclusion that EPHA4 and other EphA receptors share a common ancestor that can be traced back to early vertebrate evolution, and highlight its close evolutionary relationship with other receptors that participate in developmental and cell adhesion processes (qin2008crystalstructureand pages 2-2, saintigny2012globalevaluationof pages 8-9).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
EPHA4 functions as a receptor tyrosine kinase that catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to specific tyrosine residues on substrate proteins. The canonical reaction can be formulated as follows: ATP + protein‑L‑tyrosine → ADP + protein‑L‑tyrosine‑phosphate + H⁺, which is typical for enzymes in the receptor tyrosine kinase family (beg2007α2chimaerinisan pages 9-10).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The kinase activity of EPHA4 is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions. In particular, Mg²⁺ serves as an essential cofactor that facilitates the binding of ATP in the active site, which is required for the phosphorylation reaction (qin2008crystalstructureand pages 1-2).

4. Substrate Specificity  
EPHA4 exhibits substrate specificity characteristic of tyrosine kinases, phosphorylating tyrosine residues on target proteins. The receptor’s specificity is defined by the recognition of consensus sequence motifs that include a target tyrosine flanked by specific amino acid residues; although the precise consensus motif is not fully delineated in the available literature, its functional interactions suggest a preference for motifs that support binding of downstream effectors such as the Rac GTPase-activating protein, a2‑chimaerin (beg2007α2chimaerinisan pages 2-3). In addition, EPHA4 phosphorylates substrates involved in integrin-dependent signaling pathways, where key targets include proteins that regulate the activity of the Rho, Rac, and Rap GTPases, thereby modulating cytoskeletal dynamics and cell adhesion (bourgin2007theepha4receptor pages 3-5).

5. Structure  
EPHA4 is organized in a modular fashion, beginning with an N‑terminal extracellular region that encompasses a ligand‑binding domain with a jellyroll β‑sandwich fold. This domain is characterized by flexible loop regions—most notably the D–E and J–K loops—that form a high‑affinity ephrin‑binding channel and determine ligand specificity (qin2008crystalstructureand pages 10-11, qin2008crystalstructureand pages 4-6). Following the extracellular domain is a single transmembrane helix that anchors the receptor to the plasma membrane. The intracellular region comprises a catalytic tyrosine kinase domain that contains an activation loop and a C‑helix, key features required for proper catalytic function. Crystallographic and NMR studies have revealed that the kinase domain of EPHA4 adopts the typical bilobal structure found in tyrosine kinases, with the small N‑lobe primarily binding ATP and the larger C‑lobe coordinating substrate recognition and catalysis (bourgin2007theepha4receptor pages 1-2, beg2007α2chimaerinisan pages 9-10). Moreover, structural investigations have identified specific residues within the extracellular domain, such as Ile31, Met32 in the D–E loop and Ile131 with Gly132 in the J–K loop, that are critical for binding small molecule antagonists; these studies highlight the potential for therapeutic targeting through inhibition of the ephrin‑binding channel (qin2008crystalstructureand pages 9-10).

6. Regulation  
EPHA4 is regulated by a number of post‑translational and ligand‑dependent events that finely tune its signaling output. The receptor becomes activated upon binding to membrane‑bound ephrin ligands, which induces receptor clustering and subsequent autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues within its cytoplasmic domain. This autophosphorylation event is essential for recruiting intracellular signaling partners and effectors such as a2‑chimaerin, which interacts with EPHA4 through its SH2 domain; such interactions are dependent on the phosphorylated state of EPHA4’s juxtamembrane region (beg2007α2chimaerinisan pages 2-3, beg2007α2chimaerinisan pages 6-8). In addition to ligand‑induced autophosphorylation, EPHA4 is subject to proteolytic regulation. In hippocampal neurons, EPHA4 undergoes ectodomain shedding by matrix metalloproteases, followed by γ‑secretase‑mediated cleavage of the remaining C‑terminal fragment; the generation of the intracellular domain via this sequential proteolysis is associated with the modulation of dendritic spine morphogenesis (inoue2009synapticactivityprompts pages 5-6). Furthermore, EPHA4 signaling is modulated by its interaction with the anaphase‑promoting complex (APC) in association with Cdh1, which facilitates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of downstream substrates, including the AMPA receptor subunit GluR1; this regulatory mechanism plays a role in maintaining homeostatic synaptic plasticity (fu2011apccdh1mediatesepha4dependent pages 7-8). Phosphorylation by Src family kinases is also crucial for the transcription of the conformational state that allows EPHA4 to recruit intracellular effectors and to propagate its signaling cascade (shi2007α2chimaerininteractswith pages 3-4). Collectively, these modifications and interactions ensure that EPHA4 activity is precisely regulated in both a spatial and temporal manner.

7. Function  
EPHA4 serves as a critical mediator of contact‑dependent bidirectional signaling between adjacent cells. Upon binding to ephrin ligands presented on the surface of neighboring cells, EPHA4 undergoes receptor clustering and autophosphorylation, thereby initiating “forward signaling” in the receptor‑expressing cell while simultaneously triggering “reverse signaling” in the ligand‑expressing cell. In the nervous system, EPHA4 is essential for multiple developmental processes including axonal guidance, the establishment of corticospinal projections, and the segregation of motor and sensory axons during neuromuscular circuit formation (beg2007α2chimaerinisan pages 1-2, eberhart2004ephrina5exertspositive pages 1-2). EPHA4 regulates cell morphology and integrin‑dependent adhesion by modulating the activity of small GTPases such as Rho, Rac, and Rap. Through interactions with downstream effectors including a2‑chimaerin and ephexin1, EPHA4 influences the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, thereby controlling growth cone collapse and ensuring proper axon pathfinding (beg2007α2chimaerinisan pages 6-8, bourgin2007theepha4receptor pages 3-5). In addition to its roles in axon guidance, EPHA4 contributes to synaptic plasticity by regulating dendritic spine morphogenesis and neurotransmitter receptor trafficking, processes that are critical in the modulation of synaptic strength and long‑term potentiation. This function is underscored by the γ‑secretase–mediated release of the EPHA4 intracellular domain, which has been linked to the formation of new dendritic spines in hippocampal neurons (inoue2009synapticactivityprompts pages 5-6, fu2011apccdh1mediatesepha4dependent pages 1-2). Moreover, EPHA4 is involved in neuron‑glia communication; its interaction with astrocyte‑expressed ephrin‑A3 modulates the expression and function of glial glutamate transporters, thereby influencing synaptic glutamate clearance and excitatory neurotransmission (filosa2009neurongliacommunicationvia pages 2-4, filosa2009neurongliacommunicationvia pages 9-14). Outside the nervous system, EPHA4 participates in vascular development by engaging in signaling pathways that regulate vascular smooth muscle contraction and endothelial cell behavior, as evidenced by its role in the activation of RhoA through association with vascular smooth muscle‑specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (ogita2003epha4mediatedrhoactivation pages 1-2, ogita2003epha4mediatedrhoactivation pages 4-5). In pathological conditions, EPHA4 has been implicated in inhibiting axonal regeneration following spinal cord injury and in mediating motor neuron death in motor neuron disease models; it is also associated with changes in cell migration and invasion in certain types of cancer, where elevated EPHA4 expression correlates with improved clinical outcomes in lung adenocarcinoma (goldshmit2011epha4blockerspromote pages 12-12, zhao2021roleofepha4 pages 1-2, saintigny2012globalevaluationof pages 5-6). Thus, EPHA4 functions as a multifaceted regulator of cell signaling that integrates extracellular contact cues with intracellular pathways governing cellular adhesion, morphology, and survival.

8. Other Comments  
A number of experimental inhibitors and modulators have been identified that target EPHA4 and its associated signaling pathways. These include recombinant EPHA4‑Fc fusion proteins and small peptides such as the 12‑amino acid KYL peptide, which interfere with ephrin ligand binding by occupying the high‑affinity ephrin‑binding channel of EPHA4 (fu2014blockadeofepha4 pages 5-5, fu2014blockadeofepha4 pages 6-6). Small molecule antagonists, including compounds identified through virtual screening approaches, have also been reported to bind within this channel with moderate affinity, thereby offering potential avenues for therapeutic intervention (qin2008crystalstructureand pages 9-10). EPHA4 is associated with several disease states; in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, overactivation of EPHA4 has been linked to synaptic dysfunction, dendritic spine loss, and impaired long‑term potentiation, which collectively contribute to cognitive decline (fu2014blockadeofepha4 pages 1-1, fu2014blockadeofepha4 pages 2-4). In the context of motor neuron disease, EPHA4 signaling has been implicated in promoting motor neuron death, and experimental reduction of EPHA4 levels in motor neurons has been shown to improve motor function and increase neuron survival (zhao2021roleofepha4 pages 1-2, zhao2021roleofepha4 pages 10-12). In models of spinal cord injury, blockade of EPHA4 signaling facilitates axonal regeneration and enhances functional recovery, thereby underscoring its role as a negative regulator of neural repair (goldshmit2011epha4blockerspromote pages 12-12). Although specific disease-associated mutations in EPHA4 have not been extensively characterized in the literature provided, altered expression and dysregulation of EPHA4 signaling have been observed in pathological conditions including various cancers, where its expression appears to inhibit cell migration and invasion (saintigny2012globalevaluationof pages 5-6, miyazaki2013epha4isa pages 6-7). Given its broad ligand‑binding promiscuity and central role in multiple signaling cascades, EPHA4 remains an attractive target for therapeutic development in a range of clinical contexts.
