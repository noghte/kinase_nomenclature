1. Phylogeny  
EPHA8 is a member of the Eph receptor tyrosine kinase family and is classified within the EphA subfamily, which comprises nine mammalian receptors sharing conserved extracellular and intracellular domains (arcas2020theevolutionaryhistory pages 1-2, katoh2006comparativeintegromicson pages 1-2). Orthologs of EPHA8 have been identified in a range of vertebrate species, and its domain organization—including an extracellular ligand‐binding region, cysteine‐rich domain, fibronectin type III repeats, transmembrane helix, juxtamembrane region, and an intracellular kinase domain—is highly conserved (gu2001theepha8receptor pages 1-2, katoh2006comparativeintegromicson pages 1-2). Phylogenetic analyses indicate that EPHA8 is most closely related to other EphA receptors such as EPHA7 and EPHA10, reflecting an evolutionary trajectory that dates back to early metazoan ancestors, with gene duplication events having contributed to the diversification of this receptor family (arcas2020theevolutionaryhistory pages 6-7, banerjee2021identificationdenouvelles pages 21-25).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
EPHA8 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to specific tyrosine residues on substrate proteins, a reaction that underlies its role as a receptor tyrosine kinase (gu2001theepha8receptor pages 1-2, gu2001theepha8receptor pages 17-18). This reaction can be formally represented as:  
  ATP + [protein]-tyrosine → ADP + [protein]-phosphotyrosine + H⁺  
such that the autophosphorylation of EPHA8, as well as phosphorylation of intracellular targets, creates docking sites for proteins with SH2 or PTB domains (gu2001theepha8receptor pages 18-19, bush2022cellularandmolecular pages 1-4).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The kinase activity of EPHA8 is dependent on divalent cations, with Mg²⁺ being required to facilitate the binding and proper positioning of ATP within the active site (gu2001theepha8receptor pages 1-2, arcas2020theevolutionaryhistory pages 2-3). This cofactor dependency is a hallmark of receptor tyrosine kinases and is essential for efficient phosphotransferase activity (gu2001theepha8receptor pages 2-3, bush2022cellularandmolecular pages 1-4).

4. Substrate Specificity  
EPHA8 exhibits specificity for tyrosine residues present in both its own intracellular domain and in downstream signaling substrates. Autophosphorylation of conserved tyrosine sites—predominantly located within the juxtamembrane and activation loop regions—creates binding sites for adaptor proteins that contain SH2 or PTB domains, such as Odin and AIDA-1b (gu2001theepha8receptor pages 17-18, shin2007identificationofphosphotyrosine pages 10-12). Although a definitive consensus substrate motif for EPHA8 has not been explicitly reported in the available literature, the phosphorylated tyrosine residues function as critical docking sites for mediators of downstream signaling cascades (gu2001theepha8receptor pages 18-19, shin2007identificationofphosphotyrosine pages 2-2).

5. Structure  
EPHA8 is organized into multiple domains that each contribute to its function as a receptor tyrosine kinase. Its extracellular region comprises an N-terminal ligand-binding (immunoglobulin-like) domain that mediates interactions with GPI-anchored ephrin-A ligands, followed by a cysteine-rich domain and two fibronectin type III repeats that play roles in ligand specificity and receptor dimerization (katoh2006comparativeintegromicson pages 1-2, gu2001theepha8receptor pages 1-2). A single transmembrane helix anchors the receptor to the plasma membrane and connects the extracellular portion to an intracellular region. This intracellular segment includes a juxtamembrane (JM) domain that is critical for the regulation of kinase activity and serves as a binding platform for adaptor proteins such as Odin (gu2001theepha8receptor pages 2-3, shin2007identificationofphosphotyrosine pages 2-3). Following the JM domain is the tyrosine kinase domain, which adopts a typical bilobal kinase fold with a conserved ATP-binding site, activation loop, and hydrophobic spines that are essential for catalysis; in this domain, structural elements undergo conformational changes upon ligand-induced receptor dimerization (gu2001theepha8receptor pages 3-4, bush2022cellularandmolecular pages 1-4). In addition, EPHA8 contains a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain in its C-terminal region, which is implicated in protein–protein interactions and may contribute to receptor oligomerization and downstream signaling regulation (gu2001theepha8receptor pages 13-15, shin2007identificationofphosphotyrosine pages 3-5). Structural models, including those derived from AlphaFold, indicate that the catalytic region conforms to the classical features of receptor tyrosine kinases, integrating the activation loop and C-helix for regulation of activity (bush2022cellularandmolecular pages 1-4, gu2001theepha8receptor pages 17-18).

6. Regulation  
EPHA8 activity is regulated through a combination of ligand-dependent and ligand-independent mechanisms. Binding of GPI-anchored ephrin-A ligands (notably EFNA2, EFNA3, and EFNA5) induces receptor clustering and conformational changes that promote autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues within the JM and activation loop regions, thereby initiating forward signaling (OpenTargets Search: -EPHA8, arcas2020theevolutionaryhistory pages 1-2). Phosphorylation creates specific docking sites for intracellular adaptor proteins—such as FYN, which contributes to cell adhesion, and Odin and AIDA-1b, which bind via their PTB domains to specific motifs in the JM region—thus propagating downstream signaling events (shin2007identificationofphosphotyrosine pages 10-12, gu2001theepha8receptor pages 17-18). In addition, EPHA8 modulates integrin-mediated cell adhesion through a pathway that involves the recruitment and stabilization of the p110γ subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K); this regulatory function can occur independently of EPHA8’s intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and is mediated by the JM domain (gu2001theepha8receptor pages 17-18, banerjee2021identificationdenouvelles pages 42-44). Ligand-induced receptor clustering further facilitates allosteric interactions within the kinase domain that enhance catalytic activity, while conformational changes in the SAM domain may affect receptor dimerization and subsequent signaling outcomes (bush2022cellularandmolecular pages 6-9, shin2007identificationofphosphotyrosine pages 2-3).

7. Function  
EPHA8 functions as a receptor tyrosine kinase that mediates contact‐dependent bidirectional signaling between adjacent cells. Upon binding to GPI-anchored ephrin-A ligands on neighboring cells, EPHA8 undergoes ligand-dependent autophosphorylation, triggering forward signaling cascades that regulate cell adhesion, migration, and axon guidance (OpenTargets Search: -EPHA8, gu2001theepha8receptor pages 1-2). In the developing nervous system, EPHA8 contributes to axonal pathfinding and neurite outgrowth by modulating intracellular pathways that involve MAP kinases and the Src family kinase FYN, leading to changes in cytoskeletal organization (banerjee2021identificationdenouvelles pages 47-50, bush2022cellularandmolecular pages 1-4). In addition, EPHA8 regulates integrin-mediated cell adhesion on fibronectin substrates via a PI3K-dependent mechanism that can occur independently of its kinase activity; this aspect of EPHA8 function is critical for controlling cell migration and the dynamic formation of tissue boundaries (gu2001theepha8receptor pages 17-18, banerjee2021identificationdenouvelles pages 52-53). The receptor is expressed in specific neuronal populations during embryogenesis, where its signaling influences the formation of neural circuits and proper wiring of the nervous system through effects on growth cone collapse and cell segregation (gu2001theepha8receptor pages 1-2, shin2007identificationofphosphotyrosine pages 8-10).

8. Other Comments  
EPHA8 has been implicated in several pathological conditions, most notably in thyroid cancer and related neoplasms, as highlighted by disease association data from the Open Targets Platform (OpenTargets Search: -EPHA8). The receptor’s ability to modulate integrin-mediated adhesion and migration, as well as its role in axon guidance, underscores its potential involvement in tumor progression and metastasis when its signaling is dysregulated (arcas2020theevolutionaryhistory pages 6-7, banerjee2021identificationdenouvelles pages 192-193). Pharmacologically, small molecule inhibitors such as Vandetanib—which targets Eph receptors among other kinases—have been employed in clinical settings to interfere with Eph-related signaling pathways, providing a therapeutic avenue for cancers in which EPHA8 may play a contributory role (OpenTargets Search: -EPHA8, bush2022cellularandmolecular pages 9-12). In experimental studies, inhibitors such as wortmannin have been used to block PI3K activity downstream of EPHA8, thereby elucidating the kinase-independent pathway that regulates integrin activation (gu2001theepha8receptor pages 17-18, banerjee2021identificationdenouvelles pages 56-58).
