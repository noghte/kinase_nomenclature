1. Phylogeny  
Ethanolamine kinase 1 (ETNK1, also designated EKI1) is a member of the choline/ethanolamine kinase family, an evolutionarily conserved group of enzymes that participate in the Kennedy pathway for phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis. Orthologs of ETNK1 are found across a broad range of eukaryotic species including mammals, yeast, plants, and even some parasitic organisms, indicating conservation of its central metabolic role (gibellini2010thekennedypathway—de pages 12-13, bakovic2007metabolicandmolecular pages 5-6). Despite its structural similarity to the choline kinases, ETNK1 is functionally distinct; its catalytic domain harbors conserved motifs that have been refined through evolution to ensure specificity for ethanolamine over choline (alberge2010comparisonofthe pages 9-12).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
ETNK1 catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of ethanolamine, converting ethanolamine and ATP into phosphoethanolamine, ADP, and a proton. In chemical notation, the reaction can be written as:  
ATP + ethanolamine → ADP + phosphoethanolamine + H⁺  
This reaction is the first step of the Kennedy pathway and is considered to be a rate-controlling step in the de novo synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine (fontana2020etnk1mutationsinduce pages 1-2, gibellini2010thekennedypathway—de pages 1-3).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The catalytic activity of ETNK1 is dependent on the presence of ATP, which serves as a phosphate donor, and a divalent metal ion cofactor, most notably Mg²⁺, which is essential for the phosphoryl-transfer reaction. These cofactors facilitate proper substrate orientation and stabilize the transition state during catalysis (bakovic2007metabolicandmolecular pages 2-4, gibellini2010thekennedypathway—de pages 4-6).

4. Substrate Specificity  
ETNK1 is highly specific for ethanolamine, exhibiting a strong preference for this substrate while displaying negligible activity toward choline. This specificity is evident from biochemical assays in which ethanolamine is efficiently phosphorylated to phosphoethanolamine, whereas choline phosphorylation is not observed under similar conditions. The enzyme’s substrate selectivity is critical for its role in directing flux through the phosphatidylethanolamine branch of the Kennedy pathway (fontana2020etnk1mutationsinduce pages 1-2, shah2018molecularcausesof pages 1-3, gibellini2010thekennedypathway—de pages 1-3).

5. Structure  
ETNK1 is predicted to possess a central catalytic domain that is characteristic of the choline/ethanolamine kinase family. This domain contains conserved structural elements, including the Brenner’s phosphotransferase motif and a consensus sequence associated with choline/ethanolamine kinases. Mutational analyses have revealed that residues within a narrow region of the catalytic domain—specifically histidine 243, asparagine 244, and glycine 245—are critical for enzymatic activity; somatic mutations at these positions diminish activity and lower intracellular phosphoethanolamine levels (fontana2020etnk1mutationsinduce pages 3-4, fontana2020etnk1mutationsinduce pages 10-11). In addition, structural comparisons based on AlphaFold predictions and crystallographic models from homologous enzymes indicate that the catalytic domain is organized into a nucleotide‐binding pocket and a substrate‐binding site; the overall fold is reminiscent of a kinase core consisting of a series of β‐strands and α‐helices that form a compact structure (gibellini2010thekennedypathway—de pages 4-6, alberge2010comparisonofthe pages 25-29, pei2023computationalanalysisof pages 14-15). Some related ethanolamine kinases from parasites have been observed to exist as dimers, suggesting that oligomerization might contribute to catalytic efficiency and regulation; although direct experimental evidence for ETNK1 dimerization in mammals is limited, similar structural features are anticipated (alberge2010comparisonofthe pages 9-12).

6. Regulation  
Regulatory mechanisms impacting ETNK1 activity have been derived from studies of somatic mutations in its catalytic domain. For example, mutations such as N244S and H243Y impair the enzyme’s ability to generate phosphoethanolamine, resulting in lower intracellular levels of the product and subsequent mitochondrial hyperactivation with elevated reactive oxygen species formation (fontana2020etnk1mutationsinduce pages 2-3, fontana2020etnk1mutationsinduce pages 3-4). The reversal of the mutator phenotype by administering exogenous phosphoethanolamine indicates that the enzyme’s product plays a role in feedback regulation of mitochondrial function (fontana2020etnk1mutationsinduce pages 2-3). In addition, transcriptome analyses comparing wild-type and mutant ETNK1 cells have revealed only minimal changes in gene expression unrelated to lipid biosynthesis, suggesting that ETNK1 is primarily regulated at the enzymatic level rather than through extensive transcriptional control (fontana2020etnk1mutationsinduce pages 3-4).

7. Function  
ETNK1 functions as the initiating enzyme in the Kennedy pathway by catalyzing the phosphorylation of ethanolamine to form phosphoethanolamine, which is an essential precursor for the synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). PE is a major phospholipid that plays a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity of cellular membranes, contributing to membrane curvature and fluidity, and supporting mitochondrial function and energy production (fontana2020etnk1mutationsinduce pages 1-2, bakovic2007metabolicandmolecular pages 5-6). In hematopoietic cells, ETNK1 activity is critical for balancing phospholipid composition and preserving genome stability; mutations in ETNK1 have been identified in a range of hematological malignancies, including atypical chronic myeloid leukemia, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, systemic mastocytosis, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (fontana2020etnk1mutationsinduce pages 10-11, fontana2020etnk1mutationsinduce pages 11-12). The precise regulation of mitochondrial activity by phosphoethanolamine—via competitive inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase (complex II)—further emphasizes the enzyme’s role in coupling membrane lipid synthesis to cellular energy metabolism (fontana2020etnk1mutationsinduce pages 10-11, gibellini2010thekennedypathway—de pages 1-3).

8. Other Comments  
Exogenous phosphoethanolamine supplementation has been shown to reverse the mitochondrial hyperactivation and increased reactive oxygen species observed in cells harboring ETNK1 mutations, highlighting the potential therapeutic value of modulating phosphoethanolamine levels in diseases linked to ETNK1 dysfunction (fontana2020etnk1mutationsinduce pages 3-4). Although no specific small-molecule inhibitors targeting ETNK1 have been definitively characterized to date, research into related kinase inhibitors and modulation of the Kennedy pathway suggests that further exploration of ETNK1 as a therapeutic target in hematological malignancies may be warranted (fontana2020etnk1mutationsinduce pages 3-4, shah2018molecularcausesof pages 1-3). The enzyme’s high substrate specificity for ethanolamine distinguishes it from other kinases such as choline kinases, which have broader substrate profiles and play divergent roles in lipid metabolism; this specificity underpins its designation as a rate-controlling step in phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis (gibellini2010thekennedypathway—de pages 1-3, shah2018molecularcausesof pages 1-3).
