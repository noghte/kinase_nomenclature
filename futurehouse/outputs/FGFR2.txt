1. Phylogeny – FGFR2, encoded by the FGFR2 gene and alternatively known as BEK, KGFR, or K-sam, is a member of the fibroblast growth factor receptor family, a well‐conserved sub‐group of receptor tyrosine kinases present from fish to mammals (ornitz2015thefibroblastgrowth pages 2-4).  
Orthologs of FGFR2 have been identified in a broad spectrum of vertebrate species, underscoring its essential role in regulating developmental processes across evolution (beenken2009thefgffamily pages 1-2).  
Phylogenetic analyses reveal that the FGFR family arose through early gene duplication events in vertebrate evolution, giving rise to the four human receptors FGFR1–FGFR4 that share a common structural framework (belov2013molecularmechanismsof pages 1-2).  
The high degree of conservation in the extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, the single transmembrane helix, and the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain indicates that FGFR2 has maintained its critical signaling function over millions of years (lei2017fibroblastgrowthfactor pages 7-7).  
Alternative splicing within the third immunoglobulin-like domain of FGFR2 generates distinct isoforms, such as FGFR2-IIIb and FGFR2-IIIc, which display different ligand binding preferences and tissue-specific expression patterns, reflecting an evolutionary solution to diversify signaling outputs (ornitz2015thefibroblastgrowth pages 27-29).  
These splicing events serve as an adaptive mechanism to regulate receptor function in different cellular contexts and are highly conserved among mammals (chioni2021biologicalsignificanceand pages 1-2).  
Within the human kinome, FGFR2 belongs to the receptor tyrosine kinase clan, and its sequence similarities with other members of the FGFR subfamily confirm its placement in a critical evolutionary and functional lineage (roskoski2020theroleof pages 1-7).  
Furthermore, comparative genomic studies highlight that the diversification of FGFRs, including FGFR2, has enabled the fine-tuning of responses to fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), which is central to embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis (beenken2009thefgffamily pages 4-6).

2. Reaction Catalyzed – FGFR2 functions as a receptor tyrosine kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues on target proteins using ATP as a phosphate donor (dai2019fibroblastgrowthfactor pages 1-4).  
The catalytic reaction can be represented by the equation: ATP + [protein]-Tyr → ADP + [protein]-phosphotyrosine + H⁺, with FGFR2 mediating the transfer of the phosphate group to either itself (autophosphorylation) or downstream substrates (roskoski2020theroleof pages 7-11).  
Autophosphorylation of FGFR2 on key tyrosine residues within its activation loop serves as a pivotal step in receptor activation and is required for the subsequent assembly of signaling complexes (beenken2009thefgffamily pages 22-23).  
This phosphorylation event initiates multiple downstream signaling pathways by creating docking sites for adaptor proteins, thereby propagating signals that regulate proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (farrell2018structureactivationand pages 8-10).

3. Cofactor Requirements – The kinase activity of FGFR2 is strictly dependent on the binding of ATP in the catalytic pocket of the kinase domain (roskoski2020theroleof pages 11-15).  
In addition to ATP, divalent metal ions—most notably Mg²⁺—serve as essential cofactors by coordinating ATP and facilitating efficient phosphotransfer during the catalytic reaction (farrell2018structureactivationand pages 8-10).

4. Substrate Specificity – FGFR2 exhibits a high degree of substrate specificity for tyrosine residues present on both the receptor itself and on several downstream signaling proteins (beenken2009thefgffamily pages 22-23).  
The receptor’s kinase domain is configured to recognize specific sequence contexts within substrate proteins, directing phosphorylation events predominantly to tyrosine residues located within particular motifs that are critical for signal propagation (farrell2018structureactivationand pages 16-17).  
This specificity is exemplified by FGFR2’s ability to phosphorylate adapter proteins such as FRS2, which in turn recruits GRB2, GAB1, and SOS1 to engage the Ras-MAPK cascade, as well as PLCγ1, which leads to the generation of second messengers like diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (chioni2021biologicalsignificanceand pages 19-21).

5. Structure – FGFR2 is organized into three distinct regions: an extracellular domain, a single transmembrane segment, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain (beenken2009thefgffamily pages 4-6).  
The extracellular region comprises three immunoglobulin-like domains (designated D1, D2, and D3), with the first domain (D1) and the intervening acidic box serving as autoinhibitory elements that modulate ligand binding (ornitz2015thefibroblastgrowth pages 2-4).  
Alternative splicing in the D3 domain yields isoforms such as FGFR2-IIIb, which is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues, and FGFR2-IIIc, which is more commonly found in mesenchymal cells; these splice variants determine ligand preference and tissue specificity (beenken2009thefgffamily pages 35-39).  
The transmembrane domain anchors FGFR2 within the plasma membrane and facilitates receptor dimerization upon FGF binding, which is critical for activation of its cytoplasmic kinase activity (teven2014fibroblastgrowthfactor pages 1-2).  
Internally, the tyrosine kinase domain is characterized by a bilobed structure that includes an N-terminal lobe, which contains a glycine-rich loop important for ATP binding, and a larger C-terminal lobe that houses the catalytic loop, activation segment, and a conserved DFG motif necessary for enzymatic activity (farrell2018structureactivationand pages 8-10).  
Key catalytic features such as the αC-helix, hydrophobic spines, and regulatory segments contribute to maintaining the delicate balance between the active and inactive conformations of the receptor (roskoski2020theroleof pages 15-19).  
Recent structural studies utilizing crystallography and advanced prediction methods such as AlphaFold have provided further insights into conformational changes that occur upon ligand binding and autophosphorylation, revealing details of the molecular interactions that govern FGFR2 activation and inhibitor binding (dai2019fibroblastgrowthfactor pages 4-5).

6. Regulation – FGFR2 activity is tightly regulated through multiple mechanisms that ensure proper signal intensity and duration (beenken2009thefgffamily pages 4-6).  
Ligand binding by fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), in conjunction with heparan sulfate proteoglycans, induces receptor dimerization, which is a prerequisite for trans-autophosphorylation and full activation of the intracellular kinase domain (beenken2009thefgffamily pages 40-42).  
Autophosphorylation on key tyrosine residues within the activation loop, such as those analogous to Y653 and Y654, stabilizes the active conformation of the kinase domain and creates binding sites for downstream adaptor proteins (roskoski2020theroleof pages 7-11).  
Negative regulatory proteins, including members of the Sprouty family and SEF, attenuate FGFR2 signaling by interfering with the Ras-MAPK cascade and by blocking further receptor activation (chioni2021biologicalsignificanceand pages 17-18).  
In addition, alternative splicing of FGFR2 generates isoforms with distinct binding affinities for FGFs, thus contributing an additional regulatory layer that tailors the receptor’s signaling output to the specific needs of different tissues (ornitz2015thefibroblastgrowth pages 27-29).  
Receptor internalization through clathrin-mediated endocytosis followed by ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation also serves as an important mechanism to terminate FGFR2 signaling after ligand stimulation (roskoski2020theroleof pages 43-47).

7. Function – FGFR2 is a multifunctional receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a central role in mediating a wide range of cellular processes (beenken2009thefgffamily pages 22-23).  
It is integral to embryonic development by controlling cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, and it is essential for proper embryonic patterning, limb bud development, and lung morphogenesis (beenken2009thefgffamily pages 22-23).  
In skeletal tissues, FGFR2 promotes cell proliferation in keratinocytes and immature osteoblasts while simultaneously facilitating apoptosis in differentiated osteoblasts, thereby regulating bone formation and ossification (teven2014fibroblastgrowthfactor pages 9-10).  
Upon ligand engagement, FGFR2 phosphorylates a range of downstream substrates—including phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1), FGFR substrate 2 (FRS2), and p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4)—which leads to the activation of key signaling pathways such as the Ras-MAPK and PI3K-Akt cascades (beenken2009thefgffamily pages 22-23).  
These phosphorylation events result in the generation of second messengers such as diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, which are critical for propagating cellular responses that control proliferation, migration, and differentiation (chioni2021biologicalsignificanceand pages 19-21).  
FGFR2 expression is observed in numerous tissues including the skin, bone, and lung, where its spatial and temporal regulation is vital for normal tissue homeostasis and repair (ornitz2015thefibroblastgrowth pages 5-6).  
Aberrant FGFR2 signaling, whether due to mutations, alternative splicing anomalies, or overexpression, has been linked to a range of pathological conditions such as craniosynostosis syndromes, other skeletal dysplasias, and a variety of cancers including endometrial and bladder carcinomas (roskoski2020theroleof pages 87-91).

8. Other Comments – Owing to its critical roles in development and disease, FGFR2 has become a major focus of therapeutic research and drug discovery (beenken2009thefgffamily pages 42-42).  
Several small-molecule inhibitors, including PD173074 and SU5402, have been employed in preclinical studies to block FGFR2 kinase activity and thereby attenuate aberrant signaling in cancer models (teven2014fibroblastgrowthfactor pages 9-10).  
More recently, clinical candidates such as AZD4547, Debio-1347, Erdafitinib, and rogaratinib have been developed to target FGFR2 and related family members in tumors characterized by FGFR2 amplifications, mutations, or gene fusions (roskoski2020theroleof pages 43-47).  
In addition to pharmacological inhibitors, therapeutic approaches leveraging monoclonal antibodies against FGFR2 are under investigation, highlighting the receptor’s potential as a biomarker and treatment target in oncology (chioni2021biologicalsignificanceand pages 19-21).  
Mutations in FGFR2 that result in constitutive activation have been implicated in developmental disorders such as craniosynostosis syndromes, further emphasizing the importance of tightly regulated FGFR2 signaling in normal tissue development (teven2014fibroblastgrowthfactor pages 9-10).  
Moreover, research continues to explore the receptor’s roles in tissue repair and regeneration, as modulation of FGFR2 activity may enhance wound healing and epithelial repair in damaged tissues (teven2014fibroblastgrowthfactor pages 1-2).  
Ongoing studies aimed at elucidating the detailed molecular interactions and regulatory mechanisms of FGFR2 are expected to pave the way for the development of next-generation therapeutics with improved specificity and clinical efficacy (farrell2018structureactivationand pages 15-16).
