1. Phylogeny  
Rhodopsin kinase (GRK1), also designated as G protein‐coupled receptor kinase 1, is a member of the AGC kinase superfamily that traces its evolutionary origin to the common ancestral kinases present across eukaryotes (benovic2021historicalperspectiveof pages 4-6). Its orthologs have been identified in all vertebrate species, where GRK1 is predominantly associated with photoreceptor cells, and phylogenetic analyses consistently group it within the visual GRK subfamily together with GRK7 (gurevich2012gproteincoupledreceptor pages 20-21). Comparative sequence analyses reveal that GRK1 retains conserved structural motifs, including the short N-terminal element and catalytic residues, which underscore its specialization for phosphorylating activated photopigments such as rhodopsin (gurevich2012gproteincoupledreceptor pages 21-23). This evolutionary conservation is indicative of its critical role in visual signal modulation and places GRK1 as the prototypical kinase among the GRK family members regulating GPCR desensitization (gurevich2012gproteincoupledreceptor pages 4-5).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
GRK1 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to specific serine/threonine residues on activated rhodopsin, converting ATP into ADP while producing phosphorylated rhodopsin and releasing a proton (chen2021structuresofrhodopsin pages 1-2). This reaction initiates the desensitization process of the photoreceptor by creating a binding platform for arrestin, thereby terminating further G protein signaling.

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The kinase activity of GRK1 is dependent on Mg²⁺ ions, which serve as an essential cofactor for stabilizing the ATP substrate within the active site and facilitating the phosphoryl transfer reaction (osawa2011phosphorylationofg pages 1-2).

4. Substrate Specificity  
GRK1 exhibits substrate specificity for active, light‐stimulated G protein‐coupled receptors and primarily phosphorylates serine and threonine residues located within the cytoplasmic regions of rhodopsin; the enzyme’s N-terminal domain plays a key role in docking onto the activated receptor (chen2021structuresofrhodopsin pages 4-6).

5. Structure  
GRK1 is a protein of approximately 561 amino acids that features a short, functionally critical N-terminal regulatory region, an RGS homology (RH) domain, and a central serine/threonine kinase domain characteristic of AGC kinases, followed by a C-terminal extension that terminates with a CAAX motif required for farnesylation and membrane targeting (benovic2021historicalperspectiveof pages 4-6). Crystallographic studies demonstrate that the kinase domain of GRK1 is organized into a small lobe and a large lobe, forming a catalytic cleft where ATP binds, and an N-terminal α-helix that is instrumental in mediating receptor docking (singh2008structuresofrhodopsin pages 5-7). In addition, structural analyses have identified key elements such as the active site tether (AST) loop and other hydrophobic regulatory motifs within the kinase domain that are critical for modulating GRK1 activity upon binding to activated rhodopsin (chen2021structuresofrhodopsin pages 27-29).

6. Regulation  
GRK1 is regulated by multiple post-translational mechanisms; for instance, phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) at specific residues (notably Ser21) modulates its enzymatic activity in response to varying light conditions (osawa2011phosphorylationofg pages 1-2). Moreover, the binding of Ca²⁺-bound recoverin to GRK1 acts as an allosteric inhibitor in darkness by sequestering GRK1 away from the membrane, thereby reducing its ability to phosphorylate rhodopsin until light exposure relieves this inhibition (lee2004rhodopsinkinaseactivity pages 4-5).

7. Function  
GRK1 is predominantly expressed in rod photoreceptor cells where its principal biological function is to phosphorylate light-activated rhodopsin, thereby triggering the binding of arrestin and the termination of the phototransduction cascade (gurevich2012gproteincoupledreceptor pages 19-20). This rapid desensitization mechanism is crucial for scotopic vision, allowing photoreceptors to adapt efficiently to changes in illumination (lee2004rhodopsinkinaseactivity pages 1-1). In addition to its role in the acute termination of phototransduction signals, GRK1 activity is implicated in maintaining the structural integrity of the outer nuclear layer of the retina (benovic2021historicalperspectiveof pages 7-8).

8. Other Comments  
Mutations in GRK1 have been linked to Oguchi disease—a form of congenital stationary night blindness—which underscores the enzyme’s pivotal role in regulating visual phototransduction and maintaining retinal health (weiss2001speciesspecificdifferencesin pages 9-9). Although specific inhibitors dedicated solely to GRK1 are not well established in clinical practice, the unique regulatory mechanisms of GRK1, including its precise post-translational modifications and interactions with accessory proteins such as recoverin, make it a potential target for therapeutic intervention in retinal disorders (watari2014multiplefunctionsof pages 1-2).
