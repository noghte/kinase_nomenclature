1. Phylogeny  
GRK7 (UniProt Q8WTQ7) is a member of the visual subfamily of G protein‐coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), also known as the GRK1 subfamily, which includes both GRK1 and GRK7. GRK7 is evolutionarily conserved across vertebrates and is predominantly expressed in cone photoreceptors, whereas GRK1 is mainly associated with rod photoreceptors and, in some species, co‐expressed in cones. The evolutionary separation of the visual GRKs from the broader GRK family reflects early gene duplication events that enabled specialization of phototransduction mechanisms for rod‐ and cone‐mediated vision. Phylogenetic analyses based on domain conservation and overall sequence homology reveal that the GRK1 subfamily, comprising GRK1 and GRK7, is distinct from the GRK2 and GRK4 subfamilies, with these kinases emerging as an evolutionarily ancient group specific to the vertebrate visual system (gurevich2012gproteincoupledreceptor pages 2-4, mushegian2012theoriginand pages 1-2, lamb2020evolutionofthe pages 58-62, komolov2018gproteincoupledreceptor pages 1-3).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
GRK7 catalyzes the phosphorylation of activated G protein‐coupled receptors (GPCRs) in photoreceptor cells. In the case of visual phototransduction, GRK7 transfers a phosphate group from ATP to specific serine and/or threonine residues located in the intracellular domains (typically the C-terminal tail) of activated cone opsins, including rhodopsin, thereby producing ADP and a phosphorylated receptor along with the release of a proton (gurevich2012gproteincoupledreceptor pages 1-2, gurevich2019gpcrsignalingregulation pages 1-2).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The kinase activity of GRK7 is dependent on ATP as a phosphate donor and requires divalent metal ions, most notably Mg²⁺, as essential cofactors for catalytic function. The binding of ATP in the kinase domain is stabilized by Mg²⁺, which is a common feature among serine/threonine kinases of the AGC family (thompson2008pharmacogenomicsofg pages 18-21, gurevich2012gproteincoupledreceptor pages 1-2).

4. Substrate Specificity  
GRK7 exhibits substrate specificity for activated GPCRs found in cone photoreceptors. Its primary substrates are the cone opsins, including the light-activated form of rhodopsin in cones, where phosphorylation occurs on serine/threonine residues within conserved intracellular regions such as the C-terminal tail and intracellular loops. The specificity of GRK7 depends on the receptor being in an agonist-bound, active conformation, which exposes the target residues for phosphorylation. In several species, GRK7 possesses higher specific activity than its rod counterpart, suggesting a design optimized for the rapid shutoff and recovery of phototransduction in cones (gurevich2012gproteincoupledreceptor pages 19-20, watari2014multiplefunctionsof pages 1-2, weiss2001speciesspecificdifferencesin pages 7-9).

5. Structure  
GRK7 is organized into multiple functional domains that are characteristic of the GRK family. It features an N-terminal region that plays a critical role in receptor recognition and binding. This is followed by a regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) homology (RH) domain, which is thought to contribute to proper folding and possibly modulate interactions with other proteins. The central catalytic domain is a serine/threonine kinase domain typical of the AGC kinase family and is composed of two lobes—the small N-terminal lobe and the larger C-terminal lobe—that form the nucleotide-binding cleft necessary for ATP binding and catalysis. A distinctive feature of GRK7, compared to GRK1, is found in its C-terminal region: it carries a CAAX motif that is post-translationally modified by geranylgeranylation, a lipid modification that facilitates stable membrane association. This modification ensures that GRK7 is localized in close proximity to its cone opsin substrates within the photoreceptor outer segment membranes. Conformational studies imply that, similar to other GRKs, GRK7 adopts an “open” conformation which is further stabilized by receptor binding, allowing efficient phosphorylation of activated visual receptors (gurevich2012gproteincoupledreceptor pages 4-5, gurevich2012gproteincoupledreceptor pages 20-21, komolov2018gproteincoupledreceptor pages 14-15).

6. Regulation  
The activity of GRK7 is tightly regulated through several mechanisms. One key regulatory process involves receptor-dependent activation; GRK7 is selectively activated upon direct binding to an agonist-occupied cone opsin, which induces conformational changes in the kinase that favor an active state. Post-translational modifications also play a significant role in modulating GRK7 activity; for example, phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) at specific serine residues (including Ser36) has been reported to decrease its catalytic activity, whereas light-dependent dephosphorylation can rapidly enhance its activity in photoreceptors. In addition, GRK7’s membrane association through its geranylgeranylated C-terminal region is essential for its functional regulation, ensuring that the kinase remains properly localized near its substrates. These combined mechanisms—direct receptor interaction, post-translational modification, and dynamic membrane association—ensure that GRK7 activity is precisely controlled during phototransduction (gurevich2012gproteincoupledreceptor pages 13-15, gurevich2012gproteincoupledreceptor pages 20-21, watari2014multiplefunctionsof pages 1-2).

7. Function  
GRK7 plays a critical role in the regulation of visual phototransduction in cone photoreceptor cells. It is predominantly expressed in the retina and is responsible for the phosphorylation of activated cone opsins, including rhodopsin, which is a fundamental step in the rapid shutoff of the photoresponse. By catalyzing the phosphorylation of activated receptors, GRK7 promotes the binding of arrestin proteins, which sterically block further coupling of the receptor to G proteins, thereby terminating the signaling cascade. This mechanism is essential for preventing overstimulation in bright light and for adapting the photoreceptors to rapidly changing light conditions. In several species, GRK7 exhibits a higher catalytic efficiency than GRK1 in cones, contributing to the faster recovery kinetics characteristic of cone photoreceptors. Expression studies indicate that in many mammals, GRK7 is highly abundant in both red/green and blue cone populations, suggesting that it is indispensable for normal cone function and visual acuity (gurevich2012gproteincoupledreceptor pages 1-2, gurevich2012gproteincoupledreceptor pages 57-59, watari2014multiplefunctionsof pages 1-2, weiss2001speciesspecificdifferencesin pages 7-9, sato2015theevolvingimpact pages 1-2, sato2015theevolvingimpact pages 2-3).

8. Other Comments  
Although GRK7 has not been as directly implicated in genetic retinal disorders as its relative GRK1—mutations in which are known to cause Oguchi disease—the specialized role of GRK7 in cone photoreceptor recovery suggests that alterations in its expression or function could contribute to cone-specific visual impairments. In experimental animal models, knockdown of GRK7 results in impaired cone recovery and delayed dark adaptation, supporting its essential role in rapid phototransduction shutoff (weiss2001speciesspecificdifferencesin pages 7-9, lamb2020evolutionofthe pages 58-62, poulter2021newvariantsand pages 12-13). Additionally, while research on small-molecule inhibitors and other modulators has focused predominantly on non-visual GRKs for therapeutic purposes in cardiovascular and cancer settings, the high specific activity and unique regulatory mechanisms of GRK7 make it a potential target for interventions aimed at rectifying cone photoreceptor dysfunction. In broader terms, GRK7 is an important component of the intricate network of proteins that ensures precise control over GPCR signaling in the retina, and further investigations may eventually reveal new insights into its role in retinal health and disease (gurevich2012gproteincoupledreceptor pages 55-57, pronin2000synucleinsarea pages 1-1).
