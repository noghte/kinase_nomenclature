1. Phylogeny  
MAP kinase‐activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAPK2 or MK2) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that belongs to the MAPK‐activated protein kinase family, a subgroup within the larger CMGC kinase superfamily that also comprises cyclin‐dependent kinases, glycogen synthase kinases, and CLK kinases (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 1-2, kultz1998phylogeneticandfunctional pages 1-2). MAPKAPK2 is evolutionarily conserved across metazoans; orthologs have been identified in mammalian species as well as in invertebrates such as Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans, where a single homolog performs functions analogous to those of MK2 in vertebrates (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 21-23, cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 26-27). Within the kinase complement described by Manning et al., MK2 is recognized as an effector downstream of stress‐activated MAPK modules, and it is closely related to its homolog MK3—sharing approximately 75% amino acid identity in vertebrates—indicating that gene duplication events occurred early during the evolutionary expansion of this kinase family (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 21-23, kultz1998phylogeneticandfunctional pages 13-14). Phylogenetic analyses, based on conserved kinase domains and shared functional motifs, assign MK2 to the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CAMK) group, which underscores the preservation of its catalytic core and regulatory features throughout eukaryotic evolution (scheeff2005structuralevolutionof pages 5-7, shrestha2022theregulationof pages 34-38).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
MAPKAPK2 catalyzes a phosphorylation reaction in which a phosphate group is transferred from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine residues on specific protein substrates, thereby converting ATP and a target protein into ADP, a phosphorylated protein, and a proton (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 2-4, scheeff2005structuralevolutionof pages 7-9). This reaction follows the common serine/threonine kinase mechanism and plays a critical role in modulating the activity, subcellular localization, and interaction properties of its substrates during cellular responses to stress (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 24-25).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The kinase activity of MAPKAPK2 is dependent on the presence of Mg²⁺ ions, which are essential cofactors that facilitate ATP binding within the active site and stabilize the transition state during the phosphoryl transfer reaction (thiriet2013preambletocytoplasmic pages 1-4, scheeff2005structuralevolutionof pages 5-7). This Mg²⁺ dependency is characteristic of most Ser/Thr protein kinases and is critical for achieving optimum catalysis under physiological conditions (thiriet2013preambletocytoplasmic pages 1-4).

4. Substrate Specificity  
MAPKAPK2 displays a precise substrate specificity characterized by recognition of a consensus motif defined as Hyd‐X‐R‐X(2)‐S, where “Hyd” represents a large hydrophobic amino acid and “S” is the serine residue that becomes phosphorylated (shrestha2022theregulationof pages 34-38). This defined motif ensures that MK2 selectively phosphorylates substrates involved in a variety of cellular processes such as cytokine production, cytoskeletal reorganization, and cell cycle regulation (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 29-30, shrestha2022theregulationof pages 34-38). In addition, the substrate recognition is mediated by docking interactions between MK2’s catalytic cleft and complementary linear motifs present in target proteins, thereby contributing to the specificity observed in phosphorylation events (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 2-4).

5. Structure  
MAPKAPK2 exhibits a canonical protein kinase fold that is typical of serine/threonine kinases, comprising a smaller N-terminal lobe mainly formed by β-strands and a larger C-terminal lobe dominated by α-helices (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 23-24, scheeff2005structuralevolutionof pages 5-7). Detailed crystallographic studies have revealed that the enzyme contains a conserved catalytic core with critical structural features including an activation loop, a C-helix, and a hydrophobic spine that are essential for its enzymatic activity (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 23-24, scheeff2005structuralevolutionof pages 3-5). A key regulatory element is the auto-inhibitory helix, which is displaced upon phosphorylation of Thr334, thereby triggering an open, active conformation that facilitates access to the substrate-binding site (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 23-24, cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 32-32). Moreover, MK2 contains intrinsic nuclear localization (NLS) and nuclear export signals (NES), which are responsible for its regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling in response to stress signals, with NES exposure being controlled by phosphorylation events (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 23-24, shrestha2022theregulationof pages 31-34).

6. Regulation  
Regulation of MAPKAPK2 is mediated primarily through phosphorylation by upstream kinases, most notably p38 MAPK (p38α/MAPK14), which is activated in response to diverse stress stimuli including UV irradiation, oxidative stress, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 23-24, shrestha2022theregulationof pages 31-34). Phosphorylation occurs at key residues—Thr222, Ser272, and Thr334—each of which plays a distinct role in modulating kinase activity; in particular, phosphorylation of Thr334 is crucial for exposing the NES, thereby allowing the MK2–p38 complex to translocate from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 23-24, cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 32-33). In resting cells, MK2 is predominantly localized in the nucleus where it remains in an inactive state; however, upon phosphorylation by p38, it forms a stable complex with its upstream kinase, which not only enhances its stability but also ensures its proper subcellular distribution to effectively phosphorylate downstream substrates (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 32-33, shrestha2022theregulationof pages 28-31). Additionally, conformational changes resulting from phosphorylation relieve autoinhibitory interactions within the kinase domain, thus fully activating MK2’s catalytic function (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 23-24, shrestha2022theregulationof pages 31-34).

7. Function  
MAPKAPK2 is a multifunctional kinase that acts as a key mediator in cellular stress response pathways. It plays essential roles in cytokine production, endocytosis, and the reorganization of the cytoskeleton, thereby influencing cell migration and cell cycle control (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 24-25, cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 29-30). By phosphorylating substrates such as HSP27/HSPB1, MK2 modulates actin cytoskeletal rearrangements that are necessary for cell motility and migration during stress conditions (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 24-25, cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 31-31). In addition, MK2 contributes to the DNA damage response and transcriptional regulation processes; for example, its activity toward CDC25B and CDC25C phosphatases is critical for the enforcement of cell cycle checkpoints following genotoxic stress (shrestha2022theregulationof pages 89-91, cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 29-30). The kinase also regulates mRNA stability through the phosphorylation of RNA-binding proteins such as tristetraprolin (TTP) and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, thereby influencing the expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other stress-responsive genes (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 24-25, shrestha2022theregulationof pages 43-46). Through these diverse roles, MK2 integrates extracellular stress signals into coherent intracellular responses that govern both acute and long-term cellular adaptations.

8. Other Comments  
The central position of MAPKAPK2 in stress and inflammatory signaling pathways has made it a target for drug discovery efforts aimed at mitigating diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and certain cancers (shrestha2022theregulationof pages 95-97, shrestha2022theregulationof pages 91-93). Although many studies have predominantly focused on the inhibition of upstream components like p38 MAPK (with compounds such as SB203580) due to the conserved nature of the kinase domain, there have also been efforts to develop selective small molecule inhibitors that directly target MK2 (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 32-33, shrestha2022theregulationof pages 95-97). Such inhibitors are of particular interest given their potential to disrupt cytokine production and attenuate the inflammatory response, while also impacting cell cycle progression and cytoskeletal dynamics—functions that are central to the kinase’s role in disease pathogenesis. Although explicit disease‐associated mutations in MAPKAPK2 have not been extensively characterized in the literature, its dysregulation has been linked to pathological conditions such as cancer, where altered stress response signaling may contribute to aberrant cell proliferation and survival (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 26-27, shrestha2022theregulationof pages 43-46). The continued investigation of MK2’s regulatory mechanisms and substrate interactions remains essential for a complete understanding of its role in both normal physiology and disease processes.
