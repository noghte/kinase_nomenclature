1. Phylogeny  
MARK2 (Serine/threonine‐protein kinase MARK2), also referred to as ELKL motif kinase 1, MAP/microtubule affinity‐regulating kinase 2, PAR1 homolog or PAR1 homolog b, belongs to the microtubule affinity‐regulating kinase (MARK) family, an evolutionarily conserved subgroup within the AMPK‐related kinases. Its catalytic domain shares significant sequence similarity with the AMP‐activated protein kinase family and with the PAR‐1 kinases originally identified in Caenorhabditis elegans, as well as with yeast kinases such as KIN1 and KIN2. Comparative sequence analyses show that the MARK family, including MARK2, is conserved from yeast to mammals, indicating that it forms part of an ancient kinase module that plays a key role in establishing and maintaining cell polarity and regulating cytoskeletal dynamics (drewes1997markanovel pages 1-2, naz2013microtubuleaffinityregulatingkinase pages 1-3). MARK2 orthologs have been identified in diverse species such as human, rat, and mouse, underlining its conserved role in eukaryotic cell signaling pathways (annunziata2020phosphorylationsitesin pages 5-7). Phylogenetically, MARK2 clusters with its family members MARK1, MARK3, and MARK4, and it is positioned within the broader context of the AMPK/Snf1‐related kinases, a group thought to have originated in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) (drewes1997markanovel pages 1-2).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
MARK2 catalyzes a phosphorylation reaction in which a phosphate group is transferred from ATP to the hydroxyl groups of serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins. The overall chemical reaction can be denoted as:  
  ATP + [protein]–OH → ADP + [protein]–O–PO3²⁻ + H⁺  
This kinase‐mediated phosphorylation event is integral to modulating the function of its substrates, which include microtubule‐associated proteins such as MAPT/TAU, MAP2, and MAP4, among others (drewes1997markanovel pages 1-2, annunziata2020phosphorylationsitesin pages 5-7). The phosphorylation regulates the binding properties and activities of these proteins, thereby influencing microtubule stability and dynamics.

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The enzymatic activity of MARK2 is dependent on the availability of ATP as a phosphate donor and on the presence of divalent metal ions, with magnesium (Mg²⁺) being the essential cofactor. Mg²⁺ ions facilitate correct positioning of the ATP molecule within the catalytic cleft of the kinase domain, thereby ensuring efficient phosphotransfer to the substrate (naz2013microtubuleaffinityregulatingkinase pages 7-8, timm2008structureandregulation pages 1-2).

4. Substrate Specificity  
MARK2 exhibits a marked substrate preference for specific consensus sequences found in microtubule‐associated proteins. The kinase predominantly phosphorylates serine/threonine residues within a KXGS motif, where “K” represents lysine, “X” is any amino acid, “G” is glycine, and “S” is the phosphorylatable serine residue. For instance, phosphorylation of tau protein occurs at key KXGS motifs, including sites such as Ser262, Ser293, Ser324, and Ser356, thereby reducing tau’s ability to bind microtubules and promoting microtubule disassembly (annunziata2020phosphorylationsitesin pages 5-7, drewes1997markanovel pages 1-2, sonntag2019thekldptactivation pages 2-4). In addition to microtubule‐associated proteins, MARK2 phosphorylates other substrates involved in diverse cellular processes, including CRTC2/TORC2, DCX, HDAC7, KIF13B, and RAB11FIP2. The distinct substrate specificity is underpinned by the unique recognition of variant motifs, such as zXKXGSXXNC in the case of tau, and is governed by its conserved catalytic domain (naz2013microtubuleaffinityregulatingkinase pages 8-10, annunziata2020phosphorylationsitesin pages 5-7).

5. Structure  
MARK2 is composed of approximately 722 amino acids, with an estimated molecular weight of around 81 kDa, and it exhibits a modular domain architecture characteristic of the MARK family. The N-terminal region encompasses a divergent “header” domain whose precise function remains to be fully elucidated, whereas the central portion of the protein contains the catalytic kinase domain that adopts the classic bilobal kinase fold. This domain is composed of a smaller N-lobe, which features a set of β-strands and a pivotal αC helix, and a larger C-lobe that is predominantly α-helical. The activation loop, located within the C-lobe, contains the highly conserved KLDPT motif; phosphorylation within this loop is critical for kinase activation and substrate binding (sonntag2019thekldptactivation pages 1-2, pages 13-17). Downstream of the catalytic domain lies a variable spacer region which is enriched in phosphorylation sites that may modulate protein interactions and subcellular localization. Following this spacer is a compact ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain that, despite its nomenclature, has not been shown to strongly bind ubiquitin but instead is believed to exert an autoinhibitory effect by tethering to the N-lobe of the kinase domain in a manner that influences catalytic efficiency (marx2006structuralvariationsin pages 12-13, naz2013microtubuleaffinityregulatingkinase pages 5-7). Finally, the C-terminal tail, which often encompasses a kinase associated 1 (KA1) domain, contributes to membrane localization and may facilitate interactions with other regulatory proteins (drewes1997markanovel pages 7-9, timm2008structureandregulation pages 2-4).

6. Regulation  
MARK2 activity is intricately regulated through a variety of post-translational modifications and protein–protein interactions. A key regulatory mechanism is phosphorylation within the activation loop; for full kinase activation, a conserved threonine residue (for example, T208 in rodent isoforms) must be phosphorylated by upstream kinases such as MARKK (a Ste20-like kinase) and LKB1, thereby stabilizing the active conformation of the kinase domain (drewes1997markanovel pages 4-5, matenia2012microtubuleaffinityregulatingkinase pages 11-12). Conversely, phosphorylation at an adjacent serine residue (e.g., Ser212) by glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) is reported to inhibit MARK2 activity, providing a counterbalance to the activating signals (matenia2012microtubuleaffinityregulatingkinase pages 11-12). In response to proteotoxic stress, MARK2 is activated through phosphorylation by protein kinase C delta (PKCδ), particularly at threonine 595, which in turn enables MARK2 to phosphorylate the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α) at serine 51; this event forms part of a rapidly inducible stress response pathway (lu2021mark2phosphorylateseif2α pages 1-2, pages 6-8). Additionally, MARK2 is subject to acetylation by the CREB-binding protein (CBP) acetyltransferase; this reciprocal regulatory loop, whereby CBP acetylates MARK2 to inhibit its kinase activity while MARK2 can negatively regulate CBP activity, adds another tier of control over its function (tabassum2022identificationofa pages 1-2, pages 4-5). Binding interactions with 14-3-3 proteins further modulate MARK2 activity and subcellular localization, linking its phosphorylation state to downstream signaling outcomes (sonntag2019thekldptactivation pages 20-21).

7. Function  
MARK2 plays critical biological roles by governing cell polarity, regulating microtubule dynamics, and modulating intracellular signal transduction. Through the phosphorylation of microtubule-associated proteins such as MAPT/TAU, MAP2, and MAP4, MARK2 induces the detachment of these proteins from microtubules, leading to increased microtubule dynamic instability and reorganization of the cytoskeleton; this process is fundamental for both neuronal migration and the establishment of epithelial cell polarity (annunziata2020phosphorylationsitesin pages 5-7, drewes1997markanovel pages 7-9). In neuronal cells, MARK2 regulates neurite outgrowth and axon formation by phosphorylating substrates like doublecortin (DCX), which affects neuronal migration and dendritic polarity (annunziata2020phosphorylationsitesin pages 5-7). Moreover, MARK2 phosphorylates KIF13B to modulate its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, thereby inhibiting microtubule-dependent accumulation and regulating axogenesis (annunziata2020phosphorylationsitesin pages 5-7). Beyond its role in cytoskeletal rearrangements, MARK2 also phosphorylates the CREB-regulated transcription coactivator CRTC2 and histone deacetylases such as HDAC7, indicating a function in linking extracellular signals to changes in gene expression through chromatin remodeling (annunziata2020phosphorylationsitesin pages 5-7, tabassum2022identificationofa pages 12-13). In epithelial cells, MARK2 contributes to the regulation of cell polarity by phosphorylating RAB11FIP2, thereby influencing vesicular trafficking and polarized membrane dynamics (annunziata2020phosphorylationsitesin pages 5-7). In animal models, manipulation of MARK2 expression has been associated with alterations in metabolic phenotypes, including changes in insulin sensitivity, adiposity, and growth, which emphasizes its broader role in regulating cellular physiology (annunziata2020phosphorylationsitesin pages 5-7, matenia2012microtubuleaffinityregulatingkinase pages 1-2).

8. Other Comments  
MARK2 is increasingly recognized as a potential therapeutic target due to its involvement in pathological processes such as tau hyperphosphorylation in neurodegenerative diseases. Its role in phosphorylating tau has direct implications for Alzheimer’s disease, wherein abnormal tau phosphorylation leads to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles and neuronal dysfunction (drewes1997markanovel pages 7-9, annunziata2020phosphorylationsitesin pages 5-7). In addition, MARK2’s activation in response to proteotoxic stress via the PKCδ–MARK2–eIF2α axis implicates it in disorders linked to cellular stress responses, including forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (lu2021mark2phosphorylateseif2α pages 6-8, lu2021mark2phosphorylateseif2α pages 8-9). Although no direct, highly selective small-molecule inhibitors of MARK2 have yet emerged from the literature provided, several compounds have been applied experimentally to modulate its activity, and the interplay with CBP acetyltransferase suggests multiple avenues for pharmacological intervention (sonntag2019thekldptactivation pages 22-22, tabassum2022identificationofa pages 7-8). The multifaceted regulatory mechanisms of MARK2, which include phosphorylation, acetylation, and protein–protein interactions, underscore its complexity and validate continuing research into its modulation as a strategy for treating neurodegenerative diseases and potentially certain cancers (tabassum2022identificationofa pages 1-2, matenia2012microtubuleaffinityregulatingkinase pages 11-12).
