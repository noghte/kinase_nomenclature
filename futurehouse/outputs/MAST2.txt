1. Phylogeny  
MAST2, accepted as Microtubule‐associated serine/threonine‐protein kinase 2 and also known as MAST205 or KIAA0807, is classified within the AGC kinase superfamily and forms part of the MAST kinase subfamily, which in vertebrates comprises four members (MAST1–4) while many invertebrates encode a single ortholog (rumpf2023microtubuleassociatedserinethreonine(mast) pages 1-2, karpov2009bioinformaticsearchof pages 6-7). Phylogenetic analyses based on conserved catalytic domains have demonstrated that the key functional motifs in the kinase domain are highly conserved among diverse species ranging from lower eukaryotes to mammals, confirming an evolutionary relationship that dates back to the last common eukaryotic ancestor (rumpf2023microtubuleassociatedserinethreonine(mast) pages 1-2, karpov2010bioinformaticsearchof pages 7-10).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
MAST2 catalyzes the transfer of the γ‐phosphate from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues in target proteins. The overall chemical reaction is as follows:  
  ATP + [protein]–(L‑serine or L‑threonine) → ADP + [protein]–(L‑serine/threonine)‑phosphate + H⁺ (rumpf2023microtubuleassociatedserinethreonine(mast) pages 2-5).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The kinase activity of MAST2 is dependent on the presence of Mg²⁺, which is required to coordinate ATP binding within the active site and facilitate the phosphoryl transfer reaction (rumpf2023microtubuleassociatedserinethreonine(mast) pages 2-5).

4. Substrate Specificity  
MAST2 phosphorylates serine/threonine residues within its substrates. The substrate specificity is dictated in part by intrinsic features of its catalytic domain and is further refined by its C-terminal PDZ domain. This PDZ domain preferentially recognizes C-terminal motifs conforming to a pattern of X-S/T-X-V/I/L, thereby directing MAST2 toward proteins involved in the stabilization and regulation of the dystrophin/utrophin network (rumpf2023microtubuleassociatedserinethreonine(mast) pages 2-5). In addition, MAST2 has been linked to the phosphorylation of proteins that are components of multi‐protein complexes involved in spermatid maturation and in the regulation of immune signaling in macrophages (karpov2009bioinformaticsearchof pages 6-7, lumeng1999interactionsbetweenβ2syntrophin pages 1-2).

5. Structure  
MAST2 exhibits a characteristic modular organization that includes three major domains. At the N-terminus is the DUF1908 domain, a region enriched in serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues; although its precise function remains unresolved, it is conceivable that it serves as a regulatory module subject to phosphorylation (rumpf2023microtubuleassociatedserinethreonine(mast) pages 2-5). Centrally, MAST2 contains the serine/threonine kinase domain that adopts the classical bilobular structure associated with the AGC kinase family. In this domain, key conserved motifs—including the DFG, APE, and HRD sequences—form the catalytic core required for ATP binding and phosphoryl transfer. Notably, a substitution in the glycine-rich loop, wherein the first glycine is replaced by a serine, is a distinguishing feature that may influence the regulation of kinase activity (rumpf2023microtubuleassociatedserinethreonine(mast) pages 5-7, karpov2010bioinformaticsearchof pages 4-7). At the C-terminus lies the PDZ domain, a compact module approximately 80–100 amino acids in length whose structure consists of five β-strands and two α-helices. This domain confers the ability to engage in specific protein-protein interactions by recognizing short C-terminal motifs on target proteins (rumpf2023microtubuleassociatedserinethreonine(mast) pages 7-8, lumeng1999interactionsbetweenβ2syntrophin pages 1-2). Structural models derived from experimental data and AlphaFold predictions collectively indicate that the overall three-dimensional organization of MAST2 is conserved within the MAST family, ensuring the proper spatial arrangement of its active site cleft and regulatory regions (karpov2010bioinformaticsearchof pages 7-10, sun2006identificationofa pages 1-4).

6. Regulation  
MAST2 is subject to multiple layers of regulation. Autophosphorylation events and phosphorylation by other kinases likely occur within conserved elements of the activation loop, although specific phosphorylation sites have not been exhaustively mapped (rumpf2023microtubuleassociatedserinethreonine(mast) pages 16-17). The C-terminal PDZ domain not only mediates substrate recognition but also influences MAST2’s autophosphorylation, suggesting an inter-domain regulatory mechanism (rumpf2023microtubuleassociatedserinethreonine(mast) pages 10-11). Furthermore, interactions with regulatory proteins—such as the 14-3-3 family, which bind in a phosphorylation-dependent manner—may further modulate MAST2 activity (rumpf2023microtubuleassociatedserinethreonine(mast) pages 7-8). In macrophages, MAST2 forms a complex with TRAF6; this interaction is associated with the inhibition of TRAF6-mediated NF-κB activation, thereby affecting cytokine expression such as IL-12 (Information, rumpf2023microtubuleassociatedserinethreonine(mast) pages 10-11).

7. Function  
MAST2 functions at the intersection of cytoskeletal organization and signal transduction. Through the PDZ-mediated association with the dystrophin/utrophin network, MAST2 plays a central role in linking microtubule filaments to membrane-associated complexes. This interaction is critical for the proper formation and function of the multi-protein complex involved in spermatid maturation, particularly at the spermatid manchette (walden1993anovel205kilodalton pages 1-2, karpov2009bioinformaticsearchof pages 7-9). Additionally, in immune cells such as macrophages, MAST2 regulates inflammatory signaling; by forming a complex with TRAF6, it modulates the lipopolysaccharide-induced synthesis of IL-12 via inhibition of NF-κB activation (Information, rumpf2023microtubuleassociatedserinethreonine(mast) pages 10-11). These roles underscore MAST2’s importance in both reproductive biology and immune regulation.

8. Other Comments  
MAST2 is alternatively designated as MAST205, reflecting its original identification in a testis-specific context associated with microtubule structures (walden1993anovel205kilodalton pages 1-2). At present, no highly selective pharmacological inhibitors for MAST2 have been well characterized in the peer-reviewed literature provided. Although disease associations—such as potential roles in reproductive and immune system disorders—are implied by its functional involvement in spermatid maturation and cytokine regulation, detailed pathogenic mutations specific to MAST2 remain to be documented (karpov2009bioinformaticsearchof pages 7-9, rumpf2023microtubuleassociatedserinethreonine(mast) pages 7-8).
