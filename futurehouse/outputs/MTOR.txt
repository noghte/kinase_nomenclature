1. Phylogeny  
Serine/threonine‐protein kinase mTOR belongs to the phosphatidylinositol 3‐kinase–related kinase (PIKK) family, a group of large, evolutionarily conserved kinases that share a highly preserved catalytic core and specialized regulatory domains. Orthologs of mTOR have been identified throughout eukaryotes—from yeast to mammals—indicating that its function as a nutrient‐sensing regulatory molecule originated as early as the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) (alexander2015theconciseguide pages 1-2). In evolutionary reconstructions, mTOR clusters with other PIKK family members, such as ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (ATM and Rad3-related), which typically function to preserve genomic stability via DNA damage responses. However, in contrast to ATM and ATR, mTOR primarily integrates a wide variety of extracellular signals including hormones, growth factors, and nutrients with intracellular energy status and stress signals to coordinate both anabolic and catabolic processes (alexander2017theconciseguide pages 2-3, eliasvillalobos2019newinsightsinto pages 1-6). Moreover, the presence of extensive tandem HEAT repeats in the N-terminal region, along with a well‐preserved kinase domain across multiple species, reinforces the concept that mTOR’s central role in growth and metabolism regulation is ancient and highly conserved (tobak2007constructionofthe pages 7-15, panwar2023multifacetedroleof pages 1-2).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
mTOR functions as a serine/threonine kinase that catalyzes the ATP‐dependent phosphorylation of protein substrates. The canonical reaction it facilitates can be represented as follows:  
ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺.  
This reaction underpins mTOR’s regulatory capacity over a wide range of cellular processes, enabling it to modify the activity, stability, or interactions of its substrates through the addition of a phosphate group. Such phosphorylation events are critical for the modulation of processes like protein synthesis, ribosome biogenesis, lipid metabolism, and autophagy (alexander2015theconciseguide pages 1-2, alexander2017theconciseguide pages 2-3).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The catalytic activity of mTOR is strictly ATP‐dependent. It requires divalent cations, with magnesium (Mg²⁺) being the principal cofactor. This Mg²⁺ cofactor stabilizes the binding of ATP within the kinase’s catalytic pocket and facilitates the correct alignment of the phosphate groups for the transfer reaction. The necessity for Mg²⁺ is consistent with the enzymatic behavior of other protein kinases in the PIKK family, ensuring both the efficiency of phosphoryl transfer and the structural integrity of the active site (alexander2015theconciseguide pages 1-2, liu2012kinomewideselectivityprofiling pages 9-10).

4. Substrate Specificity  
mTOR exhibits broad substrate specificity, directly or indirectly regulating the phosphorylation of over 800 protein targets. Among its best characterized substrates are components central to the regulation of mRNA translation and ribosome biogenesis, such as the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (EIF4EBP1) and the ribosomal protein S6 kinases (RPS6KB1 and RPS6KB2). For example, phosphorylation of EIF4EBP1 by mTOR disrupts its binding to eIF4E, thereby lifting the repression on cap-dependent translation initiation. In addition, mTOR-mediated phosphorylation of RPS6KB1/2 leads to the activation of downstream effectors, including ribosomal protein S6 and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4B (EIF4B), which are crucial for efficient protein synthesis. Although an explicit consensus phosphorylation motif for mTOR is not as distinctly defined as for some other kinases, substrate recognition is governed largely by the structural context provided by the mTOR complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2). Substrates generally encompass serine/threonine residues that are embedded in regulatory sequences controlling anabolic processes, lipid metabolism, autophagy, and nucleotide synthesis (alexander2015theconciseguide pages 1-2, alexander2017theconciseguide pages 5-8, liu2012kinomewideselectivityprofiling pages 1-1, armando2022gproteincoupledreceptor pages 18-19).

5. Structure  
mTOR is a multidomain protein whose structural complexity reflects its multifaceted regulatory functions. Its key structural features include:  
• The N-terminal region, characterized by approximately 20 tandem HEAT repeats, forms an elongated solenoid that mediates extensive protein–protein interactions. These HEAT repeats are essential for the assembly of the two distinct mTOR complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, by facilitating interactions with regulatory proteins such as RAPTOR in mTORC1 and RICTOR in mTORC2 (tobak2007constructionofthe pages 7-15).  
• Adjacent to the HEAT repeats lies the FAT domain (named for FRAP, ATM, and TRRAP), which contributes to the overall structural integrity and proper folding of mTOR, as well as to intra‐molecular interactions that are critical for maintaining kinase activity.  
• Central to mTOR’s function is its catalytic kinase domain. This domain shares sequence and structural homology with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K), encompassing the ATP-binding pocket and essential catalytic residues. Within the kinase domain, features such as the activation loop, hydrophobic spine, and the C-helix are present; these elements are characteristic of an active kinase conformation and are vital for the binding of ATP and small molecule inhibitors (tobak2007constructionofthe pages 32-39, alexander2017theconciseguide pages 5-8).  
• Integrated within the catalytic core is the FRB (FKBP12-rapamycin binding) domain, a conserved module that is responsible for binding the FKBP12-rapamycin complex. This interaction serves as the basis for allosteric inhibition by rapamycin, making the FRB domain a critical regulatory motif (tobak2007constructionofthe pages 39-44).  
• At the extreme C-terminus, mTOR contains the FATC domain. This short, conserved segment is necessary for full kinase activity and helps stabilize the overall structure of the catalytic domain.  
Homology modeling studies have employed the crystal structure of PI3Kγ as a template to elucidate the three-dimensional organization of the mTOR kinase domain, confirming that features such as the ATP-binding pocket, activation loop arrangement, and hydrophobic spine are conserved and functionally significant (tobak2007constructionofthe pages 32-39, tobak2007constructionofthe pages 39-44).

6. Regulation  
The regulatory mechanisms governing mTOR activity are both intricate and dynamic, ensuring that its kinase function is tightly controlled in response to a variety of cellular signals. Within the mTORC1 complex, the regulatory subunit RAPTOR acts as a scaffold to not only stabilize the complex but also facilitate the recruitment of both substrates and upstream activators. For instance, under nutrient-rich conditions, mTORC1 is localized to the lysosomal membrane where it becomes activated by RHEB GTPase. Active mTORC1 phosphorylates several downstream targets including EIF4EBP1 and RPS6KB1, which in turn enhance protein synthesis (alexander2015theconciseguide pages 1-2, rowland2010identificationoftheb pages 163-165).  
Notably, mTORC1 phosphorylates ULK1 at Ser758 under nutrient sufficiency, which disrupts its interaction with AMPK and inhibits the initiation of autophagy. Additionally, mTORC1 mediates feedback inhibition on upstream growth factor signaling through the phosphorylation of GRB10, thereby modulating insulin receptor signals (panwar2023multifacetedroleof pages 1-2, shams2021evaluationofthe pages 13-14).  
In contrast, mTORC2, which is largely nutrient-insensitive, primarily responds to growth factor cues. Its regulatory subunits—most notably RICTOR and SIN1—determine substrate specificity for mTORC2. One of the critical functions of mTORC2 is the phosphorylation of AGC kinase family members such as AKT. Phosphorylation of AKT by mTORC2 at multiple residues (including Thr-450, Ser-473, Ser-477, and Thr-479) is essential for subsequent phosphorylation events by PDPK1/PDK1 and complete activation of AKT signaling (alexander2017theconciseguide pages 2-3, liu2012kinomewideselectivityprofiling pages 9-10).  
Furthermore, mTOR can undergo autophosphorylation and interact with additional regulatory proteins via dynamic exchange of complex components, contributing to its context-dependent modulation. These multiple layers of regulation ensure that mTOR activity is finely adjusted in accordance with cellular nutrient status, energy levels, and extrinsic growth factor signals (alexander2015theconciseguide pages 1-2, panwar2023multifacetedroleof pages 1-2, shams2021evaluationofthe pages 13-14).

7. Function  
mTOR acts as a master regulator orchestrating cellular growth, metabolism, and survival processes by integrating diverse signals from the environment. As part of the mTORC1 complex, mTOR promotes anabolic processes when nutrients are abundant. Specifically, it phosphorylates EIF4EBP1 to alleviate its inhibition on eIF4E, thereby enhancing cap‐dependent mRNA translation and stimulating protein synthesis. Concurrently, the phosphorylation of RPS6KB1/2 leads to activation of downstream effectors such as ribosomal protein S6 and EIF4B, further supporting ribosome biogenesis and translation (alexander2015theconciseguide pages 1-2, rowland2010identificationoftheb pages 163-165).  
mTORC1 also plays a pivotal role in regulating lipid production through the modulation of transcription factors like SREBF1 and enzymes such as LPIN1, in addition to stimulating nucleotide synthesis through both the acute phosphorylation of enzymes such as CAD and transcriptional support via stimulation of the pentose phosphate pathway. In parallel, mTORC1 represses autophagy under nutrient‐rich conditions by phosphorylating ULK1 and other autophagy regulators (panwar2023multifacetedroleof pages 1-2, eliasvillalobos2019newinsightsinto pages 1-6).  
Conversely, in the context of the mTORC2 complex, mTOR transduces growth factor signals that are fundamental for cell survival, proliferation, and cytoskeletal organization. mTORC2 phosphorylates and activates members of the AGC kinase family, including AKT, PKC isoforms, and SGK1, thereby contributing to processes such as actin cytoskeleton remodeling, cell migration, and metabolic control. The phosphorylation events mediated by mTORC2 ensure proper activation of AKT, which then coordinates further downstream metabolic and survival pathways (alexander2017theconciseguide pages 2-3, liu2012kinomewideselectivityprofiling pages 9-10, armando2022gproteincoupledreceptor pages 18-19).  
Together, mTORC1 and mTORC2 serve as essential nodes in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. mTOR’s ubiquitous expression across diverse tissues and cell types underscores its central role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by balancing anabolic growth and catabolic degradation in response to fluctuating nutrient levels and growth signals (alexander2015theconciseguide pages 1-2, panwar2023multifacetedroleof pages 1-2).

8. Other Comments  
A wide array of inhibitors has been developed targeting mTOR due to its central involvement in numerous diseases, particularly cancer and metabolic disorders. The prototypical inhibitor, rapamycin, together with its analogs (rapalogs), binds to the FRB domain of mTOR in a complex with FKBP12, thereby exerting an allosteric inhibition that primarily affects mTORC1. However, because mTORC2 remains relatively insensitive to short-term rapamycin treatment, second-generation ATP-competitive inhibitors such as Torin1 and PP242 have been designed to target the catalytic domain of mTOR, resulting in broad inhibition of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities (tobak2007constructionofthe pages 15-21, panwar2023multifacetedroleof pages 1-2).  
Additionally, mTOR signaling is frequently hyperactivated in a variety of malignancies due to genetic alterations in upstream regulators—for example, mutations in PI3K, loss of PTEN function, or direct mutations in the MTOR gene itself. Such aberrations lead to uncontrolled cellular proliferation and survival, making mTOR an attractive therapeutic target in oncology. Structural insights, particularly those derived from homology modeling of the mTOR kinase domain based on PI3Kγ structures, continue to inform the rational design of novel inhibitors with improved specificity and reduced adverse effects (tobak2007constructionofthe pages 32-39, tobak2007constructionofthe pages 39-44).  
Furthermore, mTOR’s extensive substrate repertoire, including its regulation of key proteins involved in translation (such as EIF4EBP1 and RPS6KB1/2), lipid synthesis, and autophagy, has implicated this kinase in a range of pathologies beyond cancer, including metabolic syndromes, neurodegenerative disorders, and immunological diseases. These observations emphasize the necessity for continued research into mTOR’s structural and functional mechanisms to facilitate the development of more selective and effective therapeutic agents (safi2023phaseseparationbasedvisualization pages 15-16, shams2021evaluationofthe pages 13-14).
