1. Phylogeny  
NEK3 is a member of the NIMA‐related kinase (NEK) family, a group of serine/threonine protein kinases that in humans comprises eleven members (NEK1–NEK11). Phylogenetic analyses based on the conservation of the catalytic domain indicate that NEK3 shares significant sequence identity with ancestral NIMA kinases originally identified in Aspergillus nidulans, and its orthologs are present across mammalian species. In evolutionary studies, NEK3 has been grouped within a distinct clade that includes other related kinases such as NEK1 and NEK4, even though its overall regulatory region is divergent. Unlike many other NEKs that possess coiled‐coil regions in their C-terminal domains, NEK3 lacks such motifs, a characteristic that has led to its classification into a separate subfamily within the NEK kinome. This divergence from the canonical structure is evident from both sequence and domain analyses, and its presence on human chromosome 13q14.2 has been confirmed by molecular cloning studies. The evolutionary conservation of the catalytic domain supports the view that NEK3 fulfills fundamental cellular roles inherited from a common eukaryotic ancestor, as reported in comparative kinase studies (bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 11-13, clevenger2016identificationofnek3 pages 1-2, fry2017mitoticregulationby pages 1-2).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
NEK3 functions as a serine/threonine protein kinase by catalyzing the transfer of a phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins. The overall biochemical reaction catalyzed by NEK3 can be summarized as follows:  
ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺  
This phosphoryl transfer reaction is the hallmark of protein kinases and underlies the modulation of substrate activity, protein–protein interactions, and downstream signaling cascades, as seen in many cell cycle and signaling kinases (bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 11-13, clevenger2016identificationofnek3 pages 1-2).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
Like most serine/threonine protein kinases, NEK3 requires divalent metal ions for its catalytic activity. In particular, magnesium ions (Mg²⁺) are essential; they coordinate the binding of ATP within the active site, thereby facilitating the proper positioning required for the phosphoryl transfer reaction. Although detailed cofactor requirements for NEK3 have not been explicitly reported beyond its categorization as a typical serine/threonine kinase, the dependence on Mg²⁺ is consistent with established biochemical mechanisms observed in related kinases (bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 11-13, clevenger2016identificationofnek3 pages 1-2).

4. Substrate Specificity  
Experimental studies using in vitro kinase assays indicate that NEK3 exhibits substrate specificity principally toward threonine residues within its target substrates. In particular, autophosphorylation studies have identified that threonine 165 (Thr-165), located in the activation segment of the kinase domain, plays a critical role in NEK3 activation; mutation of Thr-165 to a non-phosphorylatable residue results in a profound loss of kinase activity. This observation underscores the importance of this residue for both autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation events. Detailed investigations have further revealed that NEK3’s substrate recognition is characteristic of the conserved motifs observed in the Group 1 NEK kinases. Specifically, the consensus substrate motif appears to include a variable residue at position −5, a preference for tryptophan (W) at position −4, a bulky hydrophobic residue (e.g., leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, or tryptophan) at position −3, and a strict requirement for an arginine (R) at position −1 relative to the phospho-acceptor threonine (position 0). Additionally, residue positions immediately following the phosphorylated site may favor basic residues such as lysine (K) or arginine (R), although these positions are less stringently defined. Substrates known to be modified by NEK3 in cellular systems include proteins involved in focal adhesion dynamics, such as paxillin (PXN) and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor VAV2; phosphorylation of these proteins contributes to cytoskeletal remodeling and cell motility. The collective data indicate that NEK3 targets threonine residues embedded within a motif that is defined by critical upstream hydrophobic and basic amino acids, thereby ensuring substrate specificity necessary for its signaling functions (clevenger2016identificationofnek3 pages 3-4, clevenger2016identificationofnek3 pages 16-17).

5. Structure  
The structural architecture of NEK3 is composed of a conserved N-terminal catalytic kinase domain and a divergent C-terminal regulatory region. The catalytic domain of NEK3 adopts the canonical bilobal kinase fold observed in many serine/threonine kinases. The smaller N-terminal lobe is predominantly formed of β-sheets and houses the glycine-rich loop involved in ATP binding, while the larger C-terminal lobe is mainly α-helical, containing critical elements such as the HRD motif in the catalytic loop and the activation segment that includes Thr-165. Phosphorylation within the activation loop is essential for aligning catalytic residues and thereby facilitates substrate binding and phosphotransfer. Although no high-resolution crystal structure is currently available for the full-length protein, homology models and predictions based on AlphaFold indicate that the NEK3 catalytic domain is very similar to established kinase structures, with a well-defined C-helix that plays a role in coordinating the active conformation of the enzyme.

There is, however, some discrepancy in reported protein lengths. One study reports NEK3 as consisting of 459 amino acids, while another reports a length of 506 amino acids. These differences may be attributed to alternative splicing variants or differences in experimental constructs used during cloning. Moreover, unlike many other NEK family members that contain coiled-coil regions in their C-terminal domains, NEK3’s regulatory region lacks such motifs, a feature which suggests a distinct regulatory mechanism and possibly different modes of protein–protein interaction. The overall three-dimensional organization of NEK3, inferred from comparative and predictive structural analyses, emphasizes the conservation of the catalytic core and activation loop, which is paramount for its enzymatic function (clevenger2016identificationofnek3 pages 1-2, clevenger2016identificationofnek3 pages 17-18, pavan2021onbrokenne(c)ks pages 3-5).

6. Regulation  
NEK3’s kinase activity is controlled by multiple regulatory inputs that involve both post-translational modifications and interactions with other signaling proteins. Central to its regulation is the phosphorylation of critical threonine residues within the activation loop, with Thr-165 being a major regulatory site. Phosphorylation of Thr-165, which can be mediated by upstream kinases such as ERK1/2, is indispensable for achieving the active conformation of NEK3. This activation event is further reinforced by NEK3’s ability to autophosphorylate, thereby sustaining its catalytic activity.

In addition to autophosphorylation, NEK3 activity is modulated in response to extracellular signals. Prolactin, a hormone implicated in breast cancer progression, activates NEK3 through its receptor, thereby initiating a signaling cascade in which NEK3 interacts with guanine nucleotide exchange factors like VAV1 and VAV2. The interaction with VAV2 is particularly significant because it facilitates the activation of Rac1, a small GTPase that orchestrates actin cytoskeletal reorganization. Moreover, NEK3 has been shown to contribute to focal adhesion remodeling through phosphorylation of substrates such as paxillin (PXN), a modification that is critical for promoting cell motility. Experimental data further illustrate that expression of kinase-dead NEK3 mutants leads to apoptosis in T47D breast cancer cells, highlighting that NEK3’s enzymatic activity is vital for cell survival and proper cytoskeletal dynamics (clevenger2016identificationofnek3 pages 17-18, bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 11-13).

These regulatory mechanisms collectively ensure that NEK3 activity is tightly controlled, allowing it to integrate extracellular signals—such as those from prolactin—with intracellular cytoskeletal dynamics. The combination of activation loop phosphorylation, autophosphorylation, and specific protein–protein interactions provides a sophisticated means by which NEK3 activity is modulated in response to cellular conditions (clevenger2016identificationofnek3 pages 3-4, bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 11-13).

7. Function  
NEK3 fulfills multiple cellular roles that span from the regulation of neuronal development to the modulation of cell motility in breast cancer. In neuronal cells, NEK3 has been implicated in the regulation of microtubule acetylation, a modification that influences neuronal morphogenesis and polarity. Through its effect on microtubule dynamics, NEK3 contributes to the establishment and maintenance of neuronal architecture, which is critical for proper cell polarity and signal transduction in the nervous system.

In the context of breast cancer, NEK3 plays an important role in prolactin-mediated signaling pathways. Upon prolactin stimulation, NEK3 is activated and interacts with VAV2, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, leading to the activation of Rac1. This cascade results in the phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins such as paxillin (PXN), thereby facilitating focal adhesion turnover and cytoskeletal reorganization. These modifications ultimately enhance cell migration and invasion, processes that are central to cancer metastasis. The involvement of NEK3 in these signaling pathways has been demonstrated by studies showing that phosphorylation events mediated by NEK3 are essential for the cytoskeletal reorganization underlying breast cancer cell motility (bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 11-13, clevenger2016identificationofnek3 pages 17-18).

Furthermore, NEK3 has also been linked to cell cycle regulation. Although its roles in mitosis are not as extensively characterized as those of other NEK family members (such as NEK2 or NEK6), there is evidence that suppression of NEK3 can lead to cytokinesis defects, as indicated by DNA bridge formation and delayed cytokinesis. Such findings suggest that NEK3 may contribute to the maintenance of genomic integrity during cell division. This dual functionality—regulating both the cytoskeleton and aspects of cell cycle progression—positions NEK3 as a multifaceted kinase whose activity is crucial for both normal cellular physiology and pathological conditions such as cancer (bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 28-29, clevenger2016identificationofnek3 pages 1-2, pavan2021onbrokenne(c)ks pages 3-5).

Overall, the expression of NEK3 is observed in several tissues, with notable expression in neuronal tissues and in breast cancer cells, which underlines its diverse functional roles in both normal cellular processes and disease states (bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 11-13, clevenger2016identificationofnek3 pages 17-18).

8. Other Comments  
NEK3 has emerged as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention, particularly in the context of breast cancer where its activation through prolactin signaling promotes cell motility and invasion. Genomic studies have mapped NEK3 to chromosome 13q14.2, a locus that has been associated with frequent deletions in certain cancers. Although specific small molecule inhibitors directly targeting NEK3 have not yet been widely reported, its critical role in the regulation of focal adhesion dynamics and cytoskeletal reorganization underscores the potential of NEK3 as a candidate for drug discovery efforts. Inhibition of NEK3 could conceivably interfere with the downstream activation of Rac1 and the ensuing cytoskeletal changes, thereby reducing the invasive potential of cancer cells. In addition to its role in oncogenic signaling pathways, NEK3’s regulation of microtubule acetylation in neurons suggests that it may also have implications in neurodevelopmental processes and possibly in neurological disorders. Detailed structural studies and substrate profiling of NEK3’s kinase domain will be essential for the future development of selective inhibitors aimed at modulating its activity (bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 11-13, clevenger2016identificationofnek3 pages 1-2, zhang2014neverinmitosis pages 6-6).
