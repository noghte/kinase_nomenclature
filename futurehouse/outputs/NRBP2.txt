1. Phylogeny  
NRBP2 belongs to the NRBP gene family of pseudokinases found predominantly in metazoans. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that NRBP2 and its paralog NRBP1 originated from a gene duplication event early in vertebrate evolution, with NRBP2 showing an accelerated rate of amino acid substitution in bony vertebrates (yang2024targetingtheparalog pages 1-5, yang2024targetingtheparalog pages 14-17). NRBP2 orthologs are identifiable across Euteleostomi, and the NRBP family co‐evolved alongside related gene families such as TSC22D and WNK, which are involved in cellular stress responses and macromolecular crowd sensing (xiao2024tsc22dwnkandnrbpgenefamiliesexhibit pages 9-11).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
NRBP2 is classified as a pseudokinase and does not catalyze a phosphorylation reaction. No ATP-dependent transfer of phosphate to a protein substrate occurs because NRBP2 lacks the essential catalytic residues required for kinase activity (li2021nrbp2functionsas pages 1-2, yang2024targetingtheparalog pages 1-5).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
As NRBP2 does not exhibit catalytic activity, it does not require cofactors such as Mg²⁺ or Mn²⁺ for enzymatic function (li2021nrbp2functionsas pages 1-2, yang2024targetingtheparalog pages 1-5).

4. Substrate Specificity  
Due to its status as a catalytically inactive pseudokinase, NRBP2 does not demonstrate substrate specificity. It does not phosphorylate substrates nor does it recognize consensus sequence motifs typically found in active serine/threonine kinases (li2021nrbp2functionsas pages 10-11, yang2024targetingtheparalog pages 1-5).

5. Structure  
NRBP2 is a protein of approximately 55–60 kDa that exhibits a modular domain architecture. Its central region adopts a kinase‐like domain that lacks the catalytic residues essential for phosphoryl transfer, thus classifying it as a pseudokinase. The N-terminal portion is predicted to be intrinsically disordered, which may confer structural flexibility, while the C-terminal region is structured and contains several critical motifs including the nuclear receptor-binding (NRB) motif, a dimerization region, nuclear localization (NLS) and export signals (NES), and an Elongin BC-binding (BC box) motif. These structural features are supported by domain mapping experiments and computational predictions such as AlphaFold models, and the C-terminal half is noted to be necessary and sufficient for mediating protein–protein interactions that lead to downstream regulatory effects (yang2024targetingtheparalog pages 37-40, yang2024targetingtheparalog pages 40-44, li2021nrbp2functionsas pages 1-2).

6. Regulation  
NRBP2 operates as a regulatory protein rather than an enzyme. It controls the stability and localization of its paralog NRBP1 through post-translational mechanisms. Specifically, NRBP2 interacts with NRBP1 via its C-terminal domain containing the NRB motif and promotes proteasome-mediated degradation of NRBP1. This regulatory mechanism has been observed in human cell assays, where overexpression of NRBP2 results in reduced NRBP1 protein levels, an effect that can be inhibited by the proteasome inhibitor MG132. These findings indicate that NRBP2 functions as an adaptor protein that modulates the protein homeostasis of NRBP1 without engaging in direct catalytic modification (yang2024targetingtheparalog pages 11-14, yang2024targetingtheparalog pages 37-40).

7. Function  
NRBP2 is implicated in the regulation of cell survival during neural progenitor cell differentiation. It is expressed in neural progenitor cells and has been shown to play a role in modulating apoptosis during differentiation processes. In addition, studies in cancer cell models report that NRBP2 functions as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell proliferation, invasion, and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition through modulation of pathways such as AMPK/mTOR signaling (li2021nrbp2functionsas pages 1-2, li2021nrbp2functionsas pages 10-11). NRBP2 also exerts a regulatory effect on LINE-1 retrotransposition by promoting the degradation of NRBP1, thereby influencing the assembly of LINE-1 ribonucleoprotein complexes (yang2024targetingtheparalog pages 37-40).

8. Other Comments  
NRBP2 is alternatively known as Transformation-related gene 16 protein. Although it has been implicated in neural cell apoptosis and tumor suppression, NRBP2 does not exhibit intrinsic catalytic activity. Its function is mediated through protein–protein interactions and regulation of proteasome-mediated degradation pathways. Additionally, reduced NRBP2 expression has been correlated with the upregulation of innate immune response genes and with rheumatoid arthritis, indicating a potential link with autoimmune processes. NRBP2 has also been identified as one of the candidate genes within the 8q24.3 copy-number variant region, where gene dosage effects may contribute to multisystem phenotypes (dauber2013scribandpuf60 pages 4-5, li2022gatabindingprotein pages 20-21).
