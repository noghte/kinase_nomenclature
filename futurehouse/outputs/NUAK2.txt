1. Phylogeny  
NUAK2 is a member of the SNF1/AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)–related kinase family, a group of serine/threonine kinases that have been conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution. Orthologs of NUAK2 are present from invertebrates to mammals, indicating that this kinase emerged early in the evolution of eukaryotes and has been maintained due to its essential functions in metabolic and stress‐response signaling (minchenko2012snf1ampactivatedproteinkinases pages 1-3, zagorska2010newrolesfor pages 1-2). Within the kinase phylogeny, NUAK2 shares close sequence similarity and conserved catalytic features with NUAK1 and falls within a subgroup of AMPK-related kinases that are activated by the tumor suppressor LKB1. These kinases form a critical regulatory module that also includes the classical AMPK heterotrimer, with components dating back to the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor. Thus, NUAK2 is firmly positioned among a core set of kinases that regulate energy homeostasis and cytoskeletal dynamics in multiple species (monteverde2015evidenceofcancer‐promoting pages 7-8, faisal2020developmentandtherapeutic pages 1-2).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
NUAK2 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to specific serine/threonine residues on its substrate proteins. The chemical reaction can be summarized as follows:  
  ATP + [protein]–(L‑serine or L‑threonine) → ADP + [protein]–(L‑serine/threonine)‑phosphate + H⁺  
This phosphorylation event, common to all serine/threonine kinases, alters the conformation or activity of target proteins and is critical for regulating processes such as cytoskeletal reorganization, cell adhesion and apoptotic protection (bonnard2020alossoffunctionnuak2 pages 1-2, faisal2020developmentandtherapeutic pages 13-15).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The kinase activity of NUAK2 depends on the presence of key cofactors that are required by serine/threonine kinases in general. In particular, NUAK2 utilizes ATP as the phosphate donor, and its catalytic activity is critically dependent on the binding of divalent metal ions—primarily magnesium (Mg²⁺)—which facilitate the proper positioning of ATP within the active site and stabilize the negative charges on the phosphate groups during transfer (banerjee2014characterizationofwz4003 pages 1-2, faisal2020developmentandtherapeutic pages 2-3).

4. Substrate Specificity  
NUAK2 phosphorylates serine/threonine residues on substrate proteins involved in diverse cellular pathways. Although a precise consensus sequence has not been as rigorously defined for NUAK2 as for some kinases, available evidence demonstrates that its substrates are central to the regulation of cell adhesion, cytoskeletal organization, and signal transduction. Notably, NUAK2 phosphorylates key components of the Hippo signaling pathway, including LATS1 and LATS2, which in turn regulate the nuclear localization and transcriptional activity of YAP1—a critical effector in cell proliferation and organ growth (bonnard2020alossoffunctionnuak2 pages 1-2, vis2021nuak1andnuak2 pages 12-14). Additional substrates include proteins that modulate filamentous actin (F‐actin) dynamics since NUAK2 has been implicated in the conversion of F‐actin to globular actin (G‐actin), leading to cell–cell detachment. Thus, while the complete substrate motif for NUAK2 is still being clarified, its functional specificity is clearly linked to substrates that integrate stress, cytoskeletal reorganization, and proliferative signals (faisal2020developmentandtherapeutic pages 6-7, vis2021nuak1andnuak2 pages 7-8).

5. Structure  
NUAK2 is a protein of approximately 70 kDa that is composed of several distinct structural elements. At its N‑terminus, NUAK2 contains a highly conserved catalytic kinase domain typical of the AMPK–related kinases. This domain comprises all 11 conserved catalytic subdomains—including an ATP–binding region and an activation loop (T‑loop) containing a key threonine residue that must be phosphorylated for full activation by upstream kinases such as LKB1 (minchenko2012snf1ampactivatedproteinkinases pages 3-5, faisal2020developmentandtherapeutic pages 2-3). Structural models predict that NUAK2 follows the classical bilobal architecture observed in protein kinases: a smaller N‑terminal lobe dedicated primarily to ATP binding, and a larger C‑terminal lobe that participates in substrate binding. Embedded within the kinase domain are structural features such as a C‑helix that is vital for the proper alignment of catalytic residues and the assembly of a hydrophobic spine that underpins catalytic activity. Downstream of the catalytic domain, NUAK2 has less well‐conserved regions that likely contribute to substrate specificity and protein–protein interactions. Notably, NUAK2 contains a nuclear localization signal, for example the conserved motif “KKAR” (residues approximately 68–71), which facilitates its trafficking into the nucleus where it may regulate nuclear signaling events (minchenko2012snf1ampactivatedproteinkinases pages 5-8, faisal2020developmentandtherapeutic pages 3-4). These structural features, derived from both crystallographic data on related AMPK kinases and predictive modeling, underscore the dual role of NUAK2 in both the cytoplasm and nucleus.

6. Regulation  
The activity of NUAK2 is tightly regulated by multiple mechanisms that include both post-translational modifications and transcriptional controls. A primary regulatory event is the phosphorylation of a conserved threonine residue in its activation loop by the upstream kinase LKB1, a modification required for full activation of NUAK2’s catalytic function (faisal2020developmentandtherapeutic pages 6-7, vis2021nuak1andnuak2 pages 2-3). Once phosphorylated, NUAK2 can further autophosphorylate, which may stabilize its active conformation. In addition to these classical activation steps, NUAK2 expression is upregulated in response to cellular stress. Pro-inflammatory stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and CD95 (Fas receptor) activation result in the transcriptional induction of NUAK2 through the NF-κB signaling pathway, thereby enhancing its expression in various tumor environments (bonnard2020alossoffunctionnuak2 pages 1-2, faisal2020developmentandtherapeutic pages 15-17). Furthermore, NUAK2 directly phosphorylates components of the Hippo pathway—specifically LATS1 and LATS2—resulting in regulation of YAP1 localization and activity; this feedback loop is critical for controlling cell proliferation and tissue morphogenesis (vis2021nuak1andnuak2 pages 12-14). Regulatory inputs from other signaling pathways, including those involved in metabolic stress and cell adhesion, may also contribute to dynamic modulation of NUAK2 activity, although these are less well characterized. In sum, NUAK2 is regulated by a combination of upstream kinase activity (primarily LKB1), autophosphorylation, and transcriptional induction in response to stress signals, all of which converge to modulate its impact on downstream substrates.

7. Function  
NUAK2 functions primarily as a stress-activated serine/threonine kinase that plays a multifaceted role in the regulation of cellular homeostasis under conditions of metabolic and environmental stress. One of its best characterized roles is in the cellular tolerance to glucose starvation; NUAK2 is induced when cells experience nutrient deprivation, thereby helping to sustain energy homeostasis in harsh conditions (bonnard2020alossoffunctionnuak2 pages 1-2, faisal2020developmentandtherapeutic pages 21-22). In addition, NUAK2 has a marked impact on the actin cytoskeleton—it promotes the depolymerization of filamentous actin (F‑actin) into globular actin (G‑actin), leading to cell–cell detachment. This cytoskeletal reorganization is an essential process in the detachment and increased motility of tumor cells, particularly following stimulation by death receptor signals such as those from CD95 (Fas) and TNF-α (bonnard2020alossoffunctionnuak2 pages 1-2, faisal2020developmentandtherapeutic pages 7-8). Moreover, NUAK2 protects cells from CD95-mediated apoptosis, thereby enhancing cell survival under conditions that would otherwise trigger programmed cell death—a property that contributes to the invasiveness and metastatic potential of CD95-activated tumor cells (faisal2020developmentandtherapeutic pages 19-20, vis2021nuak1andnuak2 pages 10-12). A critical developmental function of NUAK2 is evident in its role in embryogenesis, particularly in neural tube closure. By phosphorylating LATS1 and LATS2, NUAK2 regulates the nuclear localization of YAP1, a key transcriptional coactivator in the Hippo signaling pathway. This regulation is crucial for proper neural tube formation, and loss-of-function mutations in NUAK2 have been associated with neural tube defects such as anencephaly (bonnard2020alossoffunctionnuak2 pages 1-2, faisal2020developmentandtherapeutic pages 21-22). Collectively, these functions underscore the dual role of NUAK2 in both promoting cell survival under stress and regulating cytoskeletal dynamics and developmental processes.

8. Other Comments  
Several small-molecule inhibitors have been developed that target the NUAK family of kinases, including NUAK2, with compounds such as WZ4003 demonstrating inhibitory activity in the low nanomolar range. WZ4003, for instance, inhibits NUAK2 with an approximate IC₅₀ of 100 nM, although these inhibitors are not fully selective and often inhibit NUAK1 as well (banerjee2014characterizationofwz4003 pages 1-2). At present, there is no inhibitor that is exclusively selective for NUAK2, and this has prompted ongoing medicinal chemistry efforts to develop more specific agents. NUAK2 gene amplifications have been observed in certain cancers, such as acral melanoma and glioblastoma, which may drive tumor progression through enhanced cell motility, invasiveness, and resistance to apoptosis (monteverde2015evidenceofcancer‐promoting pages 7-8, zagorska2010newrolesfor pages 1-2). Moreover, the regulatory role of NUAK2 in Hippo signaling—via phosphorylation of LATS1 and LATS2 and subsequent modulation of YAP1—links it to developmental abnormalities including neural tube closure defects. These observations highlight the potential of NUAK2 as a therapeutic target in both oncology and developmental disorders. Recent work has also implicated NUAK2 in the phosphorylation of proteins in muscle tissue, as shown by the identification of CryAB as a NUAK kinase target in Drosophila, suggesting broader roles in proteostasis and stress response (zhao2023identificationofcryab pages 14-14). Finally, upstream regulators such as LKB1 and pro-inflammatory pathways (TNF-α, CD95/NF-κB) underscore the complex regulatory network in which NUAK2 operates, further emphasizing the need to understand its precise molecular interactions and develop targeted interventions (huang2022liverkinaseb1 pages 13-14).
