1. Phylogeny  
Serine/threonine‐protein kinase PDIK1L is a conserved member of the eukaryotic protein kinase superfamily. Sequence analysis from molecular cloning studies demonstrated that the 341–amino acid protein shares 69% identity with the related kinase CLIK1 and displays measurable sequence similarity with other kinases—including a 27% identity with mouse STK33—which confirms its placement within the canonical group of serine/threonine kinases (guo2003molecularcloningand pages 3-6). In addition, comparative analyses and phylogenetic reconstructions have indicated that PDIK1L belongs to a distinct subgroup; several studies employing multiple sequence alignments and evolutionary tree construction (using methods such as Neighbor Joining) have placed PDIK1L in a unique branch within the kinome, sometimes reported as part of a novel kinase family (NKF4) in conjunction with its paralog STK35 (goyal2009identifyingandcharacterizing pages 13-14). Broader kinome screening efforts have classified PDIK1L under the “Other” or “Atypical” kinase category, a grouping that underscores both its conserved catalytic features and its evolutionary divergence from the major kinase families such as AGC, CAMK, or CMGC (sekigawa2010comprehensivescreeningof pages 5-5). Orthologs of PDIK1L have been detected across chordates and vertebrates, reinforcing its early emergence in metazoan evolution and underlining an evolutionary conservation that is typical of enzymes playing essential regulatory roles.  

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
PDIK1L catalyzes a phosphate transfer reaction typical of serine/threonine kinases. The chemical reaction it mediates can be summarized as follows:  
  ATP + [protein] – (L‐serine or L‐threonine) → ADP + [protein] – (L‐serine/threonine)‐phosphate + H⁺  
This reaction involves the transfer of the γ‐phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins, thereby modifying their activity or interactions through phosphorylation (guo2003molecularcloningand pages 3-6).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
Like most serine/threonine kinases, the catalytic activity of PDIK1L depends on divalent metal ions, with Mg²⁺ serving as an essential cofactor. The binding of Mg²⁺ facilitates ATP coordination within the catalytic site, enabling the proper alignment of the phosphate group for transfer to the substrate’s hydroxyl group. Although specific experimental dissection for PDIK1L is not detailed in the primary cloning report, its conserved kinase domain implies a cofactor requirement that is consistent with the canonical requirements for serine/threonine phosphorylation reactions (guo2003molecularcloningand pages 3-6).

4. Substrate Specificity  
The substrate specificity of PDIK1L has been inferred from its domain structure and sequence conservation rather than from direct biochemical assays. The kinase domain of PDIK1L incorporates canonical features—such as the ATP-binding motif (residues 120–144) and the catalytic active site (residues 270–282)—that are indicative of its function in phosphorylating serine/threonine residues. Despite the conservation of these motifs, no experimental consensus substrate motif or detailed mapping of amino acid preferences has been reported in the available literature. Based on its high sequence similarity to CLIK1, which interacts with PDZ-LIM domain proteins, it is anticipated that PDIK1L may target substrates possessing serine/threonine residues embedded within specific sequence contexts; however, the precise consensus remains to be established through directed substrate‐profiling experiments (guo2003molecularcloningand pages 3-6).

5. Structure  
The domain organization of PDIK1L is characteristic of serine/threonine kinases. The protein contains a central catalytic domain that spans approximately residues 8 to 334, within which several conserved motifs reside. Key among these are the ATP-binding region, located between residues 120 and 144, and the catalytic active site, situated between residues 270 and 282. These regions are responsible for ATP binding and phosphate transfer activity, respectively, and are conserved among the eukaryotic kinase superfamily (guo2003molecularcloningand pages 3-6). In addition, PDIK1L has been observed to localize predominantly to the nucleus, as evidenced by GFP-fusion localization studies in COS7 cells. Although no high-resolution crystal structures or AlphaFold models have been reported in the available peer-reviewed literature, the architectural features inferred from its amino acid sequence suggest that PDIK1L adopts the typical bilobal kinase fold. The N-terminal lobe is expected to contain a five-stranded β-sheet along with the conserved glycine-rich loop for ATP binding, whereas the larger C-terminal lobe harbors the catalytic segments, including the activation loop, which in many kinases is involved in determining the active conformation. No additional noncatalytic regulatory domains have been unambiguously identified in the published reports; however, its nomenclature (PDLIM1-interacting kinase 1-like) implies potential regions for protein–protein interaction that might mediate associations with PDZ and LIM domain-containing binding partners (guo2003molecularcloningand pages 3-6, sekigawa2010comprehensivescreeningof pages 5-5).

6. Regulation  
The regulation of PDIK1L, as deduced from its structural features and sequence conservation, is expected to parallel that of canonical serine/threonine kinases. The highly conserved kinase catalytic domain suggests that activation typically involves phosphorylation events within the activation loop. Although the initial cloning study did not report detailed post-translational modification mapping for PDIK1L, the presence of conserved residues essential for kinase activation implies that phosphorylation is likely to function as the primary regulatory mechanism. In several serine/threonine kinases, modifications at residues near the catalytic cleft can switch the enzyme between an inactive “DFG-out” conformation and an active “DFG-in” state. In the case of PDIK1L, the preservation of these motifs hints at similar conformational dynamics. In addition, the nuclear localization of PDIK1L, as demonstrated in cellular localization assays, represents an additional regulatory aspect that may restrict the kinase’s activity to specific subnuclear compartments where its substrates reside. Furthermore, its close sequence relationship with CLIK1 suggests that PDIK1L may interact with PDZ-LIM domain proteins, which in other systems are known to modulate kinase activity through direct binding, thus possibly serving as both scaffolds and regulators of its catalytic function (guo2003molecularcloningand pages 3-6).

7. Function  
The biological role of PDIK1L has been primarily elucidated through molecular cloning and expression profiling studies. The gene encoding PDIK1L was originally isolated from a human fetal brain cDNA library, indicating that it is expressed during early stages of human development. Further expression analysis using multiple-tissue cDNA panels revealed that PDIK1L mRNA is widely distributed, with prominent expression in the liver, kidney, pancreas, spleen, thymus, and prostate; weaker expression has also been noted in tissues such as the placenta, heart, and brain (guo2003molecularcloningand pages 1-3). Subcellular localization experiments employing a GFP fusion protein in COS7 cells have consistently demonstrated a predominantly nuclear localization for PDIK1L, which is in line with the idea that it may participate in nuclear signaling pathways or regulate the phosphorylation state of nuclear substrates. Based on its 69% sequence identity with CLIK1—previously implicated in interactions with PDZ and LIM domain proteins—PDIK1L is predicted to engage in similar protein–protein interactions, thereby contributing to the assembly of multiprotein complexes that could regulate cytoskeletal organization, transcriptional machinery, or other nuclear events. Moreover, phylogenetic studies have placed PDIK1L in a conserved niche within the kinome, underscoring its potential role in essential cell-signaling pathways that are maintained across vertebrate evolution (goyal2009identifyingandcharacterizing pages 13-14, guo2003molecularcloningand pages 3-6). Although direct upstream or downstream interacting partners beyond the predicted PDZ-LIM proteins have not been fully characterized in the cited studies, the overall expression pattern and nuclear distribution suggest that PDIK1L may serve as a nexus for signal transduction processes that coordinate cell growth, differentiation, or stress responses.  

8. Other Comments  
To date, PDIK1L has been relatively undercharacterized compared to more extensively studied serine/threonine kinases. Classified under the “Other” kinase group by comprehensive screening efforts, its designation as PDLIM1-interacting kinase 1-like highlights the anticipated association with PDZ and LIM domain–containing proteins—a relationship that may be critical for subcellular targeting and regulatory control. No specific chemical inhibitors or detailed disease-associated mutations have been reported in the primary peer-reviewed studies. Instead, the initial cloning and characterization efforts have laid the groundwork for understanding its fundamental biochemical properties, such as a conserved catalytic domain and a nuclear localization signal. These foundational observations suggest that future studies aimed at elucidating PDIK1L’s substrate specificity, interaction networks, and post-translational modification patterns may uncover its potential involvement in physiological processes or pathologies. Notably, while additional publications have investigated its role in contexts such as acute myeloid leukemia and metabolic regulation, such data originate from sources that are not peer reviewed or are published in journals classified as “Unknown” and are therefore not included in this nomenclature. Consequently, the current profile relies on the rigorously peer-reviewed work from Guo et al. (2003), Goyal et al. (2009), and Sekigawa et al. (2010).
