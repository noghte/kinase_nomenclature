1. Phylogeny  
Phosphatidylinositol 4‐kinase beta (PI4KB), encoded by the gene PI4KB (also known as PIK4CB and alternatively designated as NPIK, PI4K92, or PI4KIII), is a member of the type III phosphatidylinositol 4‐kinase family that is evolutionarily conserved across eukaryotes (burke2014structuresofpi4kiiiβ pages 1-2). Orthologs of PI4KB can be identified from yeast—where the well‐characterized homolog Pik1 plays analogous roles in phosphoinositide metabolism—through to mammalian species, demonstrating that the core catalytic components and regulatory features have been maintained since the divergence of these lineages (clayton2013phosphatidylinositol4kinasesand pages 1-2). Comparative analyses reveal that PI4KB shares sequence and domain architecture similarities with other lipid kinases, including those in the PI3K family, although its substrate specificity clearly distinguishes its function (minogue2018themanyroles pages 22-24). Phylogenetic studies based on large-scale kinase classifications assign PI4KB to an evolutionary lineage that emerged in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA), underscoring its pivotal role in the regulation of membrane identity and trafficking through the generation of phosphoinositide signals (burke2014structuresofpi4kiiiβ pages 1-2). The structural motifs necessary for PI4KB’s catalytic activity, including the conserved kinase domain, have been retained in orthologs from diverse taxa, suggesting that both the catalytic mechanism and regulatory interactions with proteins such as Rab11 and ACBD3 are ancient features (clayton2013phosphatidylinositol4kinasesand pages 2-4). In addition, the presence of unique insertion sequences within the kinase domain that mediate interactions with small GTPases and other regulators indicates that while the overall fold is conserved, specialized functions have evolved in higher eukaryotes (burke2014structuresofpi4kiiiβ pages 8-11). Thus, the phylogenetic context of PI4KB places it among a core set of lipid kinases that are essential for phosphoinositide signaling and membrane morphology in a wide range of organisms (minogue2018themanyroles pages 22-24).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
PI4KB catalyzes the ATP‐dependent phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) at the D‐4 position of the inositol ring, thereby producing phosphatidylinositol 4‐phosphate (PI4P) (stevenson1998aphosphatidylinositol4kinase pages 1-2). In this reaction, ATP serves as the phosphate donor, and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) is released concomitantly with the generation of PI4P and the liberation of a proton (stevenson1998aphosphatidylinositol4kinase pages 1-2). This reaction constitutes the first committed step in the biosynthesis of inositol phosphates, ultimately leading to the generation of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) and other critical phosphoinositide derivatives that serve as versatile second messengers in cellular signaling (stevenson1998aphosphatidylinositol4kinase pages 1-2).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The enzymatic activity of PI4KB is dependent on divalent cations, with magnesium ions (Mg²⁺) being the primary cofactor required for catalysis (tai2011ahomogeneousand pages 1-2). Mg²⁺ facilitates the proper positioning of ATP in the catalytic pocket and is essential for coordinating the phosphoryl transfer reaction (tai2011ahomogeneousand pages 1-2). In certain in vitro conditions, additional divalent cations such as Mn²⁺ may substitute for Mg²⁺, although Mg²⁺ is considered physiologically relevant (tai2011ahomogeneousand pages 1-2).

4. Substrate Specificity  
The substrate specificity of PI4KB is directed primarily toward phosphatidylinositol (PI), which is embedded within cellular membranes (mejdrova2017rationaldesignof pages 27-31). PI4KB specifically phosphorylates the hydroxyl group at the D‐4 position of the inositol ring, resulting in the production of PI4P that functions as a key determinant of membrane identity (burke2014structuresofpi4kiiiβ pages 1-2). Although the enzyme does not recognize a linear polypeptide substrate motif as seen in many protein kinases, its specificity is defined by the interaction with the lipid substrate present in a membrane context, where the physicochemical properties of the surrounding lipids can modulate the efficiency of the kinase reaction (mejdrova2017rationaldesignof pages 27-31). This high degree of substrate selectivity ensures that the generation of PI4P is tightly regulated spatially and temporally within the cell (burke2014structuresofpi4kiiiβ pages 8-11).

5. Structure  
PI4KB exhibits a bilobal kinase domain typical of lipid kinases, characterized by a distinct N‐lobe and C‐lobe that together form the catalytic core (burke2014structuresofpi4kiiiβ pages 1-2). A unique feature of PI4KB is the presence of an insertion within the N‐lobe that is implicated in mediating interactions with small GTPases such as Rab11, which facilitate its recruitment to specific membrane compartments (burke2014structuresofpi4kiiiβ pages 2-4). In addition, the enzyme contains regulatory regions and membrane-targeting motifs, including palmitoylation sites that ensure its peripheral association with the Golgi apparatus (graaf2004phosphatidylinositol4kinaseβis pages 10-10). High-resolution crystallographic analyses and complementary structural models have revealed that the ATP-binding pocket is situated near the membrane interface, thereby positioning the phosphoryl donor optimally for catalysis (baumlova2014thecrystalstructure pages 7-9). Furthermore, the overall folding of PI4KB is supported by hydrophobic spines and a conserved C-helix, structural elements that are crucial for kinase activity and the maintenance of the active conformation (rutaganira2016designandstructural pages 1-3). These structural features, combined with flexible loops and regions predisposed to regulation by protein-protein interactions, underscore the capacity of PI4KB to integrate multiple signals that control its localization and catalytic efficiency (rutaganira2016designandstructural pages 14-15).

6. Regulation  
The activity of PI4KB is modulated by several regulatory mechanisms that include protein-protein interactions, post-translational modifications, and conformational changes induced by binding partners (mcphail2020characterizationofthe pages 15-16). One key regulatory interaction involves the binding of Rab11, a small GTPase, which governs the recruitment of PI4KB to the Golgi membranes and thereby influences the spatial generation of PI4P (burke2014structuresofpi4kiiiβ pages 8-11). In addition, the scaffolding protein ACBD3 plays a critical role in tethering PI4KB to the Golgi apparatus, ensuring that the kinase is localized at sites where its lipid product is required for membrane trafficking processes (graaf2004phosphatidylinositol4kinaseβis pages 10-10). Phosphorylation is another important regulatory mechanism; for example, studies have documented that protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates PI4KB at specific sites such as Ser496, modulating its interaction with regulatory proteins like c10orf76, without significantly impacting the basal kinase activity (mcphail2020characterizationofthe pages 15-16). Such phosphorylation events serve primarily to fine-tune the affinity of PI4KB for its accessory proteins rather than to control catalytic turnover directly (mcphail2020characterizationofthe pages 5-6). Furthermore, viral proteins, particularly those from hepatitis C virus and picornaviruses, can hijack PI4KB by binding to its regulatory domains, leading to aberrant upregulation of PI4P synthesis that supports the formation of replication organelles (burke2014structuresofpi4kiiiβ pages 1-2, clayton2013phosphatidylinositol4kinasesand pages 2-4). These multifaceted regulatory inputs ensure that PI4KB activity is dynamically adjusted in response to diverse cellular signals and stress conditions (rutaganira2016designandstructural pages 15-16).

7. Function  
The primary function of PI4KB is to catalyze the synthesis of PI4P, a lipid that serves as an essential “biological address” for defining the identity of membrane compartments such as the Golgi apparatus and the trans-Golgi network (stevenson1998aphosphatidylinositol4kinase pages 1-2, clayton2013phosphatidylinositol4kinasesand pages 9-10). PI4P generated by PI4KB facilitates Golgi-to-plasma membrane trafficking by recruiting specific effector proteins and lipid transfer proteins that mediate vesicular transport (graaf2004phosphatidylinositol4kinaseβis pages 10-10). In addition, the enzyme has been implicated in the regulation of Golgi structural integrity during cell division by contributing to the disintegration and subsequent reorganization of the Golgi complex (stevenson1998aphosphatidylinositol4kinase pages 1-2). Emerging evidence also suggests a role in inner ear development, where precise control of phosphoinositide signaling is critical for proper organogenesis (pagnamenta2015germlinerecessivemutations pages 9-10). Furthermore, PI4KB is exploited by several positive-sense RNA viruses—including hepatitis C virus, poliovirus, coxsackievirus, and rhinovirus—to generate PI4P-enriched membrane platforms that serve as replication compartments (burke2014structuresofpi4kiiiβ pages 1-2, minogue2018themanyroles pages 22-24). Tissue expression studies indicate that PI4KB is ubiquitously expressed with higher levels in cells engaged in active secretion and membrane trafficking, such as hepatocytes and neuronal cells (waugh2014amplificationofchromosome pages 1-2, clayton2013phosphatidylinositol4kinasesand pages 9-10). The centrality of PI4KB in coordinating lipid signaling and vesicular transport pathways highlights its importance in cellular homeostasis and intracellular communication (clayton2013phosphatidylinositol4kinasesand pages 2-4).

8. Other Comments  
Several small molecule inhibitors have been developed that target the ATP-binding pocket of PI4KB, and these inhibitors serve as useful chemical biology tools as well as potential antiviral agents (humpolickova2017fluorescentinhibitorsas pages 7-8, mejdrova2017rationaldesignof pages 27-31). For instance, compounds such as T-00127-HEV1 and PIK93 have been shown to inhibit PI4KB activity with submicromolar potency, thereby blocking viral replication in cellular models (mejdrova2017rationaldesignof pages 27-31, rutaganira2016designandstructural pages 15-16). In addition to antiviral applications, dysregulation of PI4KB has been associated with altered Golgi morphology and aberrant membrane trafficking, and its gene amplification has been observed in certain cancers, suggesting a broader role in disease pathogenesis (waugh2014amplificationofchromosome pages 4-6, pagnamenta2015germlinerecessivemutations pages 9-10). Although specific disease-associated mutations in PI4KB are not extensively documented, the profound impact of viral hijacking on its activity highlights the potential for targeting this enzyme in antiviral strategies and possibly in other pathological conditions where PI4P metabolism is disrupted (mohamed2020noveldefectin pages 22-26). Ongoing efforts in structure-based drug design have further elucidated the atomic interactions within the kinase active site, paving the way for the development of next-generation inhibitors with improved selectivity and potency (rutaganira2016designandstructural pages 16-22). These inhibitors not only provide insights into the mechanistic basis of PI4KB function but also represent promising candidates for therapeutic intervention in diseases driven by dysregulated phosphoinositide signaling (humpolickova2017fluorescentinhibitorsas pages 7-8).
