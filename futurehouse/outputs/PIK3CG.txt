1. Phylogeny  
PIK3CG encodes the catalytic subunit p110γ, which is a member of the class I phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) and is exclusively grouped within the Class IB subgroup. Unlike Class IA isoforms that require p85 regulatory subunits and are activated primarily by receptor tyrosine kinases, p110γ evolved to interact with distinct regulatory proteins (p101 or p84) and is activated downstream of G-protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) (brown2011phylogenomicsofphosphoinositide pages 1-3). Phylogenetic analyses indicate that PIK3CG is highly conserved among mammalian species and vertebrates, reflecting its critical role in mediating immune and inflammatory signaling. Its evolution involves diversification events that occurred in early deuterostomes and subsequently in cold-blooded vertebrates and mammals, thereby establishing a distinct set of regulatory mechanisms compared with its Class IA counterparts (brown2011phylogenomicsofphosphoinositide pages 8-9, rathinaswamy2021molecularbasisfor pages 11-14). Observations from comparative kinome analyses place p110γ among a core set of kinases whose evolutionary origin can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes, highlighting both its conservation and the unique adaptive changes that allowed its specialization within the cellular immune responses (rathinaswamy2021molecularbasisfor pages 11-14).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
The primary catalytic reaction of PIK3CG is the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2]. In this reaction, ATP is utilized as the phosphate donor to transfer the γ-phosphate to PI(4,5)P2, yielding phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate [PI(3,4,5)P3] while producing ADP and releasing an H⁺ ion. The reaction can be formally represented as:  
  ATP + PI(4,5)P2 → ADP + PI(3,4,5)P3 + H⁺  
This reaction is central to PI3K signaling and underlies the recruitment of pleckstrin homology (PH) domain–containing effector proteins to the plasma membrane (botindari2015targetingship1and pages 26-29, burke2018structuralbasisfor pages 2-2).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The kinase activity of PIK3CG depends on the presence of ATP as the phosphate donor and requires magnesium ions (Mg²⁺) as a critical cofactor for its catalytic mechanism. The requirement for Mg²⁺ is typical for kinases and is essential for stabilizing the negative charges on the phosphate groups of ATP, thus facilitating the transfer of the phosphate to the inositol ring of the substrate (durrant2020pi3kinhibitorsin pages 3-5, botindari2015targetingship1and pages 26-29).

4. Substrate Specificity  
PIK3CG exhibits high substrate specificity toward phosphatidylinositol lipids. Its principal substrate in vivo is phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2], which is phosphorylated at the D3 position of the inositol ring to generate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate [PI(3,4,5)P3]. This specificity is defined by the structural determinants within its catalytic domain, including unique arginine and lysine residues that interact with the negatively charged phosphate groups of the PI(4,5)P2 headgroup. These interactions ensure that PI(4,5)P2 is preferentially recognized and converted into PI(3,4,5)P3, a reaction that is critical for the subsequent recruitment of PH domain–containing effector proteins (alli2017thecellularfunctions pages 28-31, botindari2015targetingship1and pages 26-29).

5. Structure  
PIK3CG (p110γ) exhibits a modular architecture that comprises several distinct domains responsible for both catalytic and regulatory functions. The overall domain organization includes an N-terminal region which, unlike Class IA PI3Ks, does not bind p85 regulatory subunits, followed by a Ras-binding domain (RBD) that facilitates interaction with small GTPases such as Ras. Adjacent to the RBD is a C2 domain that mediates binding to membrane phospholipids, thereby aiding in the recruitment of the enzyme to cellular membranes where its substrate resides. Following the C2 domain, p110γ contains an α-helical domain that plays a role in stabilizing the overall structure and mediating interactions with regulatory subunits p101 or p84, which confer stimulus specificity (błajecka2012activationregulationand pages 104-107, burke2018structuralbasisfor pages 5-6).  
At its C-terminus, p110γ includes a bi-lobal kinase domain typically divided into N- and C-lobes; this catalytic core harbors the active site where ATP coordination and phosphotransfer occur. Within the kinase domain, features such as the activation loop and hydrophobic spines are critical for kinase activation, while the C-helix contributes to the proper orientation of catalytic residues for efficient substrate binding and catalysis. The structural design of p110γ enables it to undergo conformational changes upon binding to upstream activators such as Gβγ subunits or Ras, thus aligning its catalytic machinery for effective phosphorylation of PI(4,5)P2 (burke2018structuralbasisfor pages 5-6, rathinaswamy2021molecularbasisfor pages 6-11). Moreover, structural studies have revealed that p110γ maintains an inactive conformation in the absence of activating signals, and its association with regulatory subunits induces rearrangements that expose the active site for substrate turnover. Unique among the PI3K family is the absence of a classic p85-binding domain, which underscores the distinct regulatory and structural mechanisms that govern its activity relative to Class IA PI3Ks (błajecka2012activationregulationand pages 104-107, rathinaswamy2021molecularbasisfor pages 11-14).

6. Regulation  
The regulation of PIK3CG involves multiple integrated mechanisms that ensure its activity is tightly controlled in response to extracellular signals. A principal regulatory mechanism is its activation downstream of G-protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs). Upon ligand binding to a GPCR, heterotrimeric G proteins become activated and dissociate into Gα and Gβγ subunits; the Gβγ subunits directly interact with p110γ or with its associated regulatory subunits (p101 or p84), facilitating its recruitment to the plasma membrane where its substrate, PI(4,5)P2, is located (botindari2015targetingship1and pages 26-29, burke2018structuralbasisfor pages 5-6).  
In addition to Gβγ-mediated activation, the Ras-binding domain (RBD) of p110γ enables further stimulation by small GTPases. Ras interaction with the RBD provides an additive signal that promotes membrane localization and full activation, particularly in complexes where the weak regulatory subunit p84 is involved (błajecka2012activationregulationand pages 19-22, prasad2022understandingthemolecular pages 23-27). This dual input from GPCR-derived Gβγ and Ras ensures that p110γ is only fully activated in the presence of a convergent signal — a regulatory strategy that is critical for signal fidelity in immune cells.  
Post-translational modifications also play an important role in modulating p110γ activity. For instance, phosphorylation events mediated by protein kinase C beta (PKCβ), particularly at serine residues located within or near the helical domain, can allosterically modulate the catalytic activity of p110γ (prasad2022understandingthemolecular pages 23-27, rathinaswamy2021molecularbasisfor pages 17-20). These phosphorylation events sometimes induce conformational changes that either enhance the enzyme’s catalytic efficiency or facilitate the displacement of regulatory subunits, thereby fine-tuning the production of PI(3,4,5)P3.  
The regulatory subunits themselves—p101 and p84—confer additional layers of control by modulating the enzyme’s sensitivity to Gβγ subunits and possibly defining distinct activation thresholds in different cell types. The p101 subunit, which is abundantly expressed in neutrophils, substantially increases p110γ responsiveness to Gβγ, while the p84-containing complex requires additional signals from Ras for full activation (błajecka2012activationregulationand pages 19-22, dalwadi2021biochemicalandstructural pages 164-168, rathinaswamy2021molecularbasisfor pages 17-20). Collectively, these mechanisms of regulation – via direct interactions with Gβγ, engagement of Ras and post-translational modifications – enable PIK3CG to act as a finely tuned molecular switch that integrates diverse extracellular cues into precise lipid kinase activity (botindari2015targetingship1and pages 26-29, prasad2022understandingthemolecular pages 23-27).

7. Function  
The primary biological function of PIK3CG is to generate the lipid second messenger phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate [PI(3,4,5)P3] through the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. The production of PI(3,4,5)P3 is essential for the recruitment and activation of a variety of effector proteins that contain pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, such as AKT1 and PDPK1, thereby triggering downstream signaling pathways that govern cell growth, survival, proliferation, and metabolism (botindari2015targetingship1and pages 26-29, burke2018structuralbasisfor pages 1-2).  
PIK3CG is expressed predominantly in immune cells, including white blood cells, mast cells, neutrophils, dendritic cells, T lymphocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells. In these cells, p110γ plays a pivotal role in mediating chemotaxis; it controls leukocyte polarization and migration by regulating the spatial accumulation of PI(3,4,5)P3. This in turn influences the organization of F-actin and integrin-based adhesion at the leading edge of migrating cells, thereby directing immune cell movement toward inflammatory sites and contributing to the orchestration of immune responses (botindari2015targetingship1and pages 38-40, song2017theroleof pages 77-82, dalwadi2021biochemicalandstructural pages 55-58).  
Furthermore, PIK3CG is involved in modulating allergic responses and inflammation. Its activity is critical for mast cell degranulation, a process that underlies many allergic reactions, as well as for the chemotactic migration of leukocytes in response to chemoattractant agents such as chemokines (prasad2022understandingthemolecular pages 14-19, song2017theroleofa pages 77-82). In addition to these immune functions, PIK3CG contributes to the regulation of cell morphology and motility by controlling the dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and by influencing integrin-mediated adhesion, further underscoring its role in cellular responses to external stimuli (dalwadi2021biochemicalandstructural pages 55-58, prasad2022understandingthemolecular pages 14-19).  
The recruitment of PH domain–containing proteins by PI(3,4,5)P3 is a central event in multiple signaling cascades, linking GPCR activation directly to metabolic and survival pathways. This mechanism is also critical for the development and function of dendritic cells, natural killer cells, and T-lymphocytes, where appropriate migration and activation are essential for proper immune surveillance and host defense (botindari2015targetingship1and pages 26-29, song2017theroleofa pages 73-77). Thus, through its catalytic activity and strategic localization at the plasma membrane, PIK3CG serves as a linchpin in the signal transduction networks that coordinate immune, inflammatory, and allergic responses.

8. Other Comments  
Several experimental inhibitors targeting PI3Kγ have been developed to modulate its role in immune and inflammatory diseases, as well as in certain cancers where aberrant PI3K signaling contributes to tumor progression. Inhibitors such as IPI-549 have been designed to selectively inhibit p110γ activity with high potency and are currently under clinical investigation due to their potential to enhance anti-tumor immunity (durrant2020pi3kinhibitorsin pages 3-5, rathinaswamy2021molecularbasisfor pages 116-119).  
Beyond pharmacological inhibition, mutation analyses have highlighted the potential of PIK3CG as a therapeutic target. Aberrant PIK3CG signaling has been linked to dysregulated immune responses, contributing to diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, and certain types of cancer. Loss-of-function mutations in PIK3CG may be associated with immunodeficiency states, whereas gain-of-function alterations could promote oncogenic signaling through excessive PI(3,4,5)P3 production (prasad2022understandingthemolecular pages 14-19, rathinaswamy2021molecularbasisfor pages 107-109).  
Furthermore, studies underscore the importance of the regulatory subunits p101 and p84 in dictating p110γ activation in different cellular contexts. These regulatory interactions not only determine the magnitude and kinetics of PI3Kγ activity but also influence its subcellular localization and downstream signaling specificity, suggesting that interventions targeting these protein–protein interactions may yield additional therapeutic benefits (błajecka2012activationregulationand pages 19-22, dalwadi2021biochemicalandstructural pages 164-168).  
Collectively, the body of evidence underscores PIK3CG’s therapeutic potential across a range of inflammatory and immune-mediated pathologies, and current research continues to refine its inhibitor profiles while exploring the full spectrum of its disease associations (durrant2020pi3kinhibitorsin pages 3-5, prasad2022understandingthemolecular pages 14-19).
