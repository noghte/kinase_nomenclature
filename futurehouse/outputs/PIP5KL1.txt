1. Phylogeny  
Phosphatidylinositol 4‐phosphate 5‐kinase‐like protein 1 (PIP5KL1) is classified within the type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase (PIPK) family. Sequence analyses and phylogenomic studies have demonstrated that type I PIP kinases are evolutionarily conserved across metazoans, with ancestral gene duplication events in early vertebrate evolution giving rise to multiple isoforms, including PIP5K1A, PIP5K1B, and PIP5KL1 (shi2010overexpressionofpip5kl1 pages 1-2, brown2011phylogenomicsofphosphoinositide pages 1-3). Although PIP5KL1 shares homology with other catalytically active members of the family through a conserved central kinase domain, it has diverged such that it no longer exhibits full intrinsic catalytic activity. Instead, it appears to have evolved primarily to function as a regulatory scaffold. This divergence is documented in comparative kinome analyses showing that while most type I kinases retain both catalytic and regulatory functions, PIP5KL1 is set apart by truncations in conserved catalytic motifs, a feature that is consistent with its specialized role in modulating phosphoinositide metabolism rather than directly catalyzing phosphate transfer (shi2010overexpressionofpip5kl1 pages 1-2, brown2011phylogenomicsofphosphoinositide pages 3-4, scheeff2005structuralevolutionof pages 19-20).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
The canonical reaction catalyzed by type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases involves the transfer of a phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to phosphatidylinositol 4‐phosphate (PI(4)P), thereby generating phosphatidylinositol 4,5‐bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) and producing adenosine diphosphate (ADP) along with a proton (H⁺) as a by‐product. Although PIP5KL1 itself exhibits minimal intrinsic catalytic activity, it plays an essential role by serving as a scaffold to recruit and position active type I PIP kinases at distinct cellular compartments where they can perform the following reaction:  
  ATP + PI(4)P → ADP + PI(4,5)P2 + H⁺  
This reaction is fundamental to the production of PI(4,5)P2, which in turn is a precursor for PI(3,4,5)P3 synthesis and is crucial for orchestrating actin nucleation, membrane dynamics, and downstream signal transduction (bout2009pip5kdrivenptdins(45)p2synthesis pages 2-4, doughman2003phosphatidylinositolphosphatekinases pages 1-3).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The catalytic activity of type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases is generally dependent on divalent cations, with magnesium (Mg²⁺) being the essential cofactor. Mg²⁺ interacts with ATP in the active site, stabilizing the phosphoryl transfer reaction required for PI(4,5)P2 synthesis. Although PIP5KL1 itself does not display significant catalytic activity, it functions in close association with active kinases whose reactions require Mg²⁺ (doughman2003phosphatidylinositolphosphatekinases pages 1-3, hu2015resolutionofstructure pages 1-2, shi2010overexpressionofpip5kl1 pages 6-8).

4. Substrate Specificity  
Type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases exhibit a substrate specificity that favors the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4‐phosphate (PI(4)P) at the D5 hydroxyl position, resulting in the formation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5‐bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2). This specificity is largely dictated by conserved sequences within the enzyme’s activation loop, which contains consensus motifs responsible for recognizing the inositol ring of PI(4)P (bout2009pip5kdrivenptdins(45)p2synthesis pages 2-4, doughman2003phosphatidylinositolphosphatekinases pages 1-3). Although PIP5KL1 is not catalytically robust on its own, it retains structural features that allow it to associate with catalytically active type I PIP kinases, thereby indirectly ensuring that the correct lipid substrate, PI(4)P, is phosphorylated in a spatially controlled manner. This protein–protein interaction promotes the localized formation of PI(4,5)P2, which is critical for subsequent conversion into PI(3,4,5)P3 and the initiation of downstream signaling cascades (bout2009pip5kdrivenptdins(45)p2synthesis pages 2-4, doughman2003phosphatidylinositolphosphatekinases pages 1-3, shi2010overexpressionofpip5kl1 pages 9-10).

5. Structure  
PIP5KL1 contains a central kinase-like domain that is homologous to those found in catalytically active type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases; however, several key catalytic residues are missing, which accounts for its lack of robust kinase activity (shi2010overexpressionofpip5kl1 pages 1-2, doughman2003phosphatidylinositolphosphatekinases pages 1-3). In structurally characterized type I PIP kinases, the enzyme typically exhibits a two-lobe architecture comprising an N-terminal lobe that houses a glycine-rich loop for ATP binding and a C-terminal lobe that contains the activation loop, a conserved lysine essential for catalysis, and additional residues implicated in substrate binding and membrane association. Although no direct high-resolution structure of PIP5KL1 has been reported, homology modeling based on related kinases such as PIP5K1A suggests that PIP5KL1 adopts a similar overall fold with an incomplete catalytic core. This structural arrangement is consistent with its role as a scaffold: the preserved portions of the kinase-like domain facilitate interactions with other type I PIP kinases, enabling proper localization at the plasma membrane and specific intracellular compartments, while the absence of fully conserved catalytic motifs underlies its minimal intrinsic phosphotransfer capability (hu2015resolutionofstructure pages 1-2, shi2010overexpressionofpip5kl1 pages 1-2, scheeff2005structuralevolutionof pages 19-20).

6. Regulation  
Regulatory mechanisms governing PIP5KL1 function primarily involve its expression levels and its capacity to form complexes with catalytically active type I PIP kinases. In human gastric cancer cells, overexpression studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of PIP5KL1 correlate with a marked suppression of cell proliferation and migration; these effects are accompanied by a decrease in serum-induced AKT1 phosphorylation, indicating modulation of downstream signaling pathways (shi2010overexpressionofpip5kl1 pages 1-2, shi2010overexpressionofpip5kl1 pages 8-9). In hepatic systems, PIP5KL1 participates in protein–protein interactions with low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), which recruits PIP5K1β to the plasma membrane, thereby ensuring adequate synthesis of PI(4,5)P2. This localization is critical for maintaining phosphoinositide levels that support proper mitochondrial dynamics and lipid homeostasis (chinnarasu2021hepaticldlreceptorrelated pages 6-7, jaeschke2021ldlreceptorrelatedprotein pages 1-3). Overall, regulation of PIP5KL1 involves its ability to modulate the activity and spatial distribution of active kinases without undergoing significant post-translational modifications itself, as current reports do not detail specific phosphorylation or ubiquitination events on PIP5KL1 (shi2010overexpressionofpip5kl1 pages 6-8, jaeschke2021ldlreceptorrelatedprotein pages 3-4, wang2006cellbasedscreeningand pages 2-3).

7. Function  
PIP5KL1 plays a critical role as a scaffold protein within the phosphoinositide signaling cascade. Its primary function is to localize and regulate active type I PI(4)P 5-kinases at specific plasma membrane microdomains and other intracellular compartments, ensuring the localized generation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2). The production of PI(4,5)P2 is essential for numerous cellular processes, including actin nucleation, focal adhesion dynamics, and the generation of PI(3,4,5)P3 via phosphorylation by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), thereby linking PIP5KL1 to critical signal transduction pathways (bout2009pip5kdrivenptdins(45)p2synthesis pages 2-4, doughman2003phosphatidylinositolphosphatekinases pages 1-3). In human gastric cancer cells, overexpression of PIP5KL1 has been shown to suppress cell proliferation and migration, indicating a tumor suppressor role that is mediated through decreased AKT1 signaling (shi2010overexpressionofpip5kl1 pages 1-2, shi2010overexpressionofpip5kl1 pages 8-9). Furthermore, in liver cells, PIP5KL1 is implicated in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics through its interaction with LRP1, which facilitates the proper synthesis of PI(4,5)P2 necessary for maintaining organelle integrity (chinnarasu2021hepaticldlreceptorrelated pages 6-7, jaeschke2021ldlreceptorrelatedprotein pages 1-3). Expression studies in neural tissues have also identified PIP5KL1 as a brain-specific, kinase-dead isoform that is expressed during early postnatal development, suggesting a role in the regulation of neuronal morphology and adhesion (muzyka2018postnataldevelopmentaldynamics pages 28-29).

8. Other Comments  
To date, there are no reported small-molecule inhibitors that target PIP5KL1 specifically. The literature emphasizes its role as a regulatory scaffold rather than as a direct enzymatic catalyst, and consequently, research efforts have focused on its interactions with catalytically active type I PIP kinases rather than on its inhibition. In the context of disease, reduced PIP5KL1 expression has been associated with gastric cancer progression, supporting its potential tumor suppressor function. Additionally, in hepatocytes, aberrant function of PIP5KL1—as evidenced by its impaired interaction with LRP1—has been linked to altered mitochondrial dynamics and lipid metabolism, which may have ramifications in hepatic pathophysiology. Although detailed post-translational modification sites and mutational analyses have not been extensively described in the provided sources, the available data consistently indicate that PIP5KL1 serves as a key modulator of lipid kinase localization and activity without directly mediating catalytic function (shi2010overexpressionofpip5kl1 pages 1-2, chinnarasu2021hepaticldlreceptorrelated pages 6-7, wang2006cellbasedscreeningand pages 7-8).
