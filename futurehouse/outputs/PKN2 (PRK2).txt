1. Phylogeny  
Serine/threonine‐protein kinase N2 (PKN2), also designated as PRK2, is classified within the AGC kinase family and belongs to the PKN/PRK sub‐family, which also includes the isoforms PKN1 and PKN3. Orthologs of PKN2 are found across mammalian species, and sequence comparisons indicate that its catalytic domain shares approximately 87% similarity with PKN1 and around 70% with PKN3, whereas relatedness to classical PKC isoforms is lower, on the order of 50% (scott2020developmentofpkn2a pages 29-34). This conservation places PKN2 within a core evolutionary group of eukaryotic protein kinases that emerged early in evolution and have been maintained throughout the diversification of higher organisms (henry2024theroleof pages 36-40).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
PKN2 functions as a serine/threonine kinase that transfers a phosphate group from ATP to specific serine or threonine hydroxyl groups on protein substrates. The reaction catalyzed by PKN2 can be summarized as follows:  
  ATP + [protein]–OH → ADP + [protein]–O–phosphate + H⁺  
This phosphotransfer reaction underpins the regulation of substrate proteins, altering their conformation and function (scott2020developmentofpkn2a pages 358-360).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The enzymatic activity of PKN2 depends on the presence of divalent metal cations that coordinate the phosphates of ATP. In particular, Mg²⁺ is required as a cofactor for efficient catalytic activity, as is typical of serine/threonine kinases (scott2020developmentofpkn2 pages 336-339).

4. Substrate Specificity  
PKN2 preferentially phosphorylates serine and threonine residues on its substrates. Studies of substrate recognition reveal that PKN2 targets proteins involved in cytoskeletal organization and cell cycle regulation. The recognition of substrates appears to be enhanced by a consensus motif that includes a basic residue – notably an arginine at the –3 position relative to the phosphorylation site – which scores highly in substrate consensus analyses (henry2024theroleof pages 275-279). Confirmed substrates of PKN2 include cytoskeletal regulators such as cortactin, which upon phosphorylation exhibits a reduced association with filamentous actin, vimentin, tau, and regulators of cell cycle progression such as Cdc25 and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), as well as histone deacetylase HDAC5 whose nuclear import is impaired upon phosphorylation (henry2024theroleof pages 36-40, henry2024theroleof pages 40-43).

5. Structure  
The structure of PKN2 is defined by a modular organization that supports its multifaceted functions. Its N-terminal region encompasses three heptapeptide repeat domains (HR1a, HR1b, and HR1c) that mediate binding to Rho family GTPases (e.g., RhoA and Rac1) and serve as platforms for autoinhibitory interactions as well as for activation upon GTPase binding (henry2024theroleof pages 36-40, scott2020developmentofpkn2a pages 29-34). Following this, a C2-like domain is present that is homologous to the calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding motifs found in PKC isoforms. This domain is responsive to lipid activators such as arachidonic acid, linoleic acid, oleic acid, cardiolipin, and phosphatidylinositol bisphosphates (henry2024theroleof pages 36-40, scott2020developmentofpkn2b pages 34-37). The C-terminal portion contains the serine/threonine kinase catalytic domain that adopts the common bilobal structure seen in AGC kinases. The smaller N-terminal lobe typically forms a five-stranded β-sheet while the larger C-terminal lobe is composed primarily of α-helices. The ATP binding cleft lies in the inter-lobe region and is shielded by a glycine-rich activation loop containing the conserved DFG motif required for Mg²⁺ coordination (scott2020developmentofpkn2c pages 29-34, scott2020developmentofpkn2c pages 333-336). Additionally, unique structural features include leucine zipper-like sequences and a proline-rich segment that mediates interactions with Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, which are important for substrate engagement and regulatory complex formation (henry2024theroleof pages 36-40). The only available crystal structure, obtained with ATPγS bound (PDB ID: 4CRS), highlights key interactions within the hinge region—specifically hydrogen bonds involving residues such as Ala684 and Tyr739 (scott2020developmentofpkn2c pages 333-336).

6. Regulation  
The regulatory mechanisms of PKN2 are multifactorial. Full activation of the kinase requires phosphorylation of its catalytic domain. Initial priming is mediated by phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1), which phosphorylates the activation loop, followed by additional phosphorylation events at the turn motif by complexes such as mTORC2 or by cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) that enhance catalytic competence (henry2024theroleof pages 36-40, scott2020developmentofpkn2a pages 336-339). Binding of active (GTP-bound) Rho GTPases—especially RhoA and Rac1—relieves autoinhibition imposed by the HR1 domain, thereby promoting kinase activation in a GTP-dependent manner (henry2024theroleof pages 322-324, henry2024theroleof pages 33-36). In addition, regulatory inputs include lipid cofactors such as unsaturated fatty acids, which interact with the C2-like domain to modulate activity (scott2020developmentofpkn2 pages 29-34, scott2020developmentofpkn2b pages 34-37). Proteolytic processing also plays a role; cleavage by caspase-3 during apoptosis removes inhibitory regions, generating a constitutively active fragment that can alter downstream signaling (henry2024theroleof pages 322-324, henry2024theroleofa pages 322-324). Interactions with adaptor proteins and 14-3-3 complexes further contribute to spatial and temporal control of PKN2 activity by influencing its subcellular localization (scott2020developmentofpkn2a pages 336-339).

7. Function  
PKN2 functions as a key effector in Rho GTPase-mediated signal transduction and plays critical roles in regulating several cellular processes. It is involved in the assembly and maintenance of the actin cytoskeleton; for instance, phosphorylation of cortactin by PKN2 reduces cortactin’s association with filamentous actin, thereby modulating stress fiber formation (henry2024theroleof pages 36-40, henry2024theroleof pages 40-43). In parallel, PKN2 is essential for the regulation of cell cycle progression; it is required for the G2/M phase transition and for abscission during cytokinesis through its phosphorylation of Cdc25 phosphatase, a process that is dependent on the interaction with ECT2 (henry2024theroleof pages 36-40, henry2024theroleof pages 43-46). Furthermore, PKN2 modulates cell adhesion dynamics. In bronchial epithelial cells, it functions as a direct target of RhoA to drive the maturation of primordial junctions into apical junctions, and in keratinocytes it stimulates Fyn kinase activity required for the establishment of skin cell–cell adhesion during differentiation (henry2024theroleof pages 36-40, henry2024theroleofa pages 40-43). Additional roles of PKN2 include the regulation of cell migration, where its kinase activity impacts both the speed and directionality of epithelial bladder cells (henry2024theroleof pages 51-54). Collectively, PKN2 participates in signal transduction pathways that coordinate cytoskeletal rearrangements, adhesion complex dynamics, and cell cycle events, thereby influencing phenomena such as tumor cell invasion and transcriptional regulation via modulation of HDAC5 nuclear import (henry2024theroleof pages 36-40, henry2024theroleof pages 40-43).

8. Other Comments  
Several chemical probes and small molecule inhibitors have been developed to target PKN2. Notably, benzimidazole derivatives have emerged as potent inhibitors with nanomolar efficacy and selectivity over homologous kinases such as PKN1 (scott2020developmentofpkn2b pages 127-132, scott2020developmentofpkn2b pages 336-339). Although a comprehensive catalog of disease-associated mutations in PKN2 is not available in the current literature, dysregulated PKN2 activity has been implicated in various malignancies, including colorectal cancer, as well as in disorders involving aberrant cell migration and adhesion (henry2024theroleof pages 322-324, scott2020developmentofpkn2a pages 336-339). The development of these selective chemical probes is instrumental for enabling further research into PKN2’s cellular functions and for evaluating its potential as a therapeutic target in oncology and other disease states (scott2020developmentofpkn2a pages 358-360).
