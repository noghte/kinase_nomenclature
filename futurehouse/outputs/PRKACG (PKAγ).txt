1. Phylogeny  
PRKACG, the gamma isoform of the catalytic subunit of cAMP‐dependent protein kinase (PKA), is a member of the AGC kinase family that, according to extensive kinome analyses, shares a highly conserved catalytic core with its paralogs PRKACA and PRKACB found throughout vertebrates (hanks1995theeukaryoticprotein pages 2-3). PRKACG is thought to have arisen via retrotransposition, as it lacks introns, and is predominantly expressed in the testis of higher primates, distinguishing its evolutionary path from the ubiquitously expressed canonical isoforms (søberg2013evolutionarypathsof pages 2-2, turnham2016proteinkinasea pages 3-4). Phylogenetic reconstructions based on the conserved kinase domain place it squarely within the AGC group, indicating that it is an evolutionarily more recent addition relative to the other PKA catalytic subunits, which emerged following gene duplication events in early vertebrate evolution (søberg2013evolutionarypathsof pages 1-2, hanks1995theeukaryoticprotein pages 2-3).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
PRKACG catalyzes the phosphoryl transfer reaction in which the terminal (γ) phosphate group of ATP is transferred to serine or threonine residues on target proteins, following the overall reaction: ATP + [protein]-(L‑serine or L‑threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L‑serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (hanks1995theeukaryoticprotein pages 2-3).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The enzymatic activity of PRKACG depends critically on divalent metal ions, with Mg²⁺ serving as the essential cofactor that stabilizes ATP binding and facilitates the proper orientation of substrates during phosphoryl transfer (johnson2001dynamicsofcampdependent pages 17-18, endicott2012thestructuralbasis pages 4-6).

4. Substrate Specificity  
Like other PKA catalytic subunits, PRKACG preferentially phosphorylates protein substrates that contain basic amino acid motifs, typically recognizing the consensus sequence R-R-X-S/T, where the basic residues enhance substrate binding and orient the target serine or threonine for efficient phosphoryl transfer (pidoux2010specificityandspatial pages 2-3, johnson2001dynamicsofcampdependent pages 2-3).

5. Structure  
The three‐dimensional structure of PRKACG consists of a conserved bilobal kinase domain that is characteristic of the AGC kinase group; the N‐terminal lobe is composed primarily of β‐strands while the larger C‐terminal lobe is predominantly α‐helical and forms the substrate–binding groove (johnson2001dynamicsofcampdependent pages 5-7, endicott2012thestructuralbasis pages 4-6). Critical structural features include a glycine-rich loop at the N terminus that anchors ATP, a catalytic loop containing key residues such as Lys72 and Asp184 that are essential for the phosphoryl transfer reaction, and an activation loop that, upon phosphorylation (typically at a residue equivalent to Thr197 in PKA), rearranges to align the catalytic machinery (taylor2013pkalessonslearned pages 16-19, hanks1995theeukaryoticprotein pages 3-4). In addition, the C-terminal tail contributes to intramolecular regulatory interactions that stabilize the enzyme’s active conformation, and the overall three-dimensional organization is similar to that observed in high-resolution crystal structures of other PKA catalytic subunits (johnson2001dynamicsofcampdependent pages 5-7).

6. Regulation  
Regulation of PRKACG occurs through multiple mechanisms; in its basal state, it exists as part of a tetrameric holoenzyme complex in which two regulatory (R) subunits bind tightly to the catalytic subunits, thereby keeping the kinase inactive until an increase in intracellular cAMP levels induces a conformational change and leads to holoenzyme dissociation (johnson2001dynamicsofcampdependent pages 1-2, pidoux2010specificityandspatial pages 2-3). Post‐translational modifications, most notably phosphorylation events within the activation loop and the C-terminal tail (such as the phosphorylation of Thr197 and Ser338 in canonical PKA isoforms), are critical for fully activating the kinase by stabilizing its catalytic conformation (taylor2013pkalessonslearned pages 5-6, johnson2001dynamicsofcampdependent pages 17-18). Furthermore, experimental evidence indicates that the PRKACG isoform displays distinct regulatory behavior, including a reduced sensitivity to inhibition by the endogenous peptide inhibitor PKI and a requirement for higher cAMP concentrations to trigger dissociation from type I regulatory subunit complexes (søberg2013evolutionarypathsof pages 2-2).

7. Function  
PRKACG functions as a serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates a broad spectrum of substrates located in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, thereby modulating diverse cellular processes such as gene expression, signal transduction, metabolism, and cell cycle progression (johnson2001dynamicsofcampdependent pages 2-3, taylor2013pkalessonslearned pages 16-19). Its activation is tightly coupled to fluctuations in intracellular cAMP levels, which, upon binding to the regulatory subunits of the PKA holoenzyme, results in the release of the active catalytic subunit to initiate downstream signaling events (pidoux2010specificityandspatial pages 2-3, newton2003regulationofthe pages 1-2). PRKACG is believed to be predominantly expressed in the testis, suggesting a specialized role in reproductive physiology, although its complete range of physiological functions remains less well characterized compared to the more ubiquitously expressed PRKACA and PRKACB isoforms (søberg2013evolutionarypathsof pages 2-2, turnham2016proteinkinasea pages 3-4).

8. Other Comments  
Several studies have highlighted unique regulatory features of PRKACG relative to other PKA catalytic subunits; notably, its in vitro activity exhibits reduced inhibition by the protein kinase inhibitor (PKI) and necessitates higher concentrations of cAMP for holoenzyme dissociation, which may imply specialized regulatory roles in tissues where it is expressed (søberg2013evolutionarypathsof pages 2-2, taylor2013pkalessonslearned pages 16-19). Although the general inhibitor profile for PKA catalytic activity is well established—with peptide-based inhibitors targeting the conserved ATP-binding site—the specificity and potency of such inhibitors toward the gamma isoform have not been definitively elucidated (taylor2013pkalessonslearned pages 16-19). Regulatory disruptions in PKA signaling, including those affecting PRKACG, have been implicated in various pathological conditions; however, direct disease associations and the impact of specific mutations within the PRKACG gene are not comprehensively characterized in the current literature (johnson2001dynamicsofcampdependent pages 18-19).
