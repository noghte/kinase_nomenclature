1. Phylogeny  
Protein kinase C alpha (PKCα) is a member of the conventional or classical PKC subfamily, which falls under the larger AGC kinase superfamily that is conserved from yeast to humans (griner2007proteinkinasec pages 1-2). Orthologs of PKCα have been identified in all mammalian species, and the protein exhibits a high degree of sequence and domain conservation when compared with its isoforms such as PKCβ and PKCγ (newton2018proteinkinasec pages 1-3, garciaconcejo2021proteinkinasec pages 1-2). Evolutionary analyses have shown that the modular architecture found in PKCα—comprising regulatory regions and a catalytic domain—is an ancient feature maintained since early eukaryotic evolution, and its conservation underscores the fundamental role of its signaling function in biological systems (nakashima2002proteinkinasecα pages 1-1, newton2003regulationofthe pages 1-2).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
PKCα catalyzes the phosphoryl transfer from ATP to specific serine and threonine residues present within protein substrates, following the general reaction: ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (OpenTargets Search: -PRKCA). This phosphorylation reaction directly modifies the functional state of target proteins by adding a phosphate group, thereby altering their conformation, interaction capabilities, or activity (newton2018proteinkinasec pages 3-4, griner2007proteinkinasec pages 1-2).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The catalytic activity of PKCα is strictly dependent on the presence of several cofactors. In particular, calcium ions (Ca²⁺) bind to the C2 domain and are essential for membrane recruitment and activation (farah2012theroleof pages 16-18). Diacylglycerol (DAG) along with specific phospholipids—most notably phosphatidylserine (PS)—bind to its tandem C1 domains to relieve autoinhibition and promote a conformational change that makes the active site accessible (newton2003regulationofthe pages 2-3, griner2007proteinkinasec pages 4-4). In addition, while Mg²⁺ is commonly required by most kinases to coordinate ATP binding, the primary cofactor-mediated regulatory inputs for PKCα are derived from Ca²⁺, DAG, and PS (newton2018proteinkinasec pages 21-22).

4. Substrate Specificity  
PKCα exhibits substrate specificity primarily towards serine/threonine residues, phosphorylating target proteins that are engaged in various signaling pathways (griner2007proteinkinasec pages 3-4). Although a rigid consensus sequence has not been universally defined, PKCα generally recognizes substrate motifs that are enriched in basic amino acids in the vicinity of the phosphorylation site, thus facilitating binding to its catalytic groove (nakashima2002proteinkinasecα pages 5-5). Its substrate repertoire includes proteins such as RAF1, BCL2, CSPG4, and TNNT2, among others, which explains its involvement in a plethora of cellular processes ranging from the MAPK/ERK cascade to apoptotic regulatory pathways (OpenTargets Search: -PRKCA, farah2012theroleof pages 16-18). Moreover, PKCα substrate specificity is further refined by the spatial colocalization of the kinase with its substrate proteins at the membrane or other subcellular compartments (newton2018proteinkinasec pages 9-11).

5. Structure  
PKCα is characterized by a modular structure that comprises an N-terminal regulatory region and a C-terminal catalytic domain. The regulatory segment contains an autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate region that occupies the substrate-binding site in the inactive state (newton2003regulationofthe pages 1-2, nakashima2002proteinkinasecα pages 1-2). Downstream of the pseudosubstrate, PKCα bears two tandem C1 domains—designated C1A and C1B—that bind diacylglycerol and phorbol esters, thereby playing a central role in mediating membrane association (farah2012theroleof pages 16-18). Adjacent to the C1 modules is a C2 domain, which binds calcium ions and anionic phospholipids to further facilitate translocation to cellular membranes (newton2018proteinkinasec pages 21-22). The catalytic domain located at the C-terminus features all the characteristic motifs of AGC kinases, including the activation loop, turn motif, and hydrophobic motif; these elements work in concert to establish the proper conformation of the active site and ensure catalytic competence (steinberg2008structuralbasisof pages 3-5, newton2001proteinkinasec pages 3-4). High-resolution structural studies and predictive models, such as those generated by AlphaFold, reveal that the catalytic domain forms a bilobal structure with an ATP-binding cleft and a regulated substrate-binding groove that is modulated by the positioning of the hydrophobic spine and C-helix (newton2018proteinkinasec pages 32-36, newton2001proteinkinasec pages 9-10).

6. Regulation  
Regulation of PKCα is achieved through a combination of cofactor binding, phosphorylation events, and protein–protein interactions. In its basal state, the pseudosubstrate segment maintains the enzyme in an autoinhibited conformation, which is disrupted upon binding of Ca²⁺ to the C2 domain and DAG to the C1 domains, triggering a conformational shift and translocation to the membrane (farah2012theroleof pages 16-18, newton2003regulationofthe pages 6-7). Subsequent to membrane association, PKCα undergoes a series of phosphorylation events that are crucial for its maturation and stability. Phosphorylation of the activation loop by PDK1 represents a priming event, followed by autophosphorylation at the turn motif and hydrophobic motif, which together lock the enzyme in a catalytically competent and protease-resistant conformation (parekh2000multiplepathwayscontrol pages 1-2, nakashima2002proteinkinasecα pages 4-5). In addition, prolonged exposure to phorbol esters can induce dephosphorylation, ubiquitination, and eventual proteasomal degradation of PKCα, serving as a negative feedback mechanism to attenuate signaling (newton2018proteinkinasec pages 36-38, griner2007proteinkinasec pages 14-14). Allosteric regulation via interactions with scaffold proteins such as RACK further fine-tunes its subcellular localization and substrate accessibility, thereby modulating its overall signaling output (duquesnes2011pkcdeltaandpkcepsilon pages 2-3, newton2001proteinkinasec pages 1-2).

7. Function  
PKCα plays a multifaceted role in the regulation of numerous cellular processes. It is involved in both positive and negative regulation of cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, exerting its effects by phosphorylating key signaling molecules such as RAF1 and by modulating pathways like the MAPK/ERK cascade (OpenTargets Search: -PRKCA, griner2007proteinkinasec pages 1-2). PKCα also participates in the regulation of apoptosis and cell survival, in part through its action on proteins such as BCL2, and contributes to differentiation programs in various cell types (farah2012theroleof pages 16-18, griner2007proteinkinasec pages 4-4). In addition, its activity is linked to cell migration and adhesion processes, which are particularly relevant in the context of tumorigenesis and metastasis (paraboschi2014functionalvariationsmodulating pages 1-2, nakashima2002proteinkinasecα pages 6-7). Beyond its roles in proliferative and apoptotic signaling, PKCα is implicated in cardiac hypertrophy, angiogenesis, and platelet function, and it plays part in mediating inflammatory responses (kamp2000regulationofcardiac pages 1-3, newton2018proteinkinasec pages 17-19). Thus, PKCα functions as a critical nodal point within various signaling networks that dictate outcomes ranging from growth and differentiation to cell cycle arrest and programmed cell death.

8. Other Comments  
PKCα is a clinically significant target as its dysregulation has been associated with several pathological conditions, including various cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders (newton2018proteinkinasec pages 15-17, steinberg2008structuralbasisof pages 18-19). Specific small-molecule inhibitors, such as Midostaurin, have been developed to modulate PKCα activity in therapeutic settings, and ongoing studies continue to assess the potential of targeting PKCα in cancer treatment (griner2007proteinkinasec pages 3-4). Furthermore, mutations or aberrant phosphorylation patterns affecting PKCα have been correlated with altered membrane localization, defective substrate recognition, and changes in kinase stability, thereby influencing its dual role as either a tumor suppressor or a promoter of oncogenic signaling depending on the cellular context (steinberg2008structuralbasisof pages 37-39, nakashima2002proteinkinasecα pages 4-5). Interactions with scaffolding proteins and compartmentalized signaling further contribute to the complexity of PKCα regulation, making it both a challenging and promising target for pharmacological intervention (duquesnes2011pkcdeltaandpkcepsilon pages 1-2, newton2001proteinkinasec pages 2-3).
