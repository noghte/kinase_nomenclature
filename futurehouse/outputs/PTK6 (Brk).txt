1. Phylogeny  
Protein‐tyrosine kinase 6 (PTK6), also known as BRK, belongs to a distinct subgroup of intracellular non‐receptor tyrosine kinases that is evolutionarily related to the Src family kinases yet diverged through gene duplication and domain reorganization. PTK6 shares a related domain architecture with members of the Src family but is classified within the BRK family kinases together with FRK and SRMS, which differ notably by the absence of an N‐terminal myristoylation signal and subsequent membrane‐targeting motifs. Orthologs of PTK6 have been identified in mammals – for instance, the murine ortholog, known as Sik, displays considerable sequence and structural similarity, underscoring a conserved role in epithelial cell biology. The gene is localized to human chromosome 20q13.3, and its exon–intron organization further distinguishes it from classical Src kinases while maintaining the conserved SH3, SH2, and kinase domains that define this family (ai2013brkptk6cooperateswith pages 1-2, brauer2010buildingabetter pages 1-2, sen2011regulationofsrc pages 1-2).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
PTK6 catalyzes the transfer of the γ‐phosphate from ATP to specific tyrosine residues on substrate proteins. In a typical phosphorylation reaction, the enzyme binds ATP and a protein substrate, resulting in the production of ADP and a phosphorylated tyrosine residue on the substrate along with a proton release. This reaction can be summarized as:  
  ATP + protein‐(L‐tyrosine) → ADP + protein‐(L‐tyrosine)‐phosphate + H⁺ (chen2004brkactivatesrac1 pages 1-2).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
As with most protein kinases, the catalytic activity of PTK6 depends on the presence of divalent metal ions. In particular, Mg²⁺ is required to coordinate ATP binding and facilitate the transfer of the phosphate group onto the substrate, thereby enabling enzymatic activity (fry2001phosphoinositide3kinasesignalling pages 4-6).

4. Substrate Specificity  
PTK6 exhibits substrate specificity characteristic of tyrosine kinases. Its substrates include various RNA‐binding proteins (such as SAM68), transcription factors (including STAT3 and STAT5A/B), and signaling molecules (for example, p190RhoGAP and paxillin). Detailed biochemical studies have shown that PTK6 phosphorylates paxillin predominantly at tyrosine residues Y31 and Y118, modifications that promote changes in focal adhesion dynamics relevant to cell migration and invasion (chen2004brkactivatesrac1 pages 1-2, pages 3-5). In addition, analyses of target sequences indicate that the consensus motif recognized by PTK6 often conforms to a pattern of the form X–(E/I/L/N)–Y–(D/E)–(D/E), thereby conferring specificity for substrates that display this signature sequence (brauer2010buildingabetter pages 17-19).

5. Structure  
The full‐length PTK6 protein comprises 451 amino acids and exhibits a modular architecture that includes several distinct domains. Its N‐terminal region lacks the myristoylation motif typically found in Src family kinases, thereby contributing to its soluble and flexible intracellular localization (ai2013brkptk6cooperateswith pages 1-2, brauer2010buildingabetter pages 2-4). Following this region is an SH3 domain that mediates binding to proline‐rich sequences in substrates or adaptor proteins and plays a role in autoregulatory interactions. Adjacent to the SH3 domain is the SH2 domain, which specifically recognizes phosphorylated tyrosine residues on interacting partners, thus contributing to the assembly of multiprotein signaling complexes. The C‐terminal portion of PTK6 contains the kinase (SH1) domain responsible for its catalytic activity; this domain harbors key structural elements such as the ATP‐binding pocket, the activation loop, and the C‐helix, with the latter two being critical for both the catalytic activity and regulatory control of the enzyme. Notably, phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue in the activation loop (Y342) enhances kinase activity, whereas phosphorylation at a C-terminal tyrosine (Y447) promotes an autoinhibited conformation via intramolecular interactions with the SH2 domain (brauer2010buildingabetter pages 2-4, pages 8-10; chen2004brkactivatesrac1 pages 1-2).

6. Regulation  
PTK6 is regulated by several post‐translational mechanisms, prominently through phosphorylation. Autophosphorylation at tyrosine Y342 is associated with an active kinase conformation, while phosphorylation at tyrosine Y447 induces autoinhibition by facilitating intramolecular binding to the SH2 domain, thereby reducing catalytic activity. In addition to these phosphorylation events, PTK6 regulation is influenced by its intracellular localization; it shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus depending on cellular context and differentiation state. External signals, such as those mediated by receptor tyrosine kinases including HER2 and EGFR, modulate PTK6 activation and its interaction with downstream substrates. For example, increased HER2 expression has been linked to elevated PTK6 levels and enhanced phosphorylation of substrates critical for cell survival, migration, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, as demonstrated in breast cancer cell models (ai2013brkptk6cooperateswith pages 1-2, pages 7-8; anderson2013breasttumorkinase pages 1-2; sen2011regulationofsrc pages 8-9).

7. Function  
PTK6 plays multifaceted roles in regulating both normal epithelial homeostasis and oncogenic processes. In normal epithelial tissues, its expression is typically associated with cells undergoing differentiation, where it participates in the modulation of growth, survival, and apoptosis. In contrast, aberrant expression of PTK6 is observed in a significant proportion of breast carcinomas and other epithelial tumors, where it contributes to oncogenic signaling. Functionally, PTK6 phosphorylates a range of substrates that include RNA-binding proteins (such as SAM68), transcription factors (STAT3 and STAT5A/B), and cytoskeletal signaling proteins (such as paxillin and p190RhoGAP); these phosphorylation events influence processes such as mRNA processing, cell migration, survival, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. In breast cancer models, PTK6 has been shown to cooperate with HER2 and Src to promote cell survival and migration, and its knockdown leads to increased apoptosis and reduced invasive capacity. Additionally, by phosphorylating ARAP1 following EGF stimulation, PTK6 enhances EGFR signaling by delaying receptor down‐regulation, thereby sustaining mitogenic and survival signals (ai2013brkptk6cooperateswith pages 1-2, pages 3-5; chen2004brkactivatesrac1 pages 2-2; brauer2010buildingabetter pages 5-7; anderson2013breasttumorkinase pages 1-2).

8. Other Comments  
Owing to its involvement in critical signaling cascades that control cell growth, differentiation, and migration, PTK6 has emerged as a potential therapeutic target in various carcinomas, particularly breast cancer. Experimental studies have demonstrated that inhibition or knockdown of PTK6 increases apoptosis and reduces migratory capacity in cancer cell models, thereby underscoring its functional relevance in tumor progression. In addition to its catalytic function, PTK6 may also act as an adaptor protein, assembling multiprotein complexes through its SH2 and SH3 domains. Although specific chemical inhibitors targeted at PTK6 are under investigation, its context-dependent regulation and diverse substrate repertoire continue to be active areas of research aimed at uncovering novel strategies for therapeutic intervention (ai2013brkptk6cooperateswith pages 7-8, chen2004brkactivatesrac1 pages 3-5, fry2001phosphoinositide3kinasesignalling pages 6-7, lin2016thelinkalncrna pages 24-30).
