1. Phylogeny  
Serine/threonine‐protein kinase RIO2 (RIOK2) is a member of the evolutionarily ancient RIO kinase family, which comprises the atypical kinases RIOK1, RIOK2, and RIOK3 and is conserved from lower eukaryotes such as yeast to higher organisms including humans (ferreiracerca2012atpasedependentroleof pages 1-9, li2022pancanceranalysesreveal pages 18-19). RIOK2 and its paralogs share a common ancestry with kinases that have diverged from the conventional eukaryotic protein kinase (ePK) superfamily, reflecting an early evolutionary branch distinct from the typical AGC, CMGC, and other classical kinase families (knight2007conservationvariabilityand pages 5-7, li2022pancanceranalysesreveal pages 18-19). Orthologs of RIOK2 have been identified in a wide range of species, indicating that its core catalytic apparatus has been maintained across evolution and is essential for fundamental cellular processes such as ribosome maturation (ferreiracerca2012atpasedependentroleof pages 1-9). In addition, phylogenetic analyses suggest that the structural features of RIOK2—particularly its atypical kinase domain and accessory regions—are conserved, although certain regions such as the substrate-binding groove have evolved to accommodate species‐specific substrates (knight2011thestructuraland pages 67-74). The evolutionary conservation of RIOK2 positions it within a core set of kinases that are critical for ribosome biogenesis and cell cycle progression, linking its ancient origins with modern cellular regulation in multicellular organisms (li2022pancanceranalysesreveal pages 18-19). Furthermore, comparative genomic studies have revealed that the domain architecture of RIOK2, which includes an N-terminal winged helix domain and a central atypical kinase domain, is a feature that predates the divergence of major eukaryotic lineages, underscoring its role as an evolutionarily conserved regulator (ferreiracerca2012atpasedependentroleof pages 1-9). The phylogenetic context of RIOK2 therefore reflects not only its ancient roots but also its participation in a network of ribosome assembly factors that are maintained across diverse species (li2022pancanceranalysesreveal pages 18-19).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
RIOK2 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to specific serine or threonine residues on its substrate proteins, following the general reaction mechanism characteristic of protein kinases (ferreiracerca2012atpasedependentroleof pages 1-9). In this reaction, ATP is bound and hydrolyzed, resulting in the production of ADP and a phosphoprotein along with the concomitant release of a proton (ferreiracerca2012atpasedependentroleof pages 1-9). The chemical reaction can be summarized as follows: ATP + [protein]–OH → ADP + [protein]–O–PO₃²⁻ + H⁺, where [protein] represents the target substrate associated with the maturing pre‐40S ribosomal subunit (ferreiracerca2012atpasedependentroleof pages 1-9). Although RIOK2’s substrate set is restricted to proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis under physiological conditions, its catalytic mechanism adheres to the classical kinase reaction scheme (li2022pancanceranalysesreveal pages 2-3).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The catalytic activity of RIOK2 depends on the presence of divalent metal ions, with Mg²⁺ being the principal cofactor required to facilitate ATP binding and hydrolysis (maurice2019invitrodimerization pages 40-41). Mg²⁺ ions coordinate with ATP in the active site of RIOK2, stabilizing the negative charges of the phosphate groups and thereby enabling efficient transfer of the phosphate moiety to the substrate (ferreiracerca2012atpasedependentroleof pages 11-14). In vitro biochemical assays consistently demonstrate that the inclusion of Mg²⁺ in reaction buffers is essential for both the ATPase and kinase activities of RIOK2, underscoring the cofactor’s critical role in the enzymatic reaction (maurice2019invitrodimerization pages 40-41). The requirement for Mg²⁺ is in line with the behavior of most serine/threonine kinases, which generally depend on a divalent cation to optimize catalytic efficiency (ferreiracerca2012atpasedependentroleof pages 1-9).

4. Substrate Specificity  
RIOK2 phosphorylates target substrates that are integral to the maturation of the 40S ribosomal subunit, including key assembly factors such as NOB1, PNO1, and LTV1 (ferreiracerca2012atpasedependentroleof pages 1-9). Although experimental phosphorylation assays have confirmed the ability of RIOK2 to modify these substrates during pre-40S ribosome processing, a definitive consensus phosphorylation motif has not yet been fully established (li2022pancanceranalysesreveal pages 2-3). Sequence analyses of the catalytic domain and the variable substrate-binding region suggest that while the catalytic core is conserved, variations in the residues that form the substrate recognition groove impart unique specificity to RIOK2 (knight2007conservationvariabilityand pages 7-10). Structural studies indicate that the substrate-binding groove exhibits significant sequence variability when compared to classical serine/threonine kinases, which may account for its selective recognition of ribosome assembly factors (knight2011thestructuraland pages 67-74). As a result, RIOK2 appears to target a defined subset of serine/threonine residues that are present on pre-40S ribosomal proteins, although the precise amino acid preferences remain to be fully elucidated (ferreiracerca2012atpasedependentroleof pages 1-9).

5. Structure  
The three-dimensional structure of RIOK2 is characterized by an atypical kinase domain that diverges from the conventional catalytic domains of typical eukaryotic protein kinases while retaining many of the essential features required for ATP binding and phosphotransfer activity (ferreiracerca2012atpasedependentroleof pages 1-9). The domain organization of RIOK2 includes an N-terminal winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) domain, which is implicated in interactions with RNA and possibly other ribosomal components, and a central catalytic kinase domain that houses the critical ATP-binding pocket (ferreiracerca2012atpasedependentroleof pages 1-9, li2022pancanceranalysesreveal pages 2-3). In addition, a eukaryote-specific C-terminal extension is present in RIOK2, which may contribute to protein–protein interactions during ribosome maturation (ferreiracerca2012atpasedependentroleof pages 1-9). High-resolution structural data derived from crystallographic studies of Rio2 homologs, such as those from Chaetomium thermophilum, have provided significant insights into the overall fold and active site configuration of RIOK2, even though direct structural studies on the human enzyme have largely relied on comparative modeling and inhibitor-bound structures available for RIOK2 (knight2011thestructuraland pages 54-59). A unique aspect of the human RIOK2 structure is its ability to form a homodimer in vitro, a phenomenon that alters the conformation of its ATP-binding site by locking it in an apo (ligand-free) state (maurice2019invitrodimerization pages 17-20). The dimeric association is mediated by conserved residues located in the region of the glycine loop, the catalytic loop, and adjacent helices such as the F-helix and C-helix, which collectively contribute to the formation of a stable dimer interface (maurice2019invitrodimerization pages 29-35). This dimerization-induced conformational change is not observed in all species; for instance, homologs from certain fungi tend to exist as monomers, indicating that the regulation of oligomeric state may be an evolved feature in higher eukaryotes (knight2011thestructuraland pages 67-74, li2022pancanceranalysesreveal pages 8-12). Within the kinase domain, key catalytic features such as the glycine-rich loop, responsible for ATP positioning, the catalytic loop, and the activation loop are present, albeit with atypical sequence motifs that distinguish RIOK2 from classical ePKs (knight2007conservationvariabilityand pages 5-7, knight2011thestructuraland pages 59-67). Moreover, the positioning of the eukaryote-specific αI helix in human RIOK2 deviates from that in orthologs such as ctRio2, further emphasizing structural adaptations that may affect its enzymatic function and regulatory interactions (maurice2019invitrodimerization pages 4-7). Collectively, these structural insights not only define the three-dimensional architecture of RIOK2 but also highlight unique features—such as dimerization and domain extensions—that may underlie its specialized role in ribosome biogenesis and cell cycle regulation (ferreiracerca2012atpasedependentroleof pages 1-9, knight2011thestructuraland pages 67-74).

6. Regulation  
The regulatory mechanisms controlling RIOK2 activity involve a combination of post-translational modifications, conformational changes, and modulation by oligomeric status, all of which contribute to its precise role in ribosome biogenesis and mitotic progression (ferreiracerca2012atpasedependentroleof pages 11-14). Autophosphorylation is a key regulatory mechanism for RIOK2, as the enzyme is capable of phosphorylating itself on specific residues within its catalytic domain, thereby potentially modulating its activity and interaction with assembly factors on pre-40S ribosomal subunits (ferreiracerca2012atpasedependentroleof pages 1-9, li2022pancanceranalysesreveal pages 2-3). In addition, a distinctive feature of RIOK2 regulation is its capacity to form homodimers; the dimerization event has been shown to lock the ATP-binding pocket in an apo state, effectively inhibiting ATP binding and, consequently, kinase activity under certain conditions (maurice2019invitrodimerization pages 17-20, maurice2019invitrodimerization pages 29-35). This conformational regulation by dimerization suggests that RIOK2 activity is finely tuned by dynamic structural rearrangements, ensuring that its enzymatic function is activated only when appropriate in the context of ribosome maturation (knight2011thestructuraland pages 67-74). External regulatory influences are also evident; for instance, phosphorylation by cell cycle kinases such as PLK1 has been implicated in modulating RIOK2 function during the metaphase-anaphase transition, linking its activity to cell cycle progression (li2022pancanceranalysesreveal pages 1-2). Mutagenesis studies targeting conserved catalytic residues—for example, substitutions within the ATP-binding pocket—demonstrate that alterations in these key amino acids can disrupt both ATP binding and dimerization, thereby impairing RIOK2’s kinase function (ferreiracerca2012atpasedependentroleof pages 11-14, knight2007conservationvariabilityand pages 7-10). Collectively, these regulatory mechanisms—including autophosphorylation, dimerization-induced allostery, and phosphorylation by upstream kinases—operate in concert to ensure that RIOK2 activity is tightly controlled during both ribosome assembly and cell cycle transitions (maurice2019invitrodimerization pages 40-41).

7. Function  
RIOK2 performs a critical role in the final stages of cytoplasmic maturation of the 40S ribosomal subunit by mediating the release of late-acting assembly factors from pre-40S particles (ferreiracerca2012atpasedependentroleof pages 1-9). Specifically, its kinase activity is required for the removal of proteins such as NOB1, PNO1, and LTV1, as well as for the processing of the 18S-E pre-rRNA into mature 18S rRNA, a key step in the generation of functional ribosomes (ferreiracerca2012atpasedependentroleof pages 1-9). In addition to its central role in ribosome biogenesis, RIOK2 is involved in cell cycle regulation; it modulates the timing of the metaphase‐anaphase transition during mitotic progression, a process that is dependent on phosphorylation events mediated by kinases such as PLK1 (li2022pancanceranalysesreveal pages 1-2). The dual functionality of RIOK2 in both ribosome assembly and cell cycle control underscores its importance as a regulatory nexus in rapidly proliferating cells, where efficient protein synthesis and strict cell cycle timing are paramount (li2022pancanceranalysesreveal pages 1-2, li2022pancanceranalysesreveal pages 16-17). Moreover, expression analyses in various cancers have revealed that RIOK2 is frequently upregulated, with elevated levels correlating with advanced pathological stages and poor patient outcomes, further supporting its role as an oncogenic driver in tumor progression (li2022pancanceranalysesreveal pages 1-2, li2022pancanceranalysesreveal pages 3-5). The specific interactions of RIOK2 with ribosome biogenesis factors also highlight its integration into a larger macromolecular assembly pathway, wherein its precise kinase and ATPase activities coordinate the orderly progression of ribosomal subunit maturation (ferreiracerca2012atpasedependentroleof pages 1-9). Thus, RIOK2 functions not only as a catalytic enzyme that modifies ribosomal proteins and rRNA processing factors but also as a key regulator of cell cycle transitions necessary for proper cellular proliferation (li2022pancanceranalysesreveal pages 1-2).

8. Other Comments  
Engineered mutations that target conserved residues within the ATP‐binding pocket of RIOK2—such as amino acid substitutions like M189G and V121A—have been employed to sensitize the kinase to bulky ATP analogue inhibitors, providing a powerful chemical-genetic approach to dissect its function during ribosome biogenesis (ferreiracerca2012atpasedependentroleof pages 11-14). In parallel, structural studies using crystallography and analytical ultracentrifugation have demonstrated that human RIOK2 is capable of forming homodimers, a regulatory mechanism that locks the ATP-binding site in an inactive apo state and thereby modulates its enzymatic activity (maurice2019invitrodimerization pages 17-20, maurice2019invitrodimerization pages 29-35). Dysregulation of RIOK2 expression and activity has been documented in multiple cancer types, with aberrantly high levels of RIOK2 mRNA and protein correlating with aggressive tumor phenotypes and decreased overall survival, suggesting that RIOK2 may serve as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target in oncology (li2022pancanceranalysesreveal pages 1-2, li2022pancanceranalysesreveal pages 12-16). Although selective small-molecule inhibitors for RIOK2 are under development, ATP-analogue inhibitors have proven effective in cellular models, highlighting the potential for therapeutic intervention by targeting its unique kinase domain and dimerization interface (ferreiracerca2012atpasedependentroleof pages 11-14, baier2020compoundsfromnatural pages 1-3). Post-translational modifications that regulate RIOK2 activity, including its autophosphorylation and phosphorylation by upstream kinases such as PLK1, further contribute to the complex control of its function during both ribosome maturation and mitotic progression (li2022pancanceranalysesreveal pages 2-3, knight2011thestructuraland pages 54-59). Additionally, while a definitive consensus substrate motif for RIOK2 has not been established, the selective recognition of substrates on pre-40S ribosomal particles underscores its specialized role in ribosome assembly as distinct from classical serine/threonine kinases (knight2007conservationvariabilityand pages 7-10, ferreiracerca2012atpasedependentroleof pages 1-9). Overall, the integration of structural, biochemical, and clinical data establishes RIOK2 as an evolutionarily conserved atypical kinase that is essential for both ribosome biogenesis and cell cycle progression, with significant implications for cancer biology and therapeutic development (li2022pancanceranalysesreveal pages 1-2, rangwala2022kinasesondouble pages 1-2).
