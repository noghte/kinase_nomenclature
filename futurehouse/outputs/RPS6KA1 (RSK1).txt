1. Phylogeny  
RSK1 (ribosomal protein S6 kinase alpha‑1; gene RPS6KA1) is phylogenetically classified as a member of the p90 ribosomal S6 kinase family, which is a subfamily of the MAPK‑activated protein kinases within the broader AGC kinase superfamily. Orthologs of RSK1 have been identified in all mammalian species and are conserved in a range of vertebrates, while similar dual‑kinase domain proteins have been observed in invertebrates as well, reflecting conservation from early metazoans. RSK1 is one of four closely related isoforms (RSK1–RSK4) that emerged via gene duplication events from a common ancestral kinase. Comparative analyses indicate that RSK1 shares significant amino acid sequence and structural homology with RSK2, RSK3, and RSK4, although each isoform contains distinct regulatory elements that contribute to their tissue‑specific expression and functional divergence (anjum2008therskfamily pages 2-4, cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 12-13, lara2013thep90rsk pages 1-2). In relation to other AGC kinases—such as protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase B (AKT), and ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K)—RSK1 forms part of an evolutionarily preserved core of signaling enzymes that emerged early in eukaryotic evolution. Phylogenetic studies based on kinase domain conservation have placed RSK1 alongside these kinases, highlighting its fundamental role in transducing extracellular signals via the Ras–ERK pathway (romeo2012regulationandfunction pages 2-4, ikuta2007crystalstructuresof pages 1-2).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
RSK1 functions as a serine/threonine kinase that catalyzes phosphorylation reactions using ATP as the phosphate donor. In its catalytic cycle, RSK1 transfers the terminal phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins, thereby converting ATP to ADP. The overall chemical reaction can be represented as follows: ATP + [protein]–(L‑serine/threonine) → ADP + [protein]–(L‑serine/threonine)‑phosphate + H⁺ (anjum2008therskfamily pages 2-4, cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 17-18).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The kinase activity of RSK1 is dependent on divalent metal ions, with Mg²⁺ serving as the principal cofactor. Mg²⁺ is essential for proper binding and orientation of ATP within the kinase active site, facilitating the phosphoryl transfer that is critical to catalysis. Without Mg²⁺, the conformation of the ATP binding pocket would be suboptimal and enzymatic activity would be greatly diminished (ikuta2007crystalstructuresof pages 1-2, roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 10-11).

4. Substrate Specificity  
RSK1 exhibits substrate specificity characterized by a preference for phosphorylating serine residues within substrate motifs that typically contain basic amino acids. Peptide library and mutagenesis studies indicate that RSK1 recognizes sequences with a consensus motif resembling Arg/Lys‑X₁‑Arg‑X₂‑X₃‑pSer/Thr, where basic residues at upstream positions (commonly at the −3 and −5 relative to the phosphorylated residue) are critical for efficient substrate recognition (nguyen2008targetingrskan pages 1-2, lara2013thep90rsk pages 4-5). In addition to this minimal consensus, RSK1 phosphorylates specific substrates including transcription factors and regulatory proteins that influence cell growth and survival. The diverse range of substrates targeted by RSK1 reflects its ability to integrate extracellular signals into precise changes in protein phosphorylation (romeo2012regulationandfunction pages 9-10, anjum2008therskfamily pages 2-4).

5. Structure  
RSK1 is organized into two distinct kinase domains arranged sequentially along a single polypeptide chain. The N‑terminal kinase domain (NTKD) is structurally homologous to the catalytic domains of cyclic AMP–dependent kinases such as PKA; it is principally responsible for substrate phosphorylation. The C‑terminal kinase domain (CTKD), more closely related to calcium/calmodulin‑dependent kinases (CAMK), plays a regulatory role by facilitating autophosphorylation events essential for full activation of the NTKD. These two domains are connected by a regulatory linker region that contains several key phosphorylation sites and docking motifs for upstream kinases, including an ERK‑docking domain that mediates interaction with ERK1/2 (ikuta2007crystalstructuresof pages 2-3, cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 13-15).  
Crystal structure studies of the NTKD have revealed the canonical bilobal structure with a smaller N‑terminal lobe formed primarily by β‑sheets and a larger C‑terminal lobe dominated by α‑helices; the active site is located at the interface of these lobes and is lined by conserved residues essential for ATP binding and catalysis. Key structural features include the activation loop—which undergoes a conformational change upon phosphorylation—and the α‑C helix, which helps to stabilize the active conformation of the kinase. In addition, the ATP‑binding pocket is defined by residues that contribute to distinct inhibitor binding modes, as evidenced by crystallographic studies with various ATP‑competitive inhibitors (ikuta2007crystalstructuresof pages 7-9, lee2007p90ribosomals6 pages 1-3, romeo2012regulationandfunction pages 8-9). These unique structural attributes have provided a foundation for structure‑based drug design aimed at selectively inhibiting RSK1 activity.

6. Regulation  
RSK1 regulation occurs primarily through a sequential phosphorylation cascade initiated by extracellular signal‑regulated kinases (ERK1/2). Upon mitogenic or stress-induced stimulation, ERK1/2 bind to a docking site located in the C‑terminal region of RSK1 and phosphorylate key residues in the CTKD, notably at Thr573. This phosphorylation event triggers autophosphorylation within the linker region, including phosphorylation at Ser380, which in turn creates a docking site for phosphoinositide‑dependent kinase 1 (PDK1). PDK1 then phosphorylates the NTKD at Ser221, an essential step for achieving full enzymatic activation (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 17-18, anjum2008therskfamily pages 4-4).  
Additional phosphorylation events include modifications at residues such as Ser363 and autophosphorylation events that may contribute to conformational stabilization and attenuation of ERK binding, thereby serving as a negative feedback mechanism. Regulatory phosphatases such as PP2C are also implicated in the deactivation of RSK1 by reversing these phosphorylation events. Furthermore, RSK1 regulation is influenced by changes in subcellular localization; inactive RSK1 is distributed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, whereas upon activation it transiently associates with the plasma membrane before accumulating in the nucleus to phosphorylate its substrates (romeo2012regulationandfunction pages 5-7, ikuta2007crystalstructuresof pages 9-10).

7. Function  
RSK1 plays a central role in relaying signals from the cell surface to the nucleus, thereby regulating diverse cellular processes. As a serine/threonine protein kinase, RSK1 phosphorylates multiple substrates that span functions in transcriptional regulation, protein synthesis, cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. In fibroblasts, RSK1 is required for EGF‑stimulated phosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB1, which leads to the transcriptional activation of several immediate‑early genes; this establishes a critical link between growth factor stimulation and gene expression (anjum2008therskfamily pages 2-4, cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 17-18).  
RSK1 is also involved in regulating translation through phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 and eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (EIF4B), thereby modulating cap‑dependent protein synthesis in response to mitogenic stimuli. In addition, RSK1 phosphorylates pro‑apoptotic proteins such as BAD and DAPK1; phosphorylation of these substrates inhibits their apoptotic function and consequently promotes cell survival (anjum2008therskfamily pages 4-4, romeo2012regulationandfunction pages 11-12).  
Beyond its roles in transcription and translation, RSK1 modulates key components of the mTOR signaling pathway, influencing cell growth and metabolism. It also phosphorylates regulatory proteins that control cell cycle progression, thereby linking extracellular signals to cell division and differentiation. Through these multiple downstream effectors, RSK1 integrates extracellular cues from growth factors and stress signals into coordinated cellular responses, supporting processes such as proliferation and survival (anjum2008therskfamily pages 2-4, cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 17-18, lara2013thep90rsk pages 5-6).

8. Other Comments  
Several small molecule inhibitors have been developed to target RSK1 and its isoforms in experimental settings. Inhibitors such as SL0101, BI‑D1870, and FMK act as ATP‑competitive or irreversible inhibitors that have been used to dissect the biological roles of RSK1 and to assess its potential as a therapeutic target in oncogenic signaling. Selective inhibitors—some of which exhibit higher potency against RSK1 relative to other isoforms—highlight the opportunity for isoform‑specific drug development (sapkota2007bid1870isa pages 1-2, nguyen2008targetingrskan pages 6-6, mayer2021rsk1vs.rsk2 pages 8-10).  
Dysregulation of RSK1 activity has been associated with various types of human cancers. Elevated RSK1 activity contributes to enhanced cell proliferation, survival, migration, and invasion due to its role in phosphorylating transcription factors and regulators of translation. Although mutations directly affecting RSK1 have not been as clearly defined as those in RSK2—which is implicated in Coffin–Lowry syndrome—the aberrant overexpression and hyperactivation of RSK1 in tumors underscore its importance in oncogenic signaling pathways (romeo2012regulationandfunction pages 9-10, anjum2008therskfamily pages 2-4).  
The integration of upstream signals via ERK1/2 and PDK1 with downstream effects on transcriptional and translational regulators makes RSK1 a nodal point in multiple signaling cascades, thereby presenting opportunities not only for therapeutic inhibition in cancer but also for understanding the broader cellular stress responses. Structural studies of RSK1 further inform rational drug design by revealing unique conformational features in the kinase domains that can be exploited for selective inhibition (ikuta2007crystalstructuresof pages 7-9, gogl2019disorderedproteinkinase pages 10-11).
