1. Phylogeny  
SCYL2, also known as CVAK104 or KIAA1360, is a member of the SCY1‐like protein kinase family and is conserved across eukaryotic species. (conner2005cvak104isa pages 1-2) Its orthologs have been identified not only in mammals but also in plant species, where related SCYL2 genes contribute to clathrin‐mediated vesicle trafficking. (jung2017scyl2genesare pages 1-6) Within the kinome, SCYL2 is grouped together with other SCY1‐like proteins such as SCYL1 and SCYL3; these proteins share a common evolutionary origin and display a similar domain architecture that includes an N‐terminal kinase or kinase‐like domain. (conner2005cvak104isa pages 1-2) Although many conventional kinases trace their ancestry to the last eukaryotic common ancestor, SCYL2 is unique among these proteins because its kinase‐like domain often lacks one or more of the conserved catalytic residues seen in active serine/threonine kinases, a feature that has led to its classification as a potential pseudokinase in some studies. (conner2005cvak104isa pages 3-4)

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
The putative reaction catalyzed by SCYL2 involves the ATP‐dependent transfer of a phosphate group to a substrate protein, specifically phosphorylating serine or threonine residues. (conner2005cvak104isa pages 2-3) In in vitro experiments, SCYL2 has been reported to phosphorylate the β2‐subunit of the AP2 adaptor complex, thereby converting ATP and the substrate into ADP and a phosphorylated form of the substrate, with the concomitant release of a proton. (conner2005cvak104isa pages 2-3)

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The kinase reaction attributed to SCYL2 is dependent upon the presence of divalent cations, most notably Mg²⁺, which is essential for coordinating the binding of ATP and facilitating the transfer of the phosphoryl group. (conner2005cvak104isa pages 5-6)

4. Substrate Specificity  
SCYL2 exhibits marked substrate specificity in that its kinase activity has been shown to preferentially target the β2‐adapting subunit of the AP2 complex, a principal component involved in clathrin‐mediated endocytosis. (conner2005cvak104isa pages 5-6) The phosphorylation appears to be restricted primarily to this subunit, as studies have repeatedly noted minimal or no phosphorylation of other adaptor complex components under similar experimental conditions. (conner2005cvak104isa pages 5-6)

5. Structure  
SCYL2 is a 104‐kilodalton protein composed of 929 amino acids. Its domain organization is characterized by an N‐terminal serine/threonine kinase–like domain that bears structural resemblance to the canonical kinase fold yet is reported to lack a key conserved aspartate residue required for efficient phosphotransfer. (conner2005cvak104isa pages 3-4) The central portion of the protein comprises a predicted coiled‐coil region that likely facilitates protein–protein interactions and may contribute to its ability to participate in larger multiprotein trafficking complexes. (conner2005cvak104isa pages 3-4) The C‐terminal region is less structured and contains conserved sequence motifs, including a DLL motif implicated in clathrin binding and an NPF motif that is recognized by EH domain–containing proteins; these motifs are critical for its integration into clathrin‐coated vesicle machineries. (conner2005cvak104isa pages 3-4) Although high‐resolution crystal structures are not available for SCYL2, homology models based on related kinase structures suggest that the overall three‐dimensional organization of the kinase domain is maintained even in the absence of complete catalytic competence. (conner2005cvak104isa pages 3-4)

6. Regulation  
SCYL2 activity is modulated by extrinsic factors that influence its catalytic and binding properties. In vitro kinase assays have shown that the addition of poly‐L-lysine substantially stimulates SCYL2’s kinase activity, although ATP binding itself occurs independently of this polycation. (conner2005cvak104isa pages 5-6) This observation underscores the presence of separate regulatory modules for nucleotide binding and catalytic activation. (conner2005cvak104isa pages 5-6) Moreover, the phosphorylation status of its target, the β2–adaptin subunit, is subject to regulatory cycles in which SCYL2 and serine/threonine phosphatases such as protein phosphatase 2A may act in opposition, thereby fine‐tuning adaptor complex dynamics during vesicle formation. (conner2005cvak104isa pages 7-7, gingras2015scyl2protectsca3 pages 11-12) The presence of autophosphorylation activity, observed under poly‐L-lysine stimulation, further suggests that SCYL2 might undergo self‐modification that could modulate its activity or protein interactions within the clathrin coat. (conner2005cvak104isa pages 7-7)

7. Function  
SCYL2 functions as a component of the AP2‐containing clathrin coat and is implicated in regulating clathrin‐dependent vesicular trafficking at multiple intracellular locations, including the plasma membrane, the trans‐Golgi network (TGN), and endosomal compartments. (conner2005cvak104isa pages 2-3) In vitro evidence demonstrates that SCYL2 facilitates the phosphorylation of the β2–subunit of the AP2 adaptor complex, a modification that is thought to influence the assembly and dynamics of clathrin‐coated vesicles during receptor endocytosis. (conner2005cvak104isa pages 5-6) Beyond its role in adaptor regulation, SCYL2 has been linked to neuronal function; by modulating the phosphorylation state of AP2 components, it may indirectly regulate the surface expression of excitatory receptors at synapses. Consequently, SCYL2 is posited to play an essential role in neuronal signaling and the proper development of brain circuitry, with particular emphasis on maintaining synaptic homeostasis. (gingras2015scyl2protectsca3 pages 11-12) Proteomic analyses of clathrin‐coated vesicle fractions have identified SCYL2 as a constituent protein, further supporting its role in membrane trafficking between endosomes and the TGN. (mcpherson2010proteomicanalysisof pages 8-9)

8. Other Comments  
To date, no specific chemical inhibitors of SCYL2 have been reported in the peer‐reviewed literature, and its ambiguous kinase activity has led to debate over whether it functions as an active enzyme or more as a regulatory scaffold within vesicular trafficking machinery. (conner2005cvak104isa pages 7-7) In addition, mutations in SCYL2 have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by global developmental delay, arthrogryposis, and microcephaly, thereby highlighting its clinical relevance in human brain development and function; however, the precise catalytic mechanism remains unconfirmed. (gingras2015scyl2protectsca3 pages 11-12) The dual roles of SCYL2—both as a potential serine/threonine kinase and as a mediator of adaptor protein interactions—underscore the need for further biochemical and structural studies to fully elucidate its mechanism of action within the clathrin‐dependent trafficking system.
