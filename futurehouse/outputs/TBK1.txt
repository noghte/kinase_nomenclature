1. Phylogeny  
Serine/threonine‐protein kinase TBK1 is an evolutionarily conserved kinase that is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian species and is a member of the non‐canonical IκB kinase (IKK) family, which also includes IKKε; its orthologs have been identified across vertebrates, indicating that its appearance dates back to early vertebrate evolution (revach2020targetingtankbindingkinase pages 3-4). TBK1 stands apart from the canonical IKKs (IKKα and IKKβ) by its distinct domain organization and regulatory mechanisms, and it is classified within the IKK‐related kinases that share common ancestry with other kinases involved in innate immune responses (shin2019essentialrolesfor pages 1-3). In comparative analyses, TBK1 and IKKε exhibit approximately 49% sequence identity and 64–65% similarity, supporting their grouping within a specific subfamily of kinases that evolved to mediate specialized immunological functions (revach2020targetingtankbindingkinase pages 14-15, yu2012thepivotalrole pages 1-2). Phylogenetic studies have demonstrated that the core components of innate immune signaling—of which TBK1 is a critical member—are highly conserved and have emerged from a common ancestral kinase, aligning TBK1 with a set of proteins that include receptors, adaptors, and other kinases essential for host defense (shin2019essentialrolesfor pages 1-3). Moreover, the evolutionary conservation observed in TBK1’s primary sequence and functional domains indicates its indispensable role in cellular signaling, with orthologs present not only in mammals but also in other vertebrate lineages, which underscores its status within the core kinase set required for innate immune surveillance (revach2020targetingtankbindingkinase pages 3-4).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
TBK1 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to specific serine or threonine residues on its substrate proteins, thereby modulating their activity; the canonical biochemical reaction follows the general formula: ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (bodur2018theikk‐relatedkinase pages 19-20). This phosphorylation event constitutes the primary reaction mediated by TBK1 and is critical for initiating downstream signaling cascades involved in antiviral and inflammatory responses (bodur2018theikk‐relatedkinase pages 19-20). The reaction is typical of serine/threonine kinases, serving as a switch to turn on or modulate the functions of key regulatory proteins in the cell (bodur2018theikk‐relatedkinase pages 19-20).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The catalytic activity of TBK1 requires ATP as the phosphate donor and is dependent on the presence of divalent cations, particularly magnesium ions (Mg²⁺), which facilitate the proper orientation of ATP in the active site and stabilize the transition state during phosphate transfer (ivanov2024insilicoinsights pages 1-2). This cofactor requirement is consistent with the general mechanism of serine/threonine kinases, where Mg²⁺ acts as a critical cofactor for effective catalysis and substrate phosphorylation (ivanov2024insilicoinsights pages 1-2).

4. Substrate Specificity  
TBK1 exhibits substrate specificity for serine/threonine residues within defined sequence motifs present in its target proteins; its substrates include key adaptor proteins and transcription factors that are central to innate immune signaling. Among the well‐characterized substrates of TBK1 are interferon regulatory factors IRF3 and IRF7, which contain serine residues that, once phosphorylated, promote their homodimerization and nuclear translocation to drive type I interferon gene expression (cooper2017tbk1providescontextselective pages 22-26). Moreover, TBK1 phosphorylates additional substrates such as DDX3X and STING, thereby connecting pattern recognition receptor signaling with the downstream activation of antiviral responses (bodur2018theikk‐relatedkinase pages 19-20, cooper2017tbk1providescontextselective pages 22-26). In the context of oncogenic signaling, TBK1 also modulates the phosphorylation state of kinases within the AKT/mTOR pathway, influencing cellular processes such as survival and proliferation (cooper2017tbk1providescontextselective pages 22-26). Although a consensus substrate motif in the form of a defined amino acid pattern (for example, an RXRXXp[S/T] motif) has been observed for some serine/threonine kinases, the precise consensus sequence for TBK1 substrates is less clearly delineated and appears to be influenced by the recruitment of substrates via adaptor proteins, which contributes to its context‐selective activity (cooper2017tbk1providescontextselective pages 22-26).

5. Structure  
TBK1 is a 729‐amino acid protein that exhibits a modular architecture consisting of several distinct domains critical for its catalytic and regulatory functions. At the N-terminus, TBK1 contains a kinase domain (approximately residues 1–307) that adopts the canonical bi-lobal structure typical of protein kinases and includes key catalytic elements such as the ATP-binding pocket, activation loop, and a conserved catalytic lysine residue essential for phosphotransfer activity (shu2013structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2, ivanov2024insilicoinsights pages 2-3). Within the activation loop of the kinase domain lies the critical serine residue, Ser172, whose phosphorylation is necessary for kinase activation (hu2024mechanismoftbk1 pages 1-2, shu2013structuralinsightsinto pages 10-11). Adjacent to the kinase domain is a ubiquitin-like domain (ULD) that participates in the regulation of TBK1 activity, possibly by mediating protein-protein interactions or influencing substrate presentation (ivanov2024insilicoinsights pages 2-3). Following the ULD, the protein contains two coiled-coil domains—commonly referred to as the scaffold dimerization domain (SDD) and additional coiled-coil regions—that mediate TBK1 dimerization, a process essential for its full catalytic activity and proper subcellular localization (ivanov2024insilicoinsights pages 3-4, revach2020targetingtankbindingkinase pages 3-4). The C-terminal region of TBK1 is responsible for binding adaptor proteins such as TANK, NAP1, and SINTBAD, which determine substrate specificity and target TBK1 to distinct signaling complexes (revach2020targetingtankbindingkinase pages 27-29, miranda2024emergingrolesof pages 3-4). Key structural features within the kinase domain include a well-organized activation loop, a hydrophobic spine that stabilizes the active conformation, and a C-helix that plays a role in orienting ATP within the catalytic pocket; these elements are necessary for proper catalytic function and are conserved across many serine/threonine kinases (shu2013structuralinsightsinto pages 10-11, ivanov2024insilicoinsights pages 2-3). The overall three-dimensional organization, as elucidated by crystallographic studies, reveals that TBK1 functions as a homodimer, with each subunit contributing to the stability and regulatory interactions of the dimeric complex (shu2013structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2, revach2020targetingtankbindingkinase pages 3-4).

6. Regulation  
The activity of TBK1 is stringently controlled by a variety of post-translational modifications and protein-protein interactions that dictate its catalytic activity and downstream signaling. A key regulatory event is the phosphorylation of Ser172 within the activation loop of the kinase domain, which is essential for full activation of TBK1; this phosphorylation event is mediated either through trans-autophosphorylation following dimerization or by upstream kinases (hu2024mechanismoftbk1 pages 1-2, shu2013structuralinsightsinto pages 10-11). TBK1 is also subject to additional phosphorylation events that modulate its stability and activity; for example, phosphorylation at Ser527 by the dual-specificity kinase DYRK2 has been shown to promote TBK1 ubiquitination and degradation, thereby attenuating interferon responses (an2015dyrk2negativelyregulates pages 9-12). In addition to phosphorylation, TBK1 undergoes ubiquitination events that further regulate its activity: K63-linked polyubiquitination of TBK1 can enhance its activation and promote assembly into signaling complexes, while K48-linked ubiquitination targets it for proteasomal degradation (revach2020targetingtankbindingkinase pages 27-29). The recruitment of TBK1 to specific signaling complexes is mediated by interaction with adaptor proteins such as TANK, NAP1, and SINTBAD, which bind in a mutually exclusive fashion to its C-terminal domain and serve to confer substrate specificity by localizing TBK1 to distinct subcellular compartments (miranda2024emergingrolesof pages 1-3, revach2020targetingtankbindingkinase pages 23-27). Cellular localization also impacts TBK1 activation; for instance, its translocation to perinuclear regions or the Golgi apparatus following viral infection is crucial for efficient engagement with substrates such as STING and IRF3 (hu2024mechanismoftbk1 pages 3-4, bodur2018theikk‐relatedkinase pages 19-20). Collectively, these regulatory mechanisms ensure that TBK1 activity is tightly controlled in order to balance antiviral immunity with the prevention of excessive inflammation (revach2020targetingtankbindingkinase pages 14-15, an2015dyrk2negativelyregulates pages 9-12).

7. Function  
TBK1 plays an essential role in mediating innate immune responses by linking pathogen recognition to the transcriptional activation of antiviral and proinflammatory genes. Upon detection of pathogenic components via toll-like receptors, RIG-I-like receptors, or cytosolic DNA sensors, TBK1 is recruited to signaling complexes where it phosphorylates interferon regulatory factors IRF3 and IRF7; this phosphorylation event induces their homodimerization and nuclear translocation, ultimately leading to the transcription of type I interferon genes such as IFNA and IFNB (bodur2018theikk‐relatedkinase pages 19-20, cooper2017tbk1providescontextselective pages 22-26). In addition to its canonical role in antiviral defense, TBK1 is implicated in the regulation of inflammatory responses through the modulation of NF-κB signaling, achieved by phosphorylating components of the NF-κB pathway and contributing to the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (yu2012thepivotalrole pages 1-2, shin2019essentialrolesfor pages 1-3). TBK1 also exerts functions in autophagy by phosphorylating proteins such as p62 and optineurin, thereby promoting the clearance of intracellular pathogens and damaged cellular components; this autophagic activity provides an additional layer of host defense and helps maintain cellular homeostasis (revach2020targetingtankbindingkinase pages 18-19, shu2013structuralinsightsinto pages 8-9). Moreover, in the context of oncogenic signaling, TBK1 has been shown to support cell survival and proliferation through its involvement in the AKT/mTOR pathway, particularly in cancers driven by oncogenic RAS mutations where TBK1 activity is critical for tumor cell viability (cooper2017tbk1providescontextselective pages 22-26, miranda2024emergingrolesof pages 1-3). TBK1’s interactions with adaptor proteins and its regulated activation by post-translational modifications enable it to integrate signals from diverse pathways, thereby coordinating immune responses, cell survival, and metabolic regulation without redundancy in its roles (bodur2018theikk‐relatedkinase pages 19-20, revach2020targetingtankbindingkinase pages 14-15).

8. Other Comments  
Several small-molecule inhibitors have been developed to target TBK1 for therapeutic applications in inflammatory diseases, viral infections, metabolic disorders, and cancer. Notable inhibitors include BX795, MRT67307, and the more selective GSK8612, all of which act by interfering with TBK1’s kinase activity and have been used in preclinical studies to modulate innate immune signaling (revach2020targetingtankbindingkinase pages 27-29, cruz2018assessmentoftankbinding pages 6-7). Additionally, compounds such as amlexanox have been examined for their ability to inhibit TBK1/IKKε activity in the context of metabolic dysfunction and cancer (cruz2018assessmentoftankbinding pages 7-8, zhao2019tankbindingkinase1 pages 14-18). Dysregulation of TBK1 has been linked to multiple disease states, including neurodegenerative disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia, wherein mutations in TBK1 result in reduced kinase activity or altered regulatory interactions (ye2019effectsofalsassociated pages 1-2, ye2019effectsofalsassociated pages 9-10). In cancer biology, TBK1 is critical for oncogenic RAS-driven tumor survival and is associated with resistance to apoptosis and enhanced autophagic processes that support tumor metabolism and progression (cooper2017tbk1providescontextselective pages 22-26, miranda2024emergingrolesof pages 3-4). TBK1 therefore represents a promising therapeutic target, and ongoing research continues to explore selective inhibitors and combination strategies that might modulate its activity in various pathological conditions without compromising its essential role in antiviral immunity (revach2020targetingtankbindingkinase pages 27-29, cruz2018assessmentoftankbinding pages 7-8). Moreover, its central position as an integrator of multiple signaling pathways highlights the potential impact of TBK1-targeted therapies on a wide range of immune and inflammatory processes (bodur2018theikk‐relatedkinase pages 19-20, yu2012thepivotalrole pages 2-3).
