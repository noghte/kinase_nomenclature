1. Phylogeny – TTBK2 is an evolutionarily conserved member of the tau‐tubulin kinase family, which is classified within the casein kinase 1 (CK1) superfamily. Its kinase domain is highly homologous to that of TTBK1, exhibiting approximately 88% identity and 96% similarity across the catalytic regions. Orthologs of TTBK2 have been identified in a wide range of vertebrates, and its conservation across species—from zebrafish to mammals—underscores its fundamental biological role. TTBK2 and TTBK1 likely arose from a gene duplication event early in the evolution of metazoans, and they share common features with other core kinases that emerged in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor. Within the kinome, TTBK2 is grouped alongside kinases that regulate microtubule dynamics and ciliogenesis, distinguishing it functionally from broadly expressed kinases. This evolutionary context places TTBK2 among an ancient set of serine/threonine kinases whose roles are integral to cellular structure and signaling (ikezu2014tautubulinkinase pages 1-2, liachko2014thetautubulin pages 3-5).

2. Reaction Catalyzed – TTBK2 catalyzes the phosphorylation of protein substrates by transferring a phosphate group from ATP to specific serine and threonine residues within these substrates. The reaction it catalyzes can be generally summarized as follows:  
  ATP + [protein] – (L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein] – (L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺.  
In vitro, TTBK2 has been shown to phosphorylate tau protein on serine residues and is also capable of modifying tubulin and other substrates such as MPHOSPH9. The phosphorylation reaction is fundamentally similar to other protein kinases, where the binding and proper positioning of ATP facilitates the nucleophilic attack by the hydroxyl group of the target amino acid, resulting in the formation of a phosphorylated protein product and ADP (ikezu2014tautubulinkinase pages 1-2, potjewyd2023modulationoftau pages 1-2).

3. Cofactor Requirements – As with most serine/threonine kinases, TTBK2 requires divalent metal ions to support its catalytic activity. Although the published literature does not present unique cofactor requirements specific to TTBK2, the phosphorylation reaction is known to depend on the presence of Mg²⁺ ions, which facilitate the binding of ATP within the active site and stabilize the transition state during phosphotransfer. This requirement is consistent with the standard cofactor profile observed in the broader CK1 family and other protein kinases (ikezu2014tautubulinkinase pages 1-2).

4. Substrate Specificity – TTBK2 demonstrates substrate specificity that is characteristic of its class of kinases. In vitro experiments have shown that TTBK2 phosphorylates tau protein at specific serine residues, including Ser208 and Ser210, and it appears to preferentially target substrates that are “primed” by a phosphorylated tyrosine at the +2 position relative to the target serine or threonine. In other words, substrates conforming to a motif such as S/T–X–Yp are favored by TTBK2 for phosphorylation. This type of substrate priming enhances the binding affinity of TTBK2 for its substrate and increases the catalytic efficiency. In addition to tau, TTBK2 also phosphorylates proteins involved in ciliogenesis; for example, it modifies MPHOSPH9, a phosphorylation event that subsequently leads to its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, thereby facilitating the removal of negative regulators of ciliogenesis (ikezu2014tautubulinkinase pages 2-3, bao2021mechanismsofregulation pages 2-4).

5. Structure – TTBK2 is organized with an N-terminal catalytic kinase domain, which in humans spans approximately the first 331 amino acids, and a C-terminal region that is divergent from TTBK1 and other kinases within the CK1 superfamily. The kinase domain adopts a conserved bilobal structure typical of serine/threonine kinases, consisting of a smaller N-terminal lobe primarily involved in ATP binding and a larger C-terminal lobe that contains the substrate-binding site. Key catalytic residues, such as lysine 50 and aspartic acid 141, are invariant and critical for phosphotransferase activity. High-resolution crystal structures of the TTBK2 kinase domain have been determined in complexes with ADP and small-molecule inhibitors, revealing details of the active site geometry, including the arrangement of the activation loop, the hydrophobic spine, and the positioning of the C-helix required for activity (ahamad2023identificationofnovel pages 1-2, marcotte2020thecrystalstructure pages 1-2). In addition, the C-terminal non-catalytic region, although less well-defined structurally, is implicated in mediating protein–protein interactions necessary for subcellular targeting, such as the recruitment of TTBK2 to the basal body during ciliogenesis. Experimental purification and crystallization studies have demonstrated that the catalytic domain functions as a monomer in solution, and the overall structural organization underscores both the conserved enzymatic function and the specialized regulatory roles that differentiate TTBK2 from its close homolog TTBK1 (kitanotakahashi2007expressionpurificationand pages 3-3, ikezu2014tautubulinkinase pages 1-2).

6. Regulation – TTBK2 is subject to multiple layers of regulation that ensure its activity is precisely controlled within the cell. Autophosphorylation events on residues outside the catalytic domain have been reported, and these modifications are thought to modulate both the catalytic activity and the subcellular localization of the enzyme. Recruitment to the basal body is a critical regulatory mechanism; TTBK2 is targeted to the distal end of the mother centriole through its interaction with centriolar proteins such as CEP164, a process that is indispensable for initiating ciliogenesis by promoting CP110 removal. In addition, the phosphorylation state of substrates such as MPHOSPH9 influences their subsequent ubiquitination and degradation, underscoring TTBK2’s role in the regulation of protein stability within ciliogenesis pathways. Disease-associated mutations in TTBK2, for example those that lead to premature truncation of the protein, can disrupt these regulatory processes, leading to mislocalization, decreased kinase activity, and ultimately neurodegenerative phenotypes—as observed in spinocerebellar ataxia type 11 (bao2021mechanismsofregulation pages 14-15, potjewyd2023modulationoftau pages 15-16, ikezu2014tautubulinkinase pages 3-5).

7. Function – TTBK2 is primarily recognized as a serine/threonine kinase that plays a pivotal role in the initiation of ciliogenesis. By binding to the distal end of the basal body, TTBK2 orchestrates the removal of CP110—a protein that caps the mother centriole—and thereby licenses the recruitment of intraflagellar transport (IFT) proteins necessary for the formation of the ciliary axoneme. In this capacity, TTBK2 is essential for the proper formation and maintenance of primary cilia, which are critical for cellular signaling and homeostasis in diverse tissues. Aside from its central role in ciliogenesis, TTBK2 is capable of phosphorylating tau protein in vitro on serine residues; however, its contribution to tau pathology is considered secondary to its role in ciliary assembly. TTBK2 also phosphorylates MPHOSPH9, a modification that leads to the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of MPHOSPH9. The removal of MPHOSPH9 is functionally linked to the clearance of the CP110-CEP97 complex, further promoting cilium formation. Moreover, TTBK2 is required for the recruitment of other proteins, such as CPLANE2 and INTU, to the mother centriole, highlighting its involvement in the dynamic regulation of the ciliary compartment. Expression studies indicate that TTBK2 is ubiquitously expressed, with significant levels noted in the brain, where primary cilia play vital roles in neuronal signaling pathways, and aberrations in TTBK2 function have been associated with neurodegenerative conditions such as spinocerebellar ataxia type 11 (information, potjewyd2023modulationoftau pages 15-16, bao2021mechanismsofregulation pages 15-16, ikezu2014tautubulinkinase pages 1-2).

8. Other Comments – Recent computational and chemical biology studies have identified putative small-molecule inhibitors capable of targeting TTBK2, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. However, due to the high degree of similarity between the kinase domains of TTBK2 and TTBK1, developing inhibitors that are selectively specific for TTBK2 remains challenging. In addition, genetically, TTBK2 is linked to spinocerebellar ataxia type 11; mutations leading to premature protein termination result in loss of kinase activity and mislocalization, events that ultimately contribute to neurodegenerative phenotypes. Although TTBK2 can phosphorylate tau in vitro, its predominant physiological function is to regulate ciliogenesis, and dysregulation of this process has been implicated in a number of ciliopathies as well as in neurodegenerative disease contexts. Furthermore, substrate phosphorylation by TTBK2, such as that of MPHOSPH9, underscores the enzyme’s role in modulating the levels of proteins that negatively regulate cilia formation. The dual functionality of TTBK2 in phosphorylating both cytoskeletal regulators and microtubule-associated proteins situates it as a key node in cellular homeostasis and highlights the importance of continued research into selective inhibitors and the detailed mechanisms underlying its action (ahamad2023identificationofnovel pages 1-2, ikezu2014tautubulinkinase pages 3-5, potjewyd2023modulationoftau pages 1-2).
