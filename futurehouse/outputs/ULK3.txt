1. Phylogeny  
ULK3 is a member of the Unc-51-like kinase family of serine/threonine protein kinases, a group that has been traced back to the ancestral yeast Atg1 kinase. Comparative sequence analyses have established that the ULK family—including ULK1, ULK2, ULK3, ULK4, and the closely related STK36 (also known as fused)—shares a conserved N-terminal catalytic domain while diverging markedly in their regulatory regions. Detailed phylogenetic reconstructions based on core kinase domains show that ULK3 clusters with those kinases involved in autophagy and developmental signaling, particularly the Sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway (maloverjan2010identificationofa pages 1-2, maloverjan2010vertebratehomologuesof pages 100-101). Early gene duplication events in metazoans are responsible for the expansion of this kinase family, yielding paralogs with distinct non-catalytic extensions; for example, ULK1 and ULK2 retain extensive regions outside their kinase domains that are critical for binding to regulatory proteins, whereas ULK3 contains tandem microtubule interacting and trafficking (MIT) domains that confer additional protein–protein interaction capabilities (kasak2018characterizationofprotein pages 7-12, maloverjan2010identificationofa pages 4-6).  
Moreover, sequence identity measurements indicate that ULK3 shares moderate sequence conservation with Drosophila Fu kinase and vertebrate STK36, positioning it on an evolutionary branch that is distinct from but related to the classical autophagy regulators ULK1 and ULK2 (maloverjan2010identificationofa pages 3-4, maloverjan2010vertebratehomologuesof pages 100-101). Phylogenetic studies that incorporate data from crystallography-based multiple sequence alignments further support ULK3’s classification within the broader eukaryotic protein kinase (EPK) superfamily; here, the conservation of key catalytic motifs alongside divergence in regulatory segments suggests that ULK3 evolved as an ancestral element of autophagy and developmental signaling networks (alers2012theincredibleulks pages 1-2, jung2010mtorregulationof pages 5-6).  
Orthologs of ULK3 are detectable across mammalian species, indicating its conservation and functional importance in higher eukaryotes. This evolutionary conservation extends to the overall domain architecture where the catalytic domain remains highly similar while the flanking regions display significant divergence that likely underpins the functional specificity of ULK3 in processes such as cytokinetic abscission, autophagy induction, and SHH pathway regulation (maloverjan2010identificationofa pages 6-9, kasak2018characterizationofprotein pages 1-7). In summary, phylogenetic evidence places ULK3 firmly within the Unc-51-like kinase family as a non‐redundant member with unique structural features that have evolved to mediate specialized signaling functions in vertebrates (maloverjan2010vertebratehomologuesof pages 39-44, alers2012theincredibleulks pages 1-2).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
ULK3 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl groups of serine and threonine residues on substrate proteins. The fundamental chemical reaction it drives can be described by the equation:  
  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺  
This phosphorylation reaction is the hallmark of serine/threonine kinases and modulates the function, localization, and interaction properties of target proteins (caballe2015ulk3regulatescytokinetic pages 2-3). Experimental evidence shows that ULK3 phosphorylates key substrates such as the GLI transcription factors and components of the ESCRT-III complex. In the case of SHH signaling, the kinase activity of ULK3 is directly linked to the phosphorylation of GLI2, an event that is necessary for its nuclear translocation and subsequent activation of SHH target genes (maloverjan2010identificationofa pages 6-9). In addition, ULK3 has been observed to phosphorylate GLI1 and GLI3, albeit with lower in vitro efficiency. The reaction mechanism is dependent on the proper positioning of ATP within an evolutionarily conserved nucleotide-binding pocket in the kinase domain, ensuring specificity and fidelity in phosphoryl transfer (caballe2015ulk3regulatescytokinetic pages 2-3).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
ULK3, like many other serine/threonine kinases, requires divalent metal ions as cofactors for its catalytic activity. Specifically, the presence of Mg²⁺ is essential for binding and proper positioning of ATP within the active site of the kinase domain (kasak2018characterizationofprotein pages 18-22). The Mg²⁺ ion coordinates with the phosphate groups of ATP and facilitates the nucleophilic attack by the hydroxyl group of the substrate’s serine or threonine residue during the phosphoryl transfer reaction. This dependency on Mg²⁺ is consistent with the biochemistry of other kinases operating within the eukaryotic protein kinase family and is critical for the proper enzymatic function of ULK3 (kasak2018characterizationofprotein pages 23-26).

4. Substrate Specificity  
ULK3 displays a degree of substrate specificity that is central to its biological functions. It preferentially phosphorylates proteins implicated in the SHH signaling pathway and autophagy regulation. In vitro assays have demonstrated that ULK3 robustly phosphorylates GLI2, the transcription factor predominantly responsible for mediating SHH downstream signaling, while phosphorylating GLI1 and GLI3 with comparatively lower efficiency (maloverjan2010identificationofa pages 1-2, maloverjan2010identificationofa pages 6-9). Moreover, ULK3 is capable of phosphorylating components of the ESCRT-III complex, a group of proteins essential for the final step of cytokinetic abscission during cell division (caballe2015ulk3regulatescytokinetic pages 2-3). Although a clear consensus sequence or substrate motif for ULK3 has not been conclusively defined in the literature, the kinase appears to target serine/threonine residues that are positioned within regions of its substrates that are critical for subsequent signal transduction. The substrate specificity of ULK3 is thus directly linked to its role in modulating key signaling pathways, ensuring that phosphorylation is precisely coordinated within the cellular context to affect processes such as transcriptional regulation and autophagosome formation (montagnani2019roleofprotein pages 7-8).

5. Structure  
The domain organization of ULK3 is emblematic of its multifunctional role in cellular signaling. Its primary structure is characterized by an N-terminal serine/threonine kinase domain, which encompasses approximately the first 270 amino acids and is responsible for the enzymatic activity. This kinase domain exhibits the canonical bilobal structure observed in eukaryotic protein kinases; it contains an N-terminal lobe that is predominantly β-sheet rich and a larger C-terminal lobe that is primarily composed of α-helices. Key catalytic features within this domain include the activation loop, which undergoes autophosphorylation, the catalytic loop, and the nucleotide-binding cleft that harbors the conserved DFG (Asp-Phe-Gly) and HRD (His-Arg-Asp) motifs (kasak2018characterizationofprotein pages 1-7, kasak2018characterizationofprotein pages 23-26).  
A notable structural attribute of ULK3 is that it is classified as a non-RD kinase. This means that ULK3 lacks the conserved arginine residue immediately preceding the catalytic aspartate in the activation loop, a feature commonly associated with phosphorylation-dependent activation in many other kinases. This non-canonical arrangement suggests that ULK3’s activation may depend more heavily on protein–protein interactions or alternative regulatory mechanisms rather than the traditional activation-loop phosphorylation (kasak2018characterizationofprotein pages 23-26).  
In addition to the kinase domain, ULK3 possesses two tandem microtubule interacting and trafficking (MIT) domains located in its C-terminal region, roughly spanning residues 277–353 and 374–449. These MIT domains are implicated in mediating interactions with components involved in membrane-associated processes, such as the ESCRT-III complex, thereby linking the catalytic function of ULK3 to cytoskeletal and vesicular trafficking events (caballe2015ulk3regulatescytokinetic pages 2-3, kasak2018characterizationofprotein pages 7-12). Structural analyses, including homology modeling and docking studies, have further revealed that the ATP-binding pocket within the kinase domain is amenable to inhibitor binding. Small molecule inhibitors such as SU6668 have been shown to engage this pocket, exhibiting a mixed type of inhibition that is partially competitive with ATP. These insights underscore the potential for structure-based drug design targeting ULK3 (karmacharya2023smallmoleculeinhibitors pages 12-14).  
Collectively, the modular architecture of ULK3—comprising the conserved kinase domain and specialized MIT domains—offers an explanation for its ability to participate in diverse cellular processes by coupling catalytic activity with targeted protein–protein interactions (kasak2018characterizationofprotein pages 7-12, maloverjan2010identificationofa pages 4-6).

6. Regulation  
ULK3 is subject to intricate regulatory mechanisms that govern its kinase activity and downstream signaling functions. In the absence of the Sonic hedgehog (SHH) ligand, ULK3 predominantly exists in an inhibited state through its interaction with the suppressor of fused (SUFU). This interaction results in the inactivation of ULK3’s catalytic activity, thereby preventing the phosphorylation of GLI transcription factors and effectively downregulating SHH signaling (montagnani2019roleofprotein pages 7-8).  
Upon binding of the SHH ligand, a marked change in ULK3’s regulation is observed. SHH stimulation promotes the dissociation of ULK3 from SUFU, enabling ULK3 to undergo autophosphorylation and activation. Once activated, ULK3 phosphorylates GLI2, facilitating its nuclear translocation and the initiation of SHH target gene expression (caballe2015ulk3regulatescytokinetic pages 2-3, saleiro2016beyondautophagynew pages 7-10). Experimental mutagenesis studies have identified specific phosphorylation sites within the kinase domain that play a regulatory role; for example, phosphomimetic mutations at serine residues S134 and S176 have been shown to significantly reduce ULK3’s catalytic activity, indicating that phosphorylation at these sites exerts an inhibitory effect (kasak2018characterizationofprotein pages 16-18, kasak2018characterizationofprotein pages 22-23).  
In addition to regulation by phosphorylation and protein–protein interactions, ULK3 is also modulated by binding of small molecule inhibitors. SU6668, initially developed as an inhibitor for receptor tyrosine kinases, has been found to inhibit ULK3 through binding at the ATP-binding cleft. Its action, which exhibits characteristics of both ATP-competitive and non-competitive inhibition, reveals an additional layer of regulatory control that could be exploited therapeutically in conditions where ULK3 activity is aberrant (kasak2018characterizationofprotein pages 23-26, karmacharya2023smallmoleculeinhibitors pages 12-14).  
These regulatory mechanisms are essential for maintaining the proper balance between the inactive and active states of the kinase. By integrating cues from both upstream signaling events—such as the availability of SHH ligand—and intrinsic modifications like autophosphorylation, ULK3 can execute its function in a context-dependent manner. This dual regulation ensures that ULK3 activity is precisely tuned to regulate processes such as autophagy induction during cellular senescence and the activation of GLI transcription factors in SHH signaling (caballe2015ulk3regulatescytokinetic pages 2-3, maloverjan2010identificationofa pages 6-9).

7. Function  
ULK3 serves as a crucial regulator of two pivotal cellular pathways: Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling and autophagy. In the realm of SHH signaling, ULK3 exerts both inhibitory and stimulatory influences depending on the extracellular context. Under basal conditions, when the SHH ligand is absent, ULK3 associates with SUFU, which leads to the suppression of its kinase activity. This interaction prevents the phosphorylation of GLI transcription factors, thus keeping the SHH signaling pathway in an inactive state (maloverjan2010identificationofa pages 1-2, montagnani2019roleofprotein pages 7-8).  
Conversely, in the presence of the SHH ligand, ULK3 dissociates from SUFU. Subsequent autophosphorylation of ULK3 triggers its kinase activity, enabling the phosphorylation of GLI2—a key transcription factor within the SHH pathway. Phosphorylated GLI2 then translocates to the nucleus, where it activates the transcription of target genes that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and developmental processes (caballe2015ulk3regulatescytokinetic pages 2-3, maloverjan2010identificationofa pages 4-6).  
In addition to its role in SHH signaling, ULK3 is implicated in the regulation of autophagy, particularly during cellular senescence. Experimental evidence indicates that ULK3 can induce autophagy as part of the cellular clearance mechanism, which is essential for degrading damaged proteins and organelles in senescent cells. This autophagic effect is likely mediated through the phosphorylation of substrates that regulate autophagosome formation, although the precise molecular targets in the context of autophagy remain to be fully elucidated (karmacharya2023smallmoleculeinhibitors pages 2-5, saleiro2016beyondautophagynew pages 7-10).  
Furthermore, ULK3 has been linked to cytokinetic abscission through its phosphorylation of ESCRT-III proteins, underscoring its role in ensuring proper cell division and genomic stability (caballe2015ulk3regulatescytokinetic pages 2-3). Tissue expression studies have revealed that ULK3 is present in multiple tissues, with relatively higher levels detected in the fetal brain and select adult tissues. Such expression patterns support the notion that ULK3 may contribute to neurodevelopmental processes as well as to the maintenance of adult tissue homeostasis (maloverjan2010identificationofa pages 4-6).  
Thus, ULK3 occupies a central position at the intersection of autophagy and developmental signaling pathways, facilitating the cellular response to environmental cues and stress conditions by modulating both the SHH pathway and autophagy machinery (montagnani2019roleofprotein pages 7-8, dorsey2009mappingthephosphorylation pages 8-10).

8. Other Comments  
In addition to its fundamental roles in signal transduction, several studies have explored the potential of ULK3 as a therapeutic target due to its involvement in both SHH signaling and autophagy. Small molecule inhibitors, such as SU6668, have been characterized for their ability to bind the ATP-binding pocket of ULK3, thereby inhibiting its kinase activity. SU6668 exhibits a mixed inhibition profile that is partially ATP competitive, highlighting the structural features of ULK3 that can be exploited for drug design (kasak2018characterizationofprotein pages 23-26, karmacharya2023smallmoleculeinhibitors pages 12-14).  
Given the pivotal role of the SHH pathway in developmental processes and its dysregulation in various cancers, ULK3’s capacity to modulate GLI transcription factors positions it as an interesting candidate in oncology research. Abnormal activation of SHH signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several tumor types, and ULK3’s dual regulatory mechanism—acting as a negative regulator in the absence of SHH and as a positive regulator when SHH is present—suggests that subtle alterations in its activity could have significant biological consequences (maloverjan2010identificationofa pages 1-2, saleiro2016beyondautophagynew pages 7-10).  
Furthermore, the induction of autophagy by ULK3 during cellular senescence may relate to the cellular quality control mechanisms that are vital in aging and age-associated diseases. The intersection of autophagy and SHH signaling pathways through ULK3 provides a molecular rationale for developing strategies to modulate these processes using small molecules or genetic interventions in disease contexts where aberrant autophagy or developmental signaling is observed (karmacharya2023smallmoleculeinhibitors pages 2-5, montagnani2019roleofprotein pages 7-8).  
The current body of literature indicates that although the precise consensus substrate motifs for ULK3 remain to be fully delineated, its substrate specificity is functionally defined by its ability to phosphorylate key regulatory proteins such as GLI transcription factors and ESCRT-III proteins. This, together with its unique structural configuration—as evidenced by the presence of tandem MIT domains and a non-RD kinase domain—underscores the multifaceted regulatory potential of ULK3 in both homeostatic and stress-related cellular pathways (caballe2015ulk3regulatescytokinetic pages 2-3, maloverjan2010identificationofa pages 6-9).  
Despite significant progress in characterizing ULK3, further investigations are warranted to fully elucidate its substrate preferences, regulatory mechanisms, and roles in human disease. Such insights will be critical for the rational design of inhibitors and therapeutic strategies intended to modulate ULK3 activity in pathological conditions.
