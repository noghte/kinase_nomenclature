1. Phylogeny  
ALPK1 is a member of the atypical alpha‐kinase family within the human serine/threonine kinome. Unlike conventional kinases, its catalytic domain is structurally homologous to Dictyostelium myosin heavy chain kinases yet shows significant divergence at the sequence level. Orthologs of ALPK1 have been primarily identified in vertebrates, and phylogenetic analyses place it in a distinct cluster of alpha kinases that also includes family members such as ALPK2 and ALPK3. This grouping distinguishes ALPK1 from classical protein kinases and reflects the evolutionary adaptation of innate immune signaling in higher organisms (garciaweber2021adpheptoseabacterial pages 5-7, johnson2023anatlasof pages 1-2, ko2022systematicreviewof pages 1-2).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
ALPK1 catalyzes a phosphorylation reaction typical of serine/threonine protein kinases. In its core reaction, a phosphate group is transferred from ATP to suitable hydroxyl groups on substrate proteins. The chemical reaction can be summarized as follows:  
  ATP + [protein] – OH → ADP + [protein] – O‑phosphate + H⁺  
For ALPK1, the principal target identified is the adaptor protein TIFA, where phosphorylation occurs on specific threonine residues (snelling2023alpk1mutantscausing pages 1-2).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
As with many protein kinases, ALPK1 requires divalent metal ion cofactors to facilitate phosphoryl transfer. In particular, Mg²⁺ is necessary to coordinate the ATP molecule and stabilize the transition state during the catalytic cycle. The presence of magnesium ions in the kinase active site is essential for its enzymatic function (snelling2023alpk1mutantscausing pages 6-7).

4. Substrate Specificity  
ALPK1 exhibits a defined substrate specificity that is primarily characterized by its phosphorylation of TIFA, an adaptor protein involved in initiating inflammatory signaling. Detailed in vitro studies have shown that ALPK1 not only phosphorylates TIFA at threonine 9 (T9)—a modification critical for promoting TIFA oligomerization (TIFAsome assembly) and downstream NF-κB signaling—but also phosphorylates additional threonine residues (T2, T12, and T19) with lower efficiency (garciaweber2023invitroalpk1kinase pages 1-5).  
Peptide array analyses and positional scanning studies of related serine/threonine kinases suggest that ALPK1, like other alpha kinases, tends to recognize substrates that present an alpha-helical conformation in the region surrounding the phosphoacceptor site. Complementary data from a kinome-wide substrate atlas indicate that the alpha kinase subgroup, which includes ALPK1, tends to favor basophilic motifs with enrichment of basic residues proximal to the phosphorylation site (johnson2023anatlasof pages 12-18, cho2020reclassificationofserinethreonine pages 41-46). Although an explicit consensus sequence for ALPK1 has not been fully delineated in these reports, its selectivity for specific threonine residues within substrates such as TIFA directly links its activity to the initiation of innate immune responses (garciaweber2021adpheptoseabacterial pages 5-7).

5. Structure  
The three-dimensional organization of ALPK1 comprises a modular architecture with three principal regions. The N-terminal portion is an alpha-helical domain that folds into a solenoid structure; this region contains the ADP-heptose binding pocket responsible for detecting bacterial nucleotide sugars. Structural studies employing crystallographic analysis and AlphaFold2 modeling suggest that up to 18 alpha-helices arrange into a right-handed solenoid, forming a concave surface that accommodates the ligand (garciaweber2021adpheptoseabacterial pages 5-7, snelling2023alpk1mutantscausing pages 6-6).  
Following the N-terminal region is an intrinsically disordered linker that is presumed to provide the necessary flexibility between the regulatory and catalytic modules. The C-terminal portion of ALPK1 constitutes its catalytic alpha-kinase domain, which adopts a fold similar to other members of the alpha kinase family. Within this kinase domain are key structural features required for catalysis, including the activation loop, a properly positioned C-helix, and the hydrophobic spines that are characteristic of active kinases. These features coordinate the binding of ATP, facilitate the phosphotransfer reaction, and undergo conformational rearrangement upon activation (garciaweber2023invitroalpk1kinase pages 1-5, johnson2023anatlasof pages 4-5).

6. Regulation  
ALPK1 regulation is mediated by ligand binding and autophosphorylation mechanisms. The innate immune function of ALPK1 is initiated by the binding of ADP-D-glycero-β-D-manno-heptose (ADP-heptose) to its N-terminal alpha-helical domain. This interaction induces a conformational change that exposes and activates the kinase domain, thereby facilitating both autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of downstream targets such as TIFA (garciaweber2021adpheptoseabacterial pages 5-7, garciaweber2023invitroalpk1kinase pages 10-13).  
In addition, studies have identified disease-associated mutations—including T237M and V1092A—that perturb ALPK1’s regulatory balance. Mutations in the ADP-heptose binding domain (such as T237M) affect ligand interaction, while alterations in the catalytic domain (such as V1092A) enhance the kinase’s activity, sometimes leading to constitutive phosphorylation of TIFA even in the absence of ligand. These mutations result in dysregulated NF‑κB signaling, providing a molecular basis for the autoinflammatory phenotypes observed in affected individuals (snelling2023alpk1mutantscausing pages 2-2, snelling2023alpk1mutantscausing pages 6-7).  
The activation state of ALPK1 is further modulated by its autophosphorylation events, which are detectable in vitro using thiophosphorylation assays. Such post-translational modifications serve as both markers of activation and as regulatory checkpoints that can influence substrate recognition and overall signaling output (garciaweber2023invitroalpk1kinase pages 10-13, xue2018alpk1innateattraction pages 2-2).

7. Function  
ALPK1 functions as a critical mediator of the innate immune response. It serves as a cytosolic receptor for the bacterial PAMP ADP-heptose, a nucleotide sugar present in Gram-negative (and some Gram-positive) bacteria. Upon recognition of ADP-heptose, ALPK1 becomes activated and initiates a phosphorylation cascade by targeting the adaptor protein TIFA. Phosphorylation of TIFA at threonine 9 is a key event that promotes TIFA oligomerization into higher order structures known as TIFAsomes; these complexes subsequently recruit and activate the NF‑κB signaling cascade, culminating in the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes (garciaweber2021adpheptoseabacterial pages 5-7, garciaweber2023invitroalpk1kinase pages 1-5, snelling2023alpk1mutantscausing pages 1-2).  
Beyond its well-established role in bacterial sensing, ALPK1 is implicated in additional cellular processes. It may contribute to monosodium urate monohydrate (MSU)‐induced inflammation through the phosphorylation of unconventional myosin MYO9A and is suggested to participate in apical protein transport by mediating phosphorylation of unconventional myosin MYO1A. Furthermore, ALPK1 has been associated with functions in ciliogenesis as indicated by studies examining its broader regulatory roles in cellular trafficking (Information section).  
The engagement of ALPK1 in these diverse cellular processes is underscored by its tissue expression pattern, which includes lymphocytes and epithelial cells—cell types that are central to barrier defense and immune surveillance. Activation of ALPK1 triggers signaling pathways that not only lead to NF‑κB activation but also intersect with other regulatory circuits involved in inflammation and cell motility, thereby linking microbial recognition to broader host defense mechanisms (xue2018alpk1innateattraction pages 2-2, ko2022systematicreviewof pages 2-4).

8. Other Comments  
ALPK1 is of considerable clinical interest because its hyperactivation, as seen in disease-associated mutants, has been linked to autoinflammatory conditions such as ROSAH syndrome and spiradenomas. Mutations that affect the ligand-binding region or the catalytic domain can lead to enhanced or constitutive kinase activity with downstream effects on NF‑κB signaling and inflammatory gene transcription (snelling2023alpk1mutantscausing pages 1-2, ko2022systematicreviewof pages 10-12).  
In addition to its role as a bacterial sensor, ALPK1 is emerging as a potential regulator of other cellular processes, including apical protein transport and cytoskeletal dynamics, via phosphorylation of unconventional myosins. Although specific small-molecule inhibitors targeting ALPK1 have not been widely established, its central role in initiating pro-inflammatory signaling makes it an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in inflammatory and cancer-related conditions. Current research efforts are focused on developing agents that can modulate ALPK1 activity and thereby attenuate aberrant inflammatory responses (snelling2023alpk1mutantscausing pages 6-7, ko2022systematicreviewof pages 5-7).
