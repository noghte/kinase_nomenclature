1. Phylogeny  
Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type 1G (CaMK1γ), encoded by CAMK1G and also known as CaMK-like CREB kinase III or CLICK3, is a member of the CaMK1 subfamily of serine/threonine protein kinases. This group belongs to the larger family of Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent kinases that are phylogenetically conserved across metazoan species, with orthologs identifiable in vertebrates ranging from fish to mammals (brzozowski2019themultifunctionalcalciumcalmodulin pages 23-24). Sequence analysis reveals that CaMK1γ preserves a conserved catalytic domain common to CaMK1 isoforms, while its regulatory modules show divergence that underlies tissue-specific functions and subcellular localization. Evolutionary studies have demonstrated that the CaMK1 family emerged from an ancestral CaMK gene early in eukaryotic evolution, and subsequent gene duplication and domain shuffling events gave rise to distinct isoforms that now mediate cell type–specific calcium signaling (ohmae2006molecularidentificationand pages 13-14). In addition, phylogenetic comparisons within the human kinome show that the CaMK1 isoforms are closely related to other Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent kinases such as CaMKIV and the multifunctional CaMKII, yet they diverge structurally in terms of regulatory sequences and, in the case of CaMK1γ, possess a unique C-terminal extension that includes a CAAX motif (brzozowski2019themultifunctionalcalciumcalmodulin pages 21-23). Such evolutionary distinctions underscore the specialized roles that each isoform plays in intracellular signaling, while maintaining the core features necessary for catalytic activity and calmodulin-mediated regulation (hook2001ca2+camdependentkinasesfrom pages 7-9).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
CaMK1γ catalyzes the transfer of the γ-phosphate group from ATP to serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins, following the general kinase reaction: ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (swulius2008ca2+calmodulindependentproteinkinases pages 2-4). This phosphorylation reaction is central to calcium-dependent signal transduction, as the post-translational modification modulates the functional state of substrate proteins by altering their conformation, activity, or interactions with downstream effectors (brzozowski2019themultifunctionalcalciumcalmodulin pages 4-7).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The catalytic activity of CaMK1γ is strictly dependent on the presence of divalent cations, with Mg²⁺ serving as the primary cofactor that facilitates ATP binding and proper positioning of the phosphate group during the phosphoryl transfer reaction (swulius2008ca2+calmodulindependentproteinkinases pages 2-4). In addition, while Ca²⁺ itself is not directly used in the chemical reaction, its binding to calmodulin is essential for the activation of CaMK1γ, thereby indirectly modulating catalytic activity (brzozowski2019themultifunctionalcalciumcalmodulin pages 19-21).

4. Substrate Specificity  
CaMK1γ exhibits substrate specificity characteristic of Ca²⁺/calmodulin‐dependent protein kinases, preferentially phosphorylating serine/threonine residues within substrates that typically display a defined consensus motif. Although the detailed consensus sequence has not been fully characterized for CaMK1γ, data from related CaMKs indicate that a requirement for a basic residue upstream (often at the –3 position relative to the phosphoacceptor) is commonly observed (hook2001ca2+camdependentkinasesfrom pages 7-9). Furthermore, by similarity to other family members, CaMK1γ is capable of phosphorylating transcription factors such as CREB1, thereby linking Ca²⁺/calmodulin signaling to gene transcription events (brzozowski2019themultifunctionalcalciumcalmodulin pages 23-24).

5. Structure  
The domain organization of CaMK1γ is characterized by a central catalytic (kinase) domain that exhibits the classical bilobal structure of serine/threonine kinases, with an N-terminal lobe composed primarily of β-sheets and a C-terminal lobe dominated by α-helical elements. Within the N-terminal lobe is a glycine-rich loop (or p-loop) that plays an essential role in ATP coordination, while key catalytic residues, including a conserved lysine involved in phosphate transfer and a catalytic aspartate within the DFG motif, are localized to the C-terminal lobe (swulius2008ca2+calmodulindependentproteinkinases pages 2-4). Immediately following the catalytic domain, CaMK1γ contains a regulatory domain that comprises overlapping autoinhibitory (AID) and calmodulin-binding (CBD) regions; in the absence of Ca²⁺, the AID occupies the substrate-binding cleft in a pseudosubstrate-like manner, thereby maintaining the kinase in an inactive conformation (hook2001ca2+camdependentkinasesfrom pages 5-7). A distinguishing structural feature of CaMK1γ is its extended C-terminal region that terminates with a CAAX motif; this sequence is a signal for prenylation, a lipid modification that anchors the kinase to cellular membranes and is critical for its proper subcellular localization (brzozowski2019themultifunctionalcalciumcalmodulin pages 21-23). In contrast to multimeric kinases such as CaMKII—which forms dodecameric assemblies—CaMK1 isoforms are typically monomeric, a structural arrangement that contributes to their precise regulation by Ca²⁺/calmodulin (hook2001ca2+camdependentkinasesfrom pages 7-9).

6. Regulation  
The regulatory mechanisms governing CaMK1γ activity are multifaceted and are primarily centered on its interaction with Ca²⁺/calmodulin and phosphorylation events. Under basal intracellular calcium concentrations, the enzyme remains autoinhibited by its regulatory domain, wherein the autoinhibitory segment blocks substrate access to the active site (hook2001ca2+camdependentkinasesfrom pages 5-7). Upon cellular stimulation that results in an increase in Ca²⁺ levels, calmodulin binds to CaMK1γ with high affinity, inducing a conformational change that displaces the autoinhibitory domain and exposes the catalytic site (brzozowski2019themultifunctionalcalciumcalmodulin pages 19-21). Full activation of CaMK1γ then requires phosphorylation of a conserved threonine residue located within its activation loop; this phosphorylation event is mediated by upstream CaM kinase kinases (CaMKK) and serves to further enhance kinase catalytic efficiency by stabilizing the active conformation of the enzyme (brzozowski2019themultifunctionalcalciumcalmodulin pages 19-21). In addition, regulatory cross-talk with other signaling cascades, such as those involving cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), may modulate CaMK1γ activity by influencing its phosphorylation state or calmodulin binding (brzozowski2019themultifunctionalcalciumcalmodulin pages 19-21). These mechanisms collectively ensure that CaMK1γ activity is tightly coupled to intracellular calcium dynamics and that its activation occurs only under appropriate signaling conditions.

7. Function  
CaMK1γ plays a pivotal role in transducing Ca²⁺ signals into cellular responses by phosphorylating target substrates that regulate gene expression and neuronal plasticity. Predominantly expressed in neuronal tissues, CaMK1γ is involved in the regulation of dendritic growth, axon elongation, and other aspects of neuronal differentiation that are critical for the development and maintenance of the central nervous system (brzozowski2019themultifunctionalcalciumcalmodulin pages 21-23). In vitro studies have demonstrated that CaMK1γ can phosphorylate the transcription factor CREB1, thereby linking calcium signals to the activation of CREB-dependent gene expression programs (cohen2016excitationtranscriptioncouplingin pages 17-17). This functional coupling is integral to processes such as synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory formation. Beyond its neuronal roles, evidence suggests that CaMK1γ signaling may also contribute to cell cycle regulation and survival pathways, with aberrant activity of CaMK family members being implicated in various types of cancer; dysregulation of CaMK1γ in particular has been correlated with enhanced proliferation, migration, and invasion in tumor cells (brzozowski2019themultifunctionalcalciumcalmodulin pages 23-24). Thus, CaMK1γ occupies a central position in calcium-dependent signaling networks that modulate both normal physiological functions and pathological processes.

8. Other Comments  
At present, no highly specific small molecule inhibitors have been conclusively identified that target CaMK1γ directly. Instead, current experimental strategies have focused on modulating its activity indirectly by targeting upstream regulators such as CaMKK or by interfering with its binding to calmodulin (brzozowski2019themultifunctionalcalciumcalmodulin pages 19-21). The unique membrane anchoring conferred by the CAAX motif represents a distinctive feature that may be exploited in the future to develop strategies aimed at altering its subcellular localization and function. Dysregulation of CaMK1γ has been associated with oncogenic processes in several studies, and its role in coupling Ca²⁺ signals to transcriptional regulation makes it a potential target for therapeutic intervention in cancers where calcium signaling is aberrant (brzozowski2019themultifunctionalcalciumcalmodulin pages 23-24, cohen2016excitationtranscriptioncouplingin pages 17-17). Furthermore, while most functional studies have focused on its role in neuronal physiology, emerging evidence suggests that its expression and activity in non-neuronal tissues may also influence other cellular processes; however, additional research using selective pharmacological agents will be required to delineate these roles further (beghi2022calciumsignallingin pages 9-11).
