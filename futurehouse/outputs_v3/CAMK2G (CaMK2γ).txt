1. Phylogeny  
CaMKIIγ, encoded by the CAMK2G gene, is one of the four isoforms of calcium/calmodulin‐dependent protein kinase II found in mammals. All CaMKII isoforms share a highly conserved N‐terminal catalytic domain and a C‐terminal association domain while diverging mainly in their variable linker regions; these differences contribute to their tissue‐selective expression and functional specialization. CaMKIIγ belongs to the serine/threonine kinase superfamily and is evolutionarily closely related to the α, β, and δ isoforms found across vertebrates and invertebrates, a relationship that traces back to early eukaryotic ancestors and is supported by comparative genomic analyses of kinase families (hudmon2002structure–functionofthe pages 2-3, stratton2013structuralstudieson pages 1-2, yasuda2022camkiiacentral pages 1-2). Phylogenetic studies have demonstrated that the CaMKII family was established through gene duplication events, resulting in multiple isoforms with overlapping catalytic functions yet distinct regulatory and targeting features that are evident in the differential expression patterns observed in neuronal versus muscle tissues (mohanan2022roleofca2+calmodulindependent pages 1-2, rostas2023calciumcalmodulinstimulatedproteinkinase pages 1-2).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
CaMKIIγ functions as a serine/threonine protein kinase that catalyzes the transfer of the γ-phosphate from ATP onto the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues in protein substrates. In its catalytic reaction, ATP and a protein substrate react to yield ADP and a phosphorylated protein along with the release of a proton. This phosphorylation reaction is inherently coupled to the enzyme’s activation by Ca²⁺ bound to calmodulin, triggering the conformational changes necessary for efficient substrate phosphorylation (zhang2021calciumcalmodulin–dependentproteinkinase pages 1-2, hudmon2002structure–functionofthe pages 2-3, swulius2008ca2+calmodulindependentproteinkinases pages 2-4).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The catalytic activity of CaMKIIγ is dependent on the presence of Mg²⁺, which acts as an essential cofactor for ATP binding and phosphotransfer reactions. In addition to Mg²⁺, CaMKIIγ function is tightly regulated by the binding of Ca²⁺ to calmodulin; this Ca²⁺/calmodulin complex is required to relieve the autoinhibitory constraints on the kinase, thereby enabling its activation (swulius2008ca2+calmodulindependentproteinkinases pages 1-2, hudmon2002structure–functionofthe pages 2-3).

4. Substrate Specificity  
CaMKIIγ exhibits substrate specificity that is characteristic of many Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine kinases. Substrates typically possess a consensus motif featuring a serine or threonine residue flanked by basic amino acids, often conforming to an RXXS/T motif and sometimes a hydrophobic residue immediately following the phosphorylated site. The enzyme recognizes its substrates via docking interactions that involve its catalytic and regulatory domains, thus ensuring precise phosphorylation of proteins that are critical for functions such as synaptic modulation and Ca²⁺ homeostasis (zhang2021calciumcalmodulin–dependentproteinkinase pages 1-2, swulius2008ca2+calmodulindependentproteinkinases pages 9-10).

5. Structure  
CaMKIIγ is organized into four principal domains that define its overall three-dimensional architecture. The N-terminal catalytic domain contains the conserved ATP binding site and the active site necessary for phosphotransfer. Adjacent to the catalytic domain is the regulatory domain, which includes the autoinhibitory sequence and the calmodulin-binding region; in the basal state, this regulatory segment masks the catalytic cleft and prevents substrate access. Following the regulatory domain is the variable linker region, whose length and sequence vary among the CaMKII isoforms due to alternative splicing, thereby influencing the enzyme’s flexibility and subcellular targeting. The C-terminal association (hub) domain mediates oligomerization into dodecameric holoenzymes, typically arranged as two stacked hexameric rings that facilitate intersubunit interactions required for autophosphorylation (stratton2013structuralstudieson pages 2-4, bhattacharyya2020structuralinsightsinto pages 5-6, swulius2008ca2+calmodulindependentproteinkinases pages 9-10). Key catalytic features include an activation loop that undergoes autophosphorylation (at a threonine residue corresponding to Thr287 in CaMKIIγ) and a hydrophobic spine whose integrity is essential for full enzymatic activity. The holoenzyme’s assembly into a donut-shaped complex supports cooperative activation and the propagation of autonomous kinase activity through intersubunit phosphotransfer (stratton2013structuralstudieson pages 8-10, hudmon2002structure–functionofthe pages 2-3, rostas2023calciumcalmodulinstimulatedproteinkinase pages 12-14).

6. Regulation  
The activity of CaMKIIγ is tightly controlled by several regulatory mechanisms that modulate both its catalytic activity and its subcellular localization. Activation is initiated by the binding of Ca²⁺ to calmodulin, which interacts with the autoinhibitory regulatory domain, lifting the inhibitory constraints and exposing the active site for substrate access. Subsequently, autophosphorylation occurs at a critical threonine residue (Thr287 in CaMKIIγ, analogous to Thr286 in the α isoform), a modification that confers partial Ca²⁺/calmodulin-independent autonomous activity. This autophosphorylation not only serves as a molecular memory of prior Ca²⁺ signals but also increases the affinity of the enzyme for calmodulin, a process sometimes referred to as “calmodulin trapping” (mohanan2022roleofca2+calmodulindependent pages 17-19, rostas2023calciumcalmodulinstimulatedproteinkinase pages 15-17). In addition, phosphorylation at inhibitory sites (corresponding to Thr305/306 in other isoforms) can prevent further calmodulin binding, thus setting a threshold for reactivation. Other post-translational modifications—including oxidation, nitrosylation, and glycosylation—have been reported in related CaMKII isoforms; although specific modifications for CaMKIIγ are less well documented, similar mechanisms are presumed to contribute to its fine-tuning in response to cellular redox states and metabolic cues. Overall, these layers of regulation enable CaMKIIγ to decode complex Ca²⁺ signaling patterns and modulate its activity in a spatiotemporally precise manner (bhattacharyya2020structuralinsightsinto pages 15-16, swulius2008ca2+calmodulindependentproteinkinases pages 4-6, ma2015distinctrolesof pages 6-7).

7. Function  
CaMKIIγ plays diverse roles in both the muscle and nervous systems. In skeletal muscle, it is involved in the regulation of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ transport, where in slow-twitch fibers it modulates Ca²⁺ reuptake and in fast-twitch fibers it participates in the control of Ca²⁺ release by phosphorylating key components of the excitation–contraction coupling machinery, such as the ryanodine receptor-coupling factor triadin. In the central nervous system, CaMKIIγ contributes to dendritic spine and synapse formation and is essential for the maintenance of synaptic plasticity underlying long-term potentiation (LTP) and hippocampus-dependent learning. The enzyme regulates neurite formation and arborization during development and has been shown to mediate excitation-to-transcription (E-T) coupling by translocating Ca²⁺/calmodulin signals to the nucleus, thereby influencing gene expression programs critical for synaptic strength and memory consolidation. Furthermore, in response to interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) stimulation, CaMKIIγ catalyzes the phosphorylation of STAT1, linking it to cytokine signaling pathways (ma2015distinctrolesof pages 4-6, ma2015distinctrolesof pages 6-7, mohanan2022roleofca2+calmodulindependent pages 22-22, yasuda2022camkiiacentral pages 13-14).

8. Other Comments  
CaMKIIγ is a promising pharmacological target given its central role in Ca²⁺ signaling across different tissues. Experimental inhibitors such as KN-93 have been used to probe CaMKII function in various cellular contexts; however, challenges regarding specificity remain. Dysregulation of CaMKIIγ has been implicated in neurological disorders, including intellectual disabilities, abnormal dendritic development, and synaptic dysfunction, as well as in muscle pathologies affecting Ca²⁺ homeostasis. The existence of multiple splice variants of CAMK2G further contributes to its functional diversity by altering calmodulin affinity, subcellular localization, and interaction with distinct protein partners. Recent advances in molecular imaging tools and the development of photoactivatable inhibitors have enabled detailed spatiotemporal dissection of CaMKII activity in live cells, highlighting its role as a dynamic mediator of cellular memory and signaling (gangopadhyay2003differentialfunctionalproperties pages 10-10, mohanan2022roleofca2+calmodulindependent pages 19-20, forest2008roleofthe pages 12-14, huang2014metaboliccontrolof pages 73-79, sanhueza2016camkiiamaster pages 1-4).
