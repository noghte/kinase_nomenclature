1. Phylogeny  
MRCKα (CDC42BPA) is a serine/threonine kinase that belongs to a subfamily within the DMPK/ROCK group of AGC kinases and is evolutionarily conserved across mammalian species (leung1998myotonicdystrophykinaserelated pages 1-2, clayton2020targetingrhogtpase pages 7-8, krupa2002therepertoireof pages 1-2). It is grouped with paralogous kinases—namely MRCKβ and MRCKγ—which share considerable sequence similarity in their catalytic domains, although MRCKγ displays a more restricted tissue expression profile (leung1998myotonicdystrophykinaserelated pages 1-2). MRCKα is evolutionarily related to Rho-associated kinases (ROCKs) while remaining functionally distinct; both families share several substrates and catalytic features yet have diverged in regulatory mechanisms and domain organization (clayton2020targetingrhogtpase pages 7-8, leung1998myotonicdystrophykinaserelated pages 2-6). In addition, it forms part of an evolutionary core of kinases activated downstream of Rho GTPases, which includes numerous effectors that have been conserved from the common eukaryotic ancestor (mosaddeghzadeh2021therhofamily pages 12-14).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
MRCKα catalyzes the transfer of the γ-phosphate from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues on its substrate proteins, thereby converting the substrate into a phosphoprotein and generating ADP and a proton as byproducts (leung1998myotonicdystrophykinaserelated pages 2-6). This fundamental phosphoryl transfer reaction is central to its role as a signaling enzyme that modulates downstream cellular processes (leung1998myotonicdystrophykinaserelated pages 2-6).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The phosphorylation reaction carried out by MRCKα is dependent on the binding of ATP in the presence of divalent cations, with Mg²⁺ being essential for catalysis (leung1998myotonicdystrophykinaserelated pages 2-6). In some experimental conditions, Mn²⁺ can act as an additional cofactor to support or modulate activity, a common requirement among serine/threonine kinases of the AGC family (leung1998myotonicdystrophykinaserelated pages 2-6).

4. Substrate Specificity  
MRCKα displays substrate specificity toward proteins that regulate cytoskeletal organization. Its well‐characterized substrates include non‐muscle myosin light chain (MLC2/MYL9), which is phosphorylated predominantly at serine 19, and regulatory subunits such as PPP1R12A (MYPT1) that modulate myosin phosphatase activity (clayton2020targetingrhogtpase pages 7-8, leung1998myotonicdystrophykinaserelated pages 1-2). In addition, MRCKα phosphorylates LIM domain kinases (LIMK1 and LIMK2), thereby influencing actin filament dynamics and stabilizing actomyosin contractility (leung1998myotonicdystrophykinaserelated pages 2-6). Although a detailed consensus phosphorylation motif has not been definitively established in the literature, the pattern of activity is consistent with a preference for serine/threonine residues in substrates that possess regulatory domains linked to cytoskeletal dynamics (chetty2022rhofamilygtpase pages 3-4).

5. Structure  
MRCKα is a multidomain protein with a distinct structural organization that underpins its regulatory and catalytic functions. At its N-terminus lies the conserved serine/threonine kinase domain that contains the characteristic catalytic motifs—including a glycine-rich loop, a conserved catalytic lysine, and an activation loop known to undergo autophosphorylation (e.g., at Ser1003) (clayton2020targetingrhogtpase pages 7-8, leung1998myotonicdystrophykinaserelated pages 9-10). Following the kinase domain, MRCKα contains a C1 domain that mediates membrane localization via binding to diacylglycerol or phorbol esters, and a pleckstrin homology (PH)-like domain that may facilitate interactions with membrane phospholipids (clayton2020targetingrhogtpase pages 7-8, leung1998myotonicdystrophykinaserelated pages 1-2). Further downstream, the citron homology (CH) domain is proposed to play a role in substrate docking and protein–protein interactions, while the C-terminal CRIB (Cdc42/Rac interactive binding) domain is integral for binding the active, GTP-loaded forms of CDC42 and, in some isoforms, Rac1 (leung1998myotonicdystrophykinaserelated pages 2-6, herpen2006myotronicdystrophyprotein pages 21-23). Although no full-length high-resolution crystal structure has been reported, the strong conservation of these domains with those found in related kinases (e.g., ROCK) supports the prediction of a similar overall three-dimensional fold comprising a bilobal kinase domain with regulatory elements that control accessibility to the catalytic cleft (thiriet2013cytoplasmicproteinserinethreonine pages 45-48).

6. Regulation  
The activity of MRCKα is tightly regulated by multiple mechanisms. A primary mode of activation involves binding of active, GTP-loaded CDC42 to the C-terminal CRIB domain, which induces conformational changes that relieve autoinhibitory interactions and promote membrane recruitment through the C1 and PH domains (clayton2020targetingrhogtpase pages 7-8, leung1998myotonicdystrophykinaserelated pages 9-10). Autophosphorylation events, notably the phosphorylation at Ser1003, serve as markers for full activation of the kinase and are critical for modulating its catalytic output (clayton2020targetingrhogtpase pages 7-8, leung1998myotonicdystrophykinaserelated pages 9-10). In addition, MRCKα may be regulated by interactions with other cellular proteins, such as MYO18A and LURAP1, which help to spatially organize the actomyosin machinery and further fine-tune its activity during processes related to cell protrusion and migration (clayton2020targetingrhogtpase pages 7-8, leung1998myotonicdystrophykinaserelated pages 6-9).

7. Function  
MRCKα functions as a critical downstream effector of the small GTPase CDC42 in mediating cytoskeletal reorganization and cell migration. By phosphorylating substrates such as non-muscle myosin light chain (MLC2), PPP1R12A (MYPT1), and LIM kinase isoforms, MRCKα directly modulates actomyosin contractility and actin filament turnover, processes that are essential for lamellar actomyosin retrograde flow and the formation of dynamic cellular protrusions (clayton2020targetingrhogtpase pages 7-8, leung1998myotonicdystrophykinaserelated pages 1-2). Its activity is linked to the modulation of cell polarity and directional migration, and it has been implicated in promoting invasive behavior in various human cancers, including squamous cell carcinoma (clayton2020targetingrhogtpase pages 7-8, bruneau2022mrckalphaandits pages 2-4). Furthermore, by partnering with proteins such as MYO18A and LURAP1, MRCKα is involved in the regulation of lamellar actomyosin dynamics that underpin cell protrusion formation in migratory cells (mosaddeghzadeh2021therhofamily pages 1-3).

8. Other Comments  
Recent pharmacological advances have led to the development of selective azaindole inhibitors that target MRCKα (and its close paralog MRCKβ) with high specificity over related kinases such as ROCK, resulting in effective reductions in MRCKα‐mediated myosin light chain phosphorylation and decreased cancer cell motility in preclinical models; however, issues such as systemic toxicity remain a concern (clayton2020targetingrhogtpase pages 7-8, kurimchak2020functionalproteomicsinterrogation pages 21-22). MRCKα expression is reported to be upregulated in several human cancers, and its activity has been linked to aggressive invasive phenotypes, thereby positioning it as a potential therapeutic target in oncology (bruneau2022mrckalphaandits pages 8-11). In addition, alternative splicing of the CDC42BPA gene contributes to the functional diversity of MRCKα isoforms, which may have distinct regulatory and tissue-specific roles (herpen2006myotronicdystrophyprotein pages 36-39).
