1. Phylogeny  
Cyclin-dependent kinase-like 2 (CDKL2) is a member of the CDKL subfamily that falls within the broader CMGC group of serine/threonine kinases. Members of the CDKL family include CDKL1, CDKL2, CDKL3, CDKL4, and CDKL5, all of which arise from gene duplication events early in metazoan evolution. Comparative sequence analysis reveals that the conserved N-terminal kinase domains of CDKL2 and its paralogs share moderate sequence identity with classical cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), establishing an evolutionary link to these well‐studied kinase families (canning2018cdklfamilykinases pages 1-3). Phylogenetic studies that have employed methods such as Bayesian inference and neighbor-joining consistently group CDKL2 in a discrete clade that, while sharing ancestral catalytic features with classic CDKs, has diverged significantly to acquire unique regulatory insertions and C-terminal extensions (martincarrascosa2025aphylogeneticanalysis pages 16-17). Orthologs of CDKL2 have been identified in a range of vertebrate species. The evolutionary trajectory of the CDKL family suggests that these kinases originally evolved to support functions beyond the regulation of cell cycle progression, with several family members, including CDKL2, implicated in the control of ciliary function and neuronal signal transduction (canning2018cdklfamilykinases pages 1-3, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 1-2). Detailed sequence alignments of the conserved kinase domain show that despite retaining essential catalytic residues, CDKL2 exhibits unique structural motifs – for example, a modified “PSTAIRE” helix motif that in CDKL2 is represented as “KKIAMRE” – which further underlines its specialized evolutionary path (endicott2013structuralcharacterizationof pages 3-5). In summary, within the human kinome, CDKL2 is classified as a distinct paralog that bridges the evolutionary gap between conventional cell cycle regulators and kinases involved in more specialized signaling pathways, a divergence that is reflected in its distribution across vertebrate species and its functional adaptations (martincarrascosa2025aphylogeneticanalysis pages 8-10).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
CDKL2 functions as an ATP-dependent serine/threonine kinase. It catalyzes the phosphorylation reaction that transfers the γ-phosphate group from ATP to specific serine or threonine residues on target proteins. In the canonical reaction, the binding of ATP at the active site enables the formation of a reactive phosphoryl donor that, upon nucleophilic attack by the hydroxyl group of the substrate serine or threonine, yields ADP along with a phosphorylated protein and a proton (canning2018cdklfamilykinases pages 4-5). This reaction is represented chemically as:  
  ATP + [protein]-(L‑serine or L‑threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L‑serine/threonine‑phosphate) + H⁺.  
The enzymatic activity of CDKL2 thus plays a critical role in regulating downstream signaling pathways by modifying the function, localization, or interaction properties of its substrates via phosphorylation (canning2018cdklfamilykinases pages 4-5).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The catalytic activity of CDKL2 is strictly dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions, particularly magnesium (Mg²⁺). Mg²⁺ is required to coordinate and stabilize the binding of ATP within the kinase’s active site, a role that is essential for promoting the nucleophilic attack on ATP’s γ-phosphate group during the phosphorylation reaction (canning2018cdklfamilykinases pages 8-9). The requirement for Mg²⁺ has been demonstrated under in vitro assay conditions where kinase activity is optimal only when the appropriate concentration of MgCl₂ is included in the reaction buffer (bashore2024discoveryandcharacterization pages 1-2). This cofactor dependency is a widely conserved feature among ATP-dependent serine/threonine kinases, ensuring that the phosphoryl transfer reaction proceeds with high fidelity and efficiency (bashore2024discoveryandcharacterization pages 1-2).

4. Substrate Specificity  
CDKL2 exhibits substrate specificity that is characteristic of proline-directed serine/threonine kinases within the CMGC group. Functional studies, particularly those performed in neuronal systems, have shown that CDKL2 phosphorylates substrates such as the microtubule-associated protein EB2 at serine 222. This phosphorylation event underlines the enzyme’s ability to recognize specific sequence motifs in its target proteins (silvestre2024celltypespecificexpression pages 9-10). Phosphoproteomic analyses of related family members, particularly CDKL5, suggest a prevalent substrate motif enriched in basic residues (for example, arginine) in positions upstream (−2 and −3) of the phosphoacceptor serine, typically conforming to an RXXS consensus motif (munoz2018phosphoproteomicscreeningidentifies pages 2-4). Although high-throughput substrate profiling for CDKL2 has not been as extensively published as for CDKL5, the evidence from these analyses supports the notion that CDKL2’s substrate recognition is likely dictated by a similar basic residue-enriched sequence motif that predisposes serine residues for phosphorylation, especially when they are immediately followed by a proline or are part of a protonated environment conducive to catalysis (silvestre2024celltypespecificexpression pages 9-10, munoz2018phosphoproteomicscreeningidentifies pages 4-5).

5. Structure  
The three-dimensional architecture of CDKL2 is defined by a conserved catalytic core that displays the typical bilobal structure observed in serine/threonine kinases. The N-terminal lobe of CDKL2 is comprised predominantly of β-strands intermingled with a critical αC-helix. This αC-helix is essential for the proper orientation of ATP within the active site and for positioning key catalytic residues. In particular, a highly conserved lysine residue within this lobe, analogous to Lys33 in CDK2, forms an indispensable salt bridge with a glutamate residue located in the αC-helix that is necessary for catalytic activity (endicott2013structuralcharacterizationof pages 3-5). The larger C-terminal lobe is composed mainly of α-helices and houses the substrate-binding region. A unique structural hallmark of CDKL2 is the presence of a distinct C-terminal αJ helix. This αJ helix, which appears to be absent in classical CDKs and MAPKs, occupies a portion of the substrate docking groove that is otherwise available in other kinases, thereby potentially modulating access of substrates to the active site (canning2018cdklfamilykinases pages 4-5, bashore2024discoveryandcharacterization pages 7-8). The kinase domain also features a variant of the traditional PSTAIRE helix motif; in CDKL2, this motif is substituted by KKIAMRE. Although this modification differentiates CDKL2 from canonical CDKs, it preserves the necessary interactions for ATP binding and catalytic transfer (endicott2013structuralcharacterizationof pages 3-5). Furthermore, crystallographic studies of CDKL2 in complex with ATP-competitive inhibitors have revealed that the enzyme often adopts an inactive “αC-out” conformation in these complexes, emphasizing the conformational transitions that occur during the activation process (canning2018cdklfamilykinases pages 8-9, bashore2024discoveryandcharacterization pages 1-2). In addition to the core kinase fold, CDKL2 possesses several variable C-terminal regions that may serve as regulatory modules or interaction interfaces for binding partner proteins, although experimental evidence has yet to confirm any specific cyclin interactions despite the presence of putative cyclin-binding domains (canning2018cdklfamilykinases pages 3-4, endicott2013structuralcharacterizationof pages 5-6). Overall, the structural organization of CDKL2 integrates a canonical bilobal arrangement with distinctive regulatory elements that likely contribute to its specialized substrate recognition and regulatory properties.

6. Regulation  
The regulation of CDKL2 activity is mediated by a confluence of post-translational modifications and conformational dynamics. A key regulatory event is the phosphorylation of a threonine residue within the activation segment of the kinase domain, analogous to the Thr160 position in canonical CDKs. Although the precise upstream kinase that mediates this phosphorylation in vivo has not been definitively identified, this modification is thought to stabilize the active configuration of the enzyme by facilitating alignment of the substrate-binding cleft (canning2018cdklfamilykinases pages 4-5, endicott2013structuralcharacterizationof pages 5-6). In addition to activation segment phosphorylation, CDKL2 appears to be regulated by intrinsic autophosphorylation events and modulation by small molecules; ATP-competitive inhibitors have been shown to trap CDKL2 in an inactive “αC-out” state, thereby highlighting the intrinsic conformational flexibility that underlies its regulatory control (bashore2024discoveryandcharacterization pages 7-8, canning2018cdklfamilykinases pages 8-9). Despite the identification of putative cyclin-binding motifs within its primary sequence, no experimental evidence confirms an association with cyclins. This suggests that unlike classical CDKs, CDKL2 regulation relies principally on phosphorylation and conformational changes rather than cyclin-dependent activation (canning2018cdklfamilykinases pages 3-4). Moreover, detailed molecular modelling and bioinformatics studies have uncovered several potential autophosphorylation sites in CDKL2; however, the functional outcomes of these modifications remain to be fully elucidated. The current regulatory model for CDKL2 emphasizes the cooperative roles of activation loop phosphorylation, conformational rearrangements—particularly involving the unique αJ helix—and competitive binding of ATP and inhibitors in fine-tuning its catalytic activity (shafiq2011molecularmodellingand pages 90-97). This sophisticated control mechanism ensures that CDKL2 reliably transduces phosphorylation signals only under appropriate cellular conditions.

7. Function  
Functionally, CDKL2 operates as an ATP-dependent serine/threonine kinase that is implicated in multiple intracellular signaling pathways. Its kinase activity is central to the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics and is closely associated with the maintenance of ciliary structure and function. Experimental studies have demonstrated that CDKL2 phosphorylates specific substrates, such as the microtubule-associated protein EB2, at serine 222—a post-translational modification that plays a role in modulating microtubule assembly and intracellular transport (silvestre2024celltypespecificexpression pages 9-10). The enzyme is expressed in a variety of tissues including the retina, testis, brain, lungs, and kidneys, suggesting that its functions are not confined solely to neuronal systems but extend to a broad spectrum of physiological processes (bashore2024discoveryandcharacterization pages 1-2). In neuronal cells, CDKL2 activity has been associated with the regulation of dendritic morphology and synaptic organization, functions that are essential for the maintenance of proper neuronal connectivity and plasticity (nawaz2013cdkl5affectsneuronal pages 34-36). Comparative genetic studies have further indicated that there may be partially overlapping substrate networks within the CDKL family, wherein CDKL2 can compensate for deficits in related kinases such as CDKL5, particularly in the context of neuronal signal transduction and cytoskeletal regulation (martincarrascosa2025aphylogeneticanalysis pages 8-10). In addition, the evolutionary conservation of CDKL2 among vertebrates supports its role in processes that are fundamental to cell polarity and microtubule organization, and its potential involvement in ciliary length regulation has been inferred from studies of lower eukaryotes where CDKL orthologs govern ciliary structure (canning2018cdklfamilykinases pages 1-3). Thus, CDKL2 is positioned as a key regulator of intracellular signaling pathways that oversee structural organization and protein trafficking in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells.

8. Other Comments  
Recent progress in chemical biology has facilitated the development of ATP-competitive inhibitors that target the active site of CDKL2. These inhibitors have been used to probe the biochemical properties of the kinase in vitro and provide valuable tools that may ultimately inform therapeutic strategies (bashore2024discoveryandcharacterization pages 7-8, bashore2024discoveryandcharacterization pages 8-9). Owing to its structural and functional similarities with CDKL5, there is substantial interest in exploring the potential of CDKL2 as a therapeutic target in pathological conditions where its kinase activity is aberrant. Notably, despite the presence of putative cyclin-binding domains in its primary sequence, experimental studies have yet to demonstrate any direct cyclin interaction for CDKL2. This observation reinforces the concept that CDKL2—like other members of the CDKL family—is regulated predominantly by phosphorylation events and intrinsic conformational changes rather than by classical cyclin-dependent mechanisms (canning2018cdklfamilykinases pages 3-4). Furthermore, high-resolution phosphoproteomic screening of related family members has elucidated consensus substrate motifs (for example, an RXXS motif) that are likely relevant to CDKL2’s substrate specificity, suggesting that further studies aimed at systematically mapping its in vivo substrates could provide additional functional insights (munoz2018phosphoproteomicscreeningidentifies pages 2-4). The broad tissue expression pattern and evolutionary conservation of CDKL2 underscore its importance in diverse cellular signaling networks, while its involvement in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics and ciliary function positions it as a candidate for further investigation in the context of neurodevelopmental and proliferative disorders. Continued efforts to characterize the complete repertoire of CDKL2 substrates and regulatory mechanisms are warranted, and the integration of complementary structural, biochemical, and phosphoproteomic data will be essential to fully realize the therapeutic potential of targeting this kinase.
