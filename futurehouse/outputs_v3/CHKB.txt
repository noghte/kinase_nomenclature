1. Phylogeny  
Choline/ethanolamine kinase beta (encoded by the CHKB gene, also referred to as CHETK or CHKL; UniProt Q9Y259) is a member of the choline/ethanolamine kinase family that is conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution. Comparative sequence analyses have demonstrated that members of this kinase family are present from lower eukaryotes such as Caenorhabditis elegans to higher mammals, indicating that the enzyme’s catalytic core has been maintained over hundreds of millions of years (kent2003multipleisoformsof pages 1-2, lai2016evolutionaryancestryof pages 2-3). In mammals, two major isoforms of choline kinase exist, known as CHKA and CHKB, with CHKB showing approximately 60% sequence homology with CHKA. This degree of sequence conservation suggests that while both isoforms share essential catalytic features required for phosphoryl transfer, they have diverged in aspects such as substrate preference and tissue‐specific expression. Phylogenetic reconstructions based on kinase domain alignments further situate choline/ethanolamine kinases in the larger context of the kinome, where they are often classified as atypical kinases because they share the overall eukaryotic protein kinase (ePK) fold yet lack certain regulatory segments common to canonical serine/threonine kinases (lai2016evolutionaryancestryof pages 2-3). Indeed, studies have traced the evolutionary ancestry of choline kinases back to a common ancestral kinase present in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA), a finding that corroborates the presence of similar catalytic subdomains in CHKB and other well‐characterized protein kinases. Orthologs of CHKB have been catalogued in various species, reinforcing its status as an enzyme with fundamental cellular roles; such orthologs have been well documented in model organisms and in human genome analyses performed by Manning and colleagues (OpenTargets Search: -CHKB). Phylogenetic evidence from multiple sequence alignments and domain architecture comparisons supports grouping CHKB with its choline kinase counterparts, all of which maintain a conserved catalytic core essential for lipid metabolism. The evolutionary conservation of these domains underscores the fundamental importance of choline/ethanolamine phosphorylation in membrane biogenesis and homeostasis. Thus, CHKB occupies a central phylogenetic position as a member of an enzyme family that arose early in eukaryotic evolution and has been retained in all metazoan lineages, where it performs nonredundant functions in specific tissues such as muscle and bone (kent2003multipleisoformsof pages 1-2, lai2016evolutionaryancestryof pages 2-3).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
The primary biochemical reaction catalyzed by CHKB is the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of the small molecules choline and ethanolamine. In this reaction, a phosphate group is transferred from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to either choline or ethanolamine, resulting in the formation of phosphocholine or phosphoethanolamine, respectively, along with the release of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and a proton. The overall reaction is represented as follows: ATP + choline (or ethanolamine) → ADP + phosphocholine (or phosphoethanolamine) + H⁺ (OpenTargets Search: -CHKB). This enzymatic activity is the initial and rate‐limiting step of the Kennedy pathway, which is responsible for the de novo biosynthesis of two major phospholipids—phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine—that are critical components of cellular membranes. The reaction catalyzed by CHKB is essential because it generates the activated intermediates required for subsequent enzymatic reactions that ultimately lead to the assembly of complex membrane lipids. Detailed biochemical studies on related choline kinases have confirmed that the mechanism proceeds via a sequential binding of substrates, with ATP binding and subsequent phosphoryl transfer occurring through an atypical ping–pong mechanism that does not require the formation of a ternary complex, but rather advances through a phosphorylated enzyme intermediate (OpenTargets Search: -CHKB). Moreover, the dual substrate specificity of CHKB, enabling phosphorylation of both choline and ethanolamine, positions it as a key regulatory node in determining the relative production of phosphatidylcholine versus phosphatidylethanolamine. This reaction forms the basis of phospholipid metabolism and is fundamental to membrane biogenesis and maintenance across all eukaryotic cells.

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The catalytic activity of CHKB is strictly dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions, with magnesium (Mg²⁺) being the essential cofactor. Mg²⁺ binds to ATP, neutralizing the negative charges on its phosphate groups, and thus facilitates proper alignment of the nucleotide within the enzyme’s active site to enable efficient phosphoryl transfer. Structural studies of human choline kinase, as detailed in crystallographic analyses of its isoforms, reveal that Mg²⁺ is coordinated by conserved amino acid residues within the ATP-binding cleft, demonstrating its fundamental role in the catalytic process (malito2006elucidationofhuman pages 4-5). The requirement for Mg²⁺ is a hallmark of many kinases, and in the context of CHKB, this cofactor ensures that the energy from ATP hydrolysis is effectively coupled to the phosphorylation of choline or ethanolamine. Although other divalent cations such as Mn²⁺ might support enzymatic activity in some kinases, the physiological and most efficient cofactor for CHKB remains Mg²⁺, which is indispensable for its proper function in vivo.

4. Substrate Specificity  
CHKB exhibits dual substrate specificity by phosphorylating both choline and ethanolamine; however, the relative catalytic efficiencies for these substrates differ between isoforms. Biochemical characterizations indicate that CHKB generally demonstrates a higher affinity and catalytic efficiency for ethanolamine compared to choline. This substrate preference is critical in tissues where the precise balance between phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis must be maintained to sustain membrane integrity and cellular function (arlauckas2016cholinekinasealpha—putting pages 3-4). For instance, kinetic assays performed on choline kinase isoforms from model organisms have revealed different Km values for choline and ethanolamine; in particular, CHKB shows parameters consistent with an enhanced role in directing the formation of phosphoethanolamine, the precursor for phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis (kent2003multipleisoformsof pages 1-2). The distinct substrate specificity is attributed to variations in the active site architecture; amino acid residues lining the substrate-binding pocket confer differential interactions with the quaternary amine groups of choline versus ethanolamine. These subtle differences in substrate recognition help to explain the physiological role of CHKB in tissue-specific lipid metabolism, particularly in muscle cells where proper phosphatidylethanolamine production is essential for mitochondrial function and membrane repair. The dual substrate specificity of CHKB and the relative kinetic differences observed among isoforms underscore its critical role in balancing phospholipid composition within the cell (OpenTargets Search: -CHKB).

5. Structure  
The three-dimensional structure of CHKB is characterized by a conserved kinase fold that is emblematic of the choline/ethanolamine kinase family. The enzyme is organized into two major domains: an N-terminal domain that primarily accommodates ATP binding and a C-terminal domain that forms the substrate-binding pocket. Crystallographic studies, particularly those focusing on human choline kinase isoforms such as CHKA, provide the structural framework that is applicable to CHKB given their approximately 60% sequence homology (malito2006elucidationofhuman pages 4-5, kent2003multipleisoformsof pages 7-9). The N-terminal portion of the protein exhibits a β-sheet rich architecture that contributes to the formation of the ATP-binding site, where conserved residues interact with the adenine ring and phosphate groups of ATP. In contrast, the C-terminal domain contains a series of α-helices and loops that compose the substrate-binding region, including characteristic structural motifs such as the Brenner’s motif and the choline kinase-specific motif. These motifs are essential for properly orienting choline or ethanolamine in the active site for phosphorylation. Structural data obtained from related choline kinases also indicate that the enzyme undergoes conformational changes upon substrate binding, particularly a closure of an ATP-binding loop that stabilizes the transition state and facilitates phosphoryl transfer (malito2006elucidationofhuman pages 2-4, torretta2020crystalstructureof pages 6-8). In addition, oligomerization appears to be a recurring feature among choline kinase isoforms, with evidence from Caenorhabditis elegans indicating that kinase activity is mediated by dimer formation; it is plausible that CHKB similarly forms homodimers or heterodimers with its CHKA counterpart, thereby modulating its catalytic function (kent2003multipleisoformsof pages 7-9). Detailed structural analyses from crystallographic studies, such as those on the related LicA from Streptococcus pneumoniae, further underscore that key catalytic residues and structural elements, including the hydrophobic pocket for substrate binding and the nucleotide-binding cleft, are conserved across the choline kinase family (wang2015structuralandenzymatic pages 4-6). These conserved features collectively provide a robust framework for understanding the mechanism of substrate phosphorylation by CHKB.

6. Regulation  
The regulation of CHKB activity is achieved through multiple mechanisms that involve both transcriptional control and post‐translational modifications. Although comprehensive mapping of these regulatory events specific to CHKB is not as extensively documented as for some other kinases, several studies have identified key regulatory features that are likely to apply. Structural analyses indicate that substrate binding induces significant conformational changes in the enzyme, including closure of the ATP-binding loop, which serves as an intrinsic regulatory mechanism to control catalytic efficiency (malito2006elucidationofhuman pages 10-11). In addition, proteomic studies have reported the presence of post‐translational modifications—such as phosphorylation—on choline/ethanolamine kinases; such modifications are thought to modulate enzymatic activity, stability, or cellular localization, although detailed mapping of specific phosphorylation sites on CHKB remains to be fully elucidated (larauckas2016cholinekinasealpha—putting pages 15-17). Tissue-specific regulation is also evident, as the expression levels of CHKB are tightly controlled in muscle and bone, tissues that are particularly sensitive to disruptions in phospholipid metabolism. This regulatory control ensures that the flux through the Kennedy pathway is responsive to the metabolic demands of cells, thereby maintaining membrane integrity and proper signaling functions. Overall, the regulation of CHKB involves a combination of conformational modulation on substrate engagement and likely post‐translational events that fine‐tune its activity in a context-dependent manner.

7. Function  
CHKB has a central role in cellular phospholipid metabolism, functioning as the gatekeeper for the Kennedy pathway that generates the essential membrane phospholipids phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. By phosphorylating choline and ethanolamine, CHKB produces the activated intermediates (phosphocholine and phosphoethanolamine) required for subsequent enzymatic reactions that culminate in the synthesis of these complex lipids (OpenTargets Search: -CHKB). In muscle tissue, where membrane integrity and mitochondrial function are critical, CHKB activity is indispensable; genetic studies have linked mutations in CHKB to congenital muscular dystrophies, including the megaconial type, which are characterized by severe muscle weakness and mitochondrial abnormalities. Furthermore, the enzyme plays a crucial role in maintaining the appropriate balance of phospholipid species, which is essential not only for membrane biogenesis but also for membrane fluidity, curvature, and the regulation of intracellular signaling pathways. CHKB is highly expressed in tissues that are subject to constant mechanical stress, such as skeletal and cardiac muscle, underscoring its importance in the repair and maintenance of cell membranes during frequent cycles of damage and renewal. In addition to its canonical metabolic functions, the dual substrate specificity of CHKB may also contribute to cellular responses during stress, with alterations in choline or ethanolamine flux potentially influencing downstream signaling cascades and cellular adaptations. The cellular consequences of CHKB deficiency, as evidenced by genetic and biochemical studies, include impaired membrane assembly, defective mitochondrial morphology, and perturbations in energy homeostasis, all of which have been observed in patients with CHKB-associated myopathies (OpenTargets Search: -CHKB).

8. Other Comments  
There are currently no selective inhibitors that have been reported to target CHKB specifically; rather, pharmacological efforts have predominantly focused on inhibiting the CHKA isoform due to its established role in oncogenesis. The essential physiological functions of CHKB in muscle and bone, along with its non-redundant role in maintaining membrane phospholipid homeostasis, render it a challenging target for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, genetic studies have identified pathogenic mutations in CHKB that lead to disorders such as megaconial congenital muscular dystrophy, and these mutations typically result in biochemical defects that compromise normal phospholipid synthesis and mitochondrial function (OpenTargets Search: -CHKB). Although a genetic variant located in the genomic region surrounding CHKB has been associated with conditions such as narcolepsy, detailed functional analyses of these mutations are still emerging. The dual substrate specificity of CHKB distinguishes it from CHKA, emphasizing its utility in fine-tuning the balance between phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis. This unique property, along with its involvement in critical cellular processes such as membrane assembly and repair, underpins the enzyme’s biological significance. The current lack of selective small-molecule inhibitors for CHKB further reflects the necessity for additional structural and biochemical studies aimed at elucidating unique binding sites or regulatory interactions that might serve as points for targeted therapeutic intervention.
