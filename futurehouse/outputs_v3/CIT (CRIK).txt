1. Phylogeny  
Citron Rho-interacting kinase (CIT), also known as CRIK, KIAA0949, or STK21 (UniProt O14578), is a serine/threonine kinase that belongs to the group of Rho effector kinases conserved across metazoan species. Orthologs of CIT are found in organisms ranging from Drosophila melanogaster – where the protein is designated as Drosophila Citron kinase (Dck) – to mammals, including mice and humans, indicating an evolutionarily ancient origin for this protein in the regulation of cell division and neural development (madaule2000citronarho pages 1-2, naim2004drosophilacitronkinaseis pages 4-6). Comparative analyses demonstrate that CIT diverged from other Rho target kinases, such as the Rho-associated kinases (ROCKs) and MRCKs, thereby constituting a distinct evolutionary branch within the serine/threonine kinome (bianchi2020ofringsand pages 1-2, ishizaki2014molecularstructurescellular pages 17-19). In mammalian systems, two major isoforms of the protein exist: the full-length CIT-K isoform, which contains a kinase domain and is expressed in proliferative cells, and the shorter CIT-N isoform that lacks the kinase domain and is predominantly expressed in post-mitotic neurons, reflecting functional specialization during evolution (ishizaki2014molecularstructurescellular pages 17-19, bianchi2020ofringsand pages 1-2).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
CIT kinase catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues on its substrate proteins. The chemical reaction it mediates can be summarized as: ATP + [protein–L-serine or L-threonine] → ADP + [protein–L-serine/threonine]-phosphate + H⁺ (cong2020citronrhointeractingserinethreonine pages 10-11, yamashiro2003citronkinasea pages 1-2). This phosphorylation reaction is critical for regulating substrates that control cytoskeletal dynamics during cytokinesis, including the di‐phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain (MLC2) at Ser-19 and Thr-18, which in turn modulates contractile properties during cell division (yamashiro2003citronkinasea pages 1-2, madaule2000citronarho pages 2-3).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The enzymatic activity of CIT kinase requires the presence of ATP as a phosphate donor and relies on divalent cations for proper catalytic function. In particular, the kinase activity is dependent on Mg²⁺ ions, which facilitate the binding of ATP within the active site of the kinase domain (yamashiro2003citronkinasea pages 1-2, cong2020citronrhointeractingserinethreonine pages 10-11). This cofactor requirement is consistent with the biochemical characteristics observed in other serine/threonine protein kinases.

4. Substrate Specificity  
CIT kinase has been shown to exhibit substrate specificity for proteins that are integral to the processes of cytokinesis and cytoskeletal regulation. One of the best‐characterized substrates is the myosin regulatory light chain (MLC2), which undergoes di‐phosphorylation at Ser‐19 and Thr‐18 upon modification by CIT kinase; this modification is essential for the appropriate regulation of the actomyosin contractile apparatus during cytokinesis (yamashiro2003citronkinasea pages 1-2, madaule2000citronarho pages 2-3). In addition to MLC2, CIT kinase phosphorylates INCENP, a component of the chromosomal passenger complex, to promote the activation of Aurora B kinase and facilitate correct midbody assembly (mckenzie2016crossregulationbetweenaurora pages 10-11). Other substrates identified in cancer-related contexts include RNA-binding proteins such as MATR3 and THRAP3, suggesting that CIT kinase may also influence processes beyond actomyosin regulation, including alternative splicing and gene expression (rawat2023prostatecancerprogression pages 34-40, rawat2023prostatecancerprogression pages 40-40).

5. Structure  
CIT kinase is a large protein of approximately 230 kDa and is composed of multiple, well‐defined structural domains that coordinate its diverse functions. The N-terminal segment contains a serine/threonine kinase domain that is responsible for the catalytic activity of phosphorylating substrate proteins (bianchi2020ofringsand pages 1-2, ishizaki2014molecularstructurescellular pages 17-19). This is followed by an extended central region characterized by long coiled-coil motifs that facilitate homo‐oligomerization and mediate critical protein–protein interactions, including the recruitment of proteins required for cytokinesis such as KIF14 (gruneberg2006kif14andcitron pages 6-7, madaule2000citronarho pages 1-2). Downstream of the coiled-coil region, CIT kinase features a set of domains including a zinc finger—often described as a phorbol ester/DAG-type zinc finger—and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that likely contribute to lipid binding and membrane association (bianchi2020ofringsand pages 1-2, madaule2000citronarho pages 1-2). Towards the C-terminus, the protein harbors a Citron-Nik1 homology (CNH) domain as well as putative SH3 and PDZ binding motifs, which are implicated in mediating interactions with cytoskeletal and signaling proteins critical for cytokinesis and neuronal differentiation (bianchi2020ofringsand pages 1-2, ishizaki2014molecularstructurescellular pages 26-29). Notably, alternative splicing results in the production of two major isoforms: CIT-K, which retains the kinase domain and is predominantly expressed in dividing cells, and CIT-N, which lacks the kinase domain and is highly expressed in the central nervous system, where it plays roles in dendritic spine organization and synaptic function (ishizaki2014molecularstructurescellular pages 17-19, bianchi2020ofringsand pages 3-5). Recent structural models, including those inferred from AlphaFold predictions, corroborate this modular organization and provide insights into how the coiled-coil region serves as a scaffold for interactions with key cytokinetic regulators (pearce2010thenutsand pages 1-2, mckenzie2016crossregulationbetweenaurora pages 9-10).

6. Regulation  
The regulation of CIT kinase occurs at multiple levels, involving both direct interactions with regulatory proteins and post-translational modifications that affect its catalytic activity and subcellular localization. Binding of CIT kinase to the active, GTP-bound forms of Rho and Rac is essential for its activation and proper targeting to the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis; this interaction occurs through dedicated Rho-binding domains within the protein (madaule2000citronarho pages 1-2, bianchi2020ofringsand pages 7-8). A central regulatory mechanism involves cross-talk with Aurora B kinase: CIT kinase phosphorylates the INCENP subunit of the chromosomal passenger complex, which is necessary for the activation of Aurora B, and reciprocally, Aurora B phosphorylates CIT kinase to modulate its interactions and localization at the midbody (mckenzie2016crossregulationbetweenaurora pages 10-11, mckenzie2016crossregulationbetweenaurora pages 13-14). In addition, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 has been demonstrated to interact with CIT kinase and regulate its activation during the late stages of cell division; disruption of this interaction leads to cytokinesis defects and abnormal cell cycle progression (serres2012p27kip1controlscytokinesis pages 8-12). In proliferative and cancer contexts, transcriptional regulation of CIT is integrated within an E2F-Skp2-p27 signaling axis, which contributes to increased CIT expression in aggressive tumor types such as prostate cancer (rawat2023prostatecancerprogression pages 34-40). These layers of regulation, encompassing direct protein interactions, phosphorylation events, and transcriptional control, collectively ensure that CIT kinase activity is tightly synchronized with mitotic progression and cytokinesis (bianchi2020ofringsand pages 3-5, sahin2019citronrhointeractingkinase pages 6-8).

7. Function  
CIT kinase plays an indispensable role in cytokinesis, the final process of cell division, by orchestrating the formation and stabilization of the contractile ring and the midbody structure that facilitates daughter cell separation. Through the phosphorylation of MLC2 at critical residues (Ser-19 and Thr-18), CIT kinase modulates the actomyosin network to ensure proper contractile force generation during the abscission phase of cytokinesis (yamashiro2003citronkinasea pages 1-2, madaule2000citronarho pages 2-3). It also contributes to the localization of key mitotic proteins, such as KIF14, to the central spindle and midbody, a process essential for maintaining midbody integrity and successful cell division (gruneberg2006kif14andcitron pages 6-7, mckenzie2016crossregulationbetweenaurora pages 2-3). Beyond its role in cytokinesis, CIT kinase is critical for neural development; its expression in neural progenitor cells is required for proper brain growth, and loss-of-function mutations in the CIT gene are linked to autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH17), a condition characterized by reduced brain size and neurogenesis defects (bianchi2020ofringsand pages 3-5, li2016biallelicmutationsin pages 1-2, pallavicini2024modelingprimarymicrocephaly pages 14-15). CIT kinase has also been implicated in the maintenance of genomic stability by contributing to the proper repair of DNA double-strand breaks via networks that involve RAD51 and BRCA1; such functions are particularly important in rapidly dividing neural progenitors (iegiani2025citkmodulatesbrca1 pages 1-2, girgenti2015epigeneticregulationof pages 101-106). In oncogenic settings, CIT kinase is frequently overexpressed in cancers such as medulloblastoma, prostate cancer, and multiple myeloma, where its kinase activity supports tumor cell proliferation by ensuring efficient cytokinesis and by influencing alternative RNA splicing events (rawat2023prostatecancerprogression pages 15-16, rawat2023prostatecancerprogression pages 16-18, sahin2019citronrhointeractingkinase pages 8-8, pallavicini2018inactivationofcitron pages 22-27). Furthermore, the neural-specific CIT-N isoform contributes to synaptic organization through its role in dendritic spine maturation and maintenance, although it lacks catalytic activity and likely functions as a scaffolding protein (ishizaki2014molecularstructurescellular pages 17-19, zhang2006targetingandclustering pages 2-4).

8. Other Comments  
CIT kinase has attracted considerable attention as a potential therapeutic target due to its central role in cytokinesis and its association with various disease states. Inhibitors such as OTS-167 and the staurosporine derivative Lestaurtinib have been shown to inhibit CIT kinase activity, leading to cytokinesis failure, accumulation of DNA damage, and subsequent cell death in cancer models including prostate cancer and medulloblastoma (rawat2023prostatecancerprogression pages 15-16, pallavicini2023lestaurtinibinhibitscitron pages 1-2). Mutations in the CIT gene that result in loss of kinase function are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders such as primary microcephaly, underscoring the protein’s importance in neural progenitor cell division and brain development (li2016biallelicmutationsin pages 1-2, pallavicini2024modelingprimarymicrocephaly pages 14-15). In addition, aberrant overexpression of CIT has been observed in several malignancies, including multiple myeloma, prostate cancer, and medulloblastoma, where it is believed to contribute to unchecked cell proliferation and genomic instability (pallavicini2018inactivationofcitron pages 22-27, rawat2023prostatecancerprogression pages 34-40, sahin2019citronrhointeractingkinase pages 6-8). CIT kinase also participates in epigenetic regulatory mechanisms within neural progenitors through its interaction with the histone methyltransferase G9a, which modulates H3K9 dimethylation and gene repression (girgenti2015epigeneticregulationof pages 101-106, girgenti2015epigeneticregulationof pages 36-41). Furthermore, the dual isoform nature of CIT—with CIT-K acting as an active kinase in dividing cells and CIT-N as a non-catalytic modulator in differentiated neurons—illustrates its multifaceted role in both cell cycle progression and neuronal function (ishizaki2014molecularstructurescellular pages 17-19, bianchi2020ofringsand pages 3-5). These diverse functions, coupled with its well-documented regulatory interactions, highlight the potential of CIT kinase as a drug target in both neurodevelopmental disorders and various cancers.
