1. Phylogeny  
Serine/threonine‐protein kinase DCLK1, also known by its gene aliases DCAMKL1, DCDC3A and KIAA0369, is positioned within the serine/threonine kinase superfamily and exhibits a modular organization that combines N‐terminal doublecortin (DCX) domains with a C‐terminal catalytic kinase module (burgess2001cleavageofdoublecortinlike pages 4-5). The DCX domains are evolutionarily conserved across vertebrates and are characteristic of the doublecortin protein family, which plays crucial roles in microtubule stabilization, neuronal migration and axonal elongation during brain development (burgess2002alternativesplicevariants pages 1-2). Comparative sequence analyses have revealed that the catalytic domain of DCLK1 shares approximately 45% sequence identity with related CaMKI and CaMKIV family kinases, positioning it as an intermediate member of the CaMK clade (burgess2002alternativesplicevariants pages 5-7, ohmae2006molecularidentificationand pages 4-5). In addition, the presence of multiple isoforms generated through alternative splicing reflects an evolutionary strategy to regulate both cytoskeletal interactions and phosphotransferase activity in a tissue‐ and developmental stage‐specific manner (burgess2002alternativesplicevariants pages 7-9). Phylogenetic studies based on sequence analysis and domain architecture have established that DCLK1 orthologs are broadly distributed among mammalian species and that its unique domain combination is conserved in proteins involved in microtubule regulation for neuronal migration (reiner2006theevolvingdoublecortin pages 11-12, venkat2023mechanisticandevolutionary pages 1-2).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
DCLK1 functions as a serine/threonine kinase that catalyzes the transfer of the γ‐phosphate from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins (patel2016biochemicalandstructural pages 1-3). In chemical terms, its enzymatic activity can be summarized by the reaction:  
  ATP + [protein] – (L‐serine or L‐threonine) → ADP + [protein] – (L‐serine/threonine)‐phosphate + H⁺ (venkat2023mechanisticandevolutionary pages 2-4).  
The catalytic mechanism involves the proper positioning of ATP by conserved motifs within the kinase domain – including the HRD loop and the DFG motif – so that the substrate’s hydroxyl group may perform a nucleophilic attack on the γ‐phosphate, thereby yielding the phosphorylated product (patel2016biochemicalandstructural pages 3-4).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The kinase activity of DCLK1 is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions, with Mg²⁺ being the primary cofactor required for efficient catalysis (patel2016biochemicalandstructural pages 1-3). Magnesium ions coordinate with the phosphate moieties of ATP within the active site, stabilizing both the substrate and the transition state during the phosphotransfer reaction (patel2016biochemicalandstructural pages 1-3). This cofactor requirement is in agreement with the commonly observed dependency among serine/threonine kinases, particularly those within the CaMKI‐related family (patel2016biochemicalandstructural pages 1-3).

4. Substrate Specificity  
DCLK1 exhibits specificity for target serine and threonine residues embedded in particular amino acid sequence environments. Although an unequivocal consensus sequence for DCLK1 substrates has not been fully delineated, available studies indicate a preference for substrates that contain clusters of basic residues – particularly arginine – in positions immediately upstream of the phosphorylatable residue (burgess2002alternativesplicevariants pages 7-9). Experimental peptide assays have demonstrated that arginine residues at the −3 and −2 positions relative to the target serine or threonine markedly enhance phosphorylation efficiency (ramkumar2018remappingthemicrotubule pages 17-19). In this context, the electrostatic interaction between positively charged arginine residues and the negatively charged catalytic pocket appears to contribute to optimal substrate positioning, yielding a substrate recognition motif that aligns with general features observed in the CaMKI/CaMKIV group (burgess2002alternativesplicevariants pages 7-9, ramkumar2018remappingthemicrotubule pages 17-19).

5. Structure  
DCLK1 is characterized by a modular structure that integrates functionally distinct domains. The N‐terminal region comprises one or more tandem doublecortin (DCX) domains; these domains typically adopt a β‐barrel or β‐grasp fold that efficiently binds tubulin dimers to promote microtubule polymerization and stabilization—a function critical for neuronal migration (burgess2001cleavageofdoublecortinlike pages 4-5, reiner2006theevolvingdoublecortin pages 4-7). Centrally, DCLK1 contains a well‐conserved serine/threonine kinase domain that is structurally divided into an N‐lobe and a C‐lobe. The N‐lobe includes the glycine‐rich loop (G‐loop) that interacts with ATP, while the C‐lobe harbors the substrate‐binding region and catalytic motifs such as the HRD and DFG motifs, which are crucial for phosphotransferase activity (patel2016biochemicalandstructural pages 1-3, shang2003catalyticandregulatory pages 1-2). Additionally, DCLK1 possesses an intrinsically disordered C‐terminal tail that serves a regulatory function; structural models and experimental data suggest that this tail can dock against the kinase domain, thereby contributing to the stabilization of the hydrophobic catalytic spine (C‐spine) and, in its docked state, occluding the ATP‐binding site to act as an autoinhibitory mechanism (venkat2023mechanisticandevolutionary pages 12-14, rogers2020autoregulatorycontrolof pages 3-5, shang2003catalyticandregulatory pages 6-7). This dual‐domain organization, coupling microtubule binding through the DCX domains with catalytic activity in the kinase domain, underlies the multifunctional nature of DCLK1 (carli2023structureguidedpredictionof pages 2-4, carli2023structureguidedpredictionof pages 8-9).

6. Regulation  
The regulatory mechanisms governing DCLK1 activity involve multiple layers of control that include intramolecular autophosphorylation, alternative splicing, and conformational dynamics. A principal mechanism is intramolecular autophosphorylation, wherein the kinase domain phosphorylates specific serine/threonine residues on DCLK1 itself. Autophosphorylation events, particularly within the C‐terminal tail, have been mapped using techniques such as Phos‐tag gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. These modifications can induce conformational changes that result in the docking of the C‐terminal tail against the catalytic core, effectively occluding the ATP‐binding site and functioning as an autoinhibitory signal (rogers2020autoregulatorycontrolof pages 1-3, rogers2020autoregulatorycontrolof pages 21-22, rogers2020autoregulatorycontrolof pages 22-29). Furthermore, increased phosphorylation within the DCX domains is associated with decreased microtubule binding, thereby modulating DCLK1’s interaction with the cytoskeleton (rogers2020autoregulatorycontrolof pages 3-5, rogers2020autoregulatorycontrolof pages 5-7).  
Alternative splicing of the DCLK1 gene generates isoforms with differences in the number and arrangement of DCX domains, as well as variations in the length and composition of the regulatory C‐terminal region. These isoform‐specific variations have been shown to affect both the intrinsic kinase activity and the extent of C‐tail mediated autoinhibition, with kinetic analyses revealing changes in ATP affinity and catalytic turnover between isoforms (burgess2002alternativesplicevariants pages 1-2, rogers2021autoregulatorycontrolof pages 1-2, rogers2021autoregulatorycontrolof pages 11-12, rogers2021autoregulatorycontrolof pages 15-17, rogers2021autoregulatorycontrolof pages 2-4, rogers2021autoregulatorycontrolof pages 5-6, rogers2021autoregulatorycontrolof pages 9-11). These regulatory pathways ensure that DCLK1 activity is tightly controlled according to cellular context and developmental stage, balancing the requirements for microtubule stabilization with the need for dynamic phosphosignaling.

7. Function  
DCLK1 exerts dual functionalities that integrate its role as a microtubule‐associated protein with its serine/threonine kinase activity. During neuronal development, the DCX domains of DCLK1 bind to microtubules to facilitate their polymerization and stabilization, processes that are essential for neuronal migration, axon guidance, and the proper positioning of neurons during brain development (burgess2001cleavageofdoublecortinlike pages 4-5, ohmae2006molecularidentificationand pages 4-5, reiner2006theevolvingdoublecortin pages 11-12). Concurrently, the kinase activity of DCLK1 is capable of phosphorylating substrates that may further influence cytoskeletal dynamics, thereby modulating processes such as neurite outgrowth and dendritic patterning (burgess2002alternativesplicevariants pages 7-9, ramkumar2018remappingthemicrotubule pages 17-19).  
In mature neurons, DCLK1 contributes to the maintenance of neuronal polarity and dendritic architecture through its impact on microtubule stability and associated signaling pathways. The integration of its microtubule‐binding function with autophosphorylation‐mediated regulation of kinase activity enables DCLK1 to participate in the remodeling of dendritic spines and the regulation of synaptic plasticity. This dual activity is critical for maintaining the structural integrity and functional modulation of neuronal circuits (chhetri2022pleiotropiceffectsof pages 2-3).  
Beyond its roles in the nervous system, alterations in DCLK1 expression and splicing have been observed in various cancers. Overexpression and aberrant splicing of DCLK1 isoforms have been associated with enhanced migratory and invasive characteristics in tumor cells, implicating DCLK1 in oncogenic processes that involve both cytoskeletal reorganization and altered phosphorylation signaling networks (burgess2002alternativesplicevariants pages 7-9). These observations position DCLK1 as a protein that bridges fundamental aspects of neurodevelopment with mechanisms that may contribute to tumorigenesis.

8. Other Comments  
DCLK1’s distinctive combination of tandem DCX domains and a serine/threonine kinase domain renders it clinically significant, particularly in the context of cancer biology. Aberrant expression and alternative splicing patterns of DCLK1 have been correlated with aggressive tumor phenotypes and enhanced cancer stem cell properties in several cancer types such as colorectal, pancreatic and gastric cancers (chhetri2022pleiotropiceffectsof pages 2-3). The absence of a canonical calmodulin‐binding domain in DCLK1 distinguishes its regulation from other CaMKI‐like kinases, placing a greater emphasis on autophosphorylation and C‐terminal tail docking as mechanisms for controlling activity (rogers2020autoregulatorycontrolof pages 1-3, rogers2021autoregulatorycontrolof pages 1-2).  
This autoinhibitory regulation mediated by the C‐terminal tail forms the basis for ongoing research into novel therapeutic strategies, including the design of small‐molecule inhibitors that target the conserved ATP‐binding site or disrupt the autoinhibitory docking interactions. Furthermore, differential splicing and isoform expression of DCLK1 continue to be examined as potential biomarkers for disease progression and therapeutic response, underscoring the need for isoform‐selective inhibitors in a clinical context (venkat2023mechanisticandevolutionary pages 17-18, venkat2023mechanisticandevolutionary pages 18-19, rogers2021autoregulatorycontrolof pages 9-11).
