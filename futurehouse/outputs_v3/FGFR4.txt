1. Phylogeny  
FGFR4 is a member of the fibroblast growth factor receptor family, which belongs to the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) superfamily that is conserved across metazoans and has been shaped by early whole genome duplication events in vertebrates (brunet2016wholegenomeduplications pages 3-4). Orthologs of FGFR4 have been identified throughout jawed vertebrates, and phylogenetic analyses consistently cluster FGFR4 together with FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 into a well‐defined FGFR subfamily (brunet2016wholegenomeduplications pages 4-5, liu2017identificationandcharacterization pages 5-7). The evolutionary trajectory of FGFR4 reflects its divergence from other RTKs through the retention of a conserved catalytic domain while developing unique features, such as a lack of alternative splicing in the IgIII domain, which distinguishes it from its paralogs (gong2014isoformsofreceptors pages 4-5, ho2014currentstrategiesfor pages 1-2). This placement within the RTK kinome is consistent with analyses showing that the FGFR subfamily emerged through successive duplication events, and it continues to be maintained as a core set of regulators in vertebrate signaling (brunet2016wholegenomeduplications pages 6-7, liu2017identificationandcharacterization pages 2-4).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
FGFR4 catalyzes the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on target proteins through an ATP-dependent reaction. The reaction can be summarized as follows: ATP + [protein]-tyrosine → ADP + [protein]-phosphotyrosine + H⁺ (katoh2014fgfreceptorscancer pages 1-3, roskoski2020theroleof pages 15-19). This canonical tyrosine phosphorylation event is central to initiating signal transduction cascades; the kinase not only autophosphorylates but also phosphorylates downstream substrates, thereby transmitting extracellular signals into cellular responses (dai2019fibroblastgrowthfactor pages 1-4, ferguson2021fibroblastgrowthfactor pages 2-3).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The catalytic activity of FGFR4 depends on the presence of divalent cations, with Mg²⁺ being required to coordinate ATP binding and stabilize the transition state during the phosphotransfer reaction. This cofactor requirement is analogous to that observed with other protein kinases, where Mg²⁺ is essential for effective catalysis (roskoski2020theroleof pages 15-19).

4. Substrate Specificity  
FGFR4 exhibits substrate specificity for tyrosine residues, both in its own cytoplasmic domain during autophosphorylation and on key downstream signaling proteins. Although a detailed consensus substrate motif for FGFR4 has not been explicitly defined in the available literature, its known substrates include PLCG1 (phospholipase C gamma 1) and FRS2 (fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2), which contain tyrosine residues critical for docking and subsequent signal propagation (dai2019fibroblastgrowthfactor pages 1-4, ferguson2021fibroblastgrowthfactor pages 2-3). As a tyrosine-specific kinase, FGFR4 is expected to recognize substrates based on the spatial configuration of its catalytic domain, ensuring that only proteins with appropriately exposed and compatible tyrosine residues are phosphorylated (dai2019fibroblastgrowthfactor pages 4-5).

5. Structure  
FGFR4 is a type I transmembrane receptor protein characterized by a modular architecture. The extracellular region comprises three immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains designated D1, D2, and D3; the D2–D3 region is primarily responsible for ligand binding, while the D1 domain, in conjunction with an acidic “acid box” located between D1 and D2, contributes to autoinhibition in the absence of ligand (dai2019fibroblastgrowthfactor pages 1-4, gong2014isoformsofreceptors pages 4-5, ho2014currentstrategiesfor pages 1-2). Unlike FGFR1–3, FGFR4 lacks alternative splicing in its IgIII domain, resulting in a fixed ligand-binding profile that restricts its interaction to a narrow spectrum of fibroblast growth factors.  

The receptor contains a single transmembrane helix that anchors it within the plasma membrane and an intracellular region that harbors the tyrosine kinase domain. The kinase domain follows a canonical bilobed structure: the smaller N-terminal lobe is composed primarily of β-sheets with an essential αC-helix, and the larger C-terminal lobe is predominantly α-helical (dai2019fibroblastgrowthfactor pages 1-4, dai2019fibroblastgrowthfactor pages 4-5). Within this catalytic core, conserved motifs such as the DFG (Asp–Phe–Gly) motif in the activation loop and the HRD motif in the catalytic loop are critical for coordinating ATP binding and catalysis; these elements also contribute to the formation of hydrophobic spines that stabilize the active conformation (dai2019fibroblastgrowthfactor pages 10-12, roskoski2020theroleof pages 15-19). Structural studies, including crystallographic analyses of related FGFR kinase domains, indicate that conformational changes in the activation loop and the positioning of the C-helix are pivotal in shifting between the active “DFG-in” and inactive “DFG-out” states, which in turn govern kinase activity (roskoski2020theroleof pages 56-73). The distinct divergence in the kinase domain of FGFR4 relative to FGFR1 (and its other paralogs) also underlies differences in inhibitor sensitivity and catalytic efficiency (roskoski2020theroleof pages 56-73).

6. Regulation  
Activation of FGFR4 is initiated by the binding of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) to its extracellular domain, which, together with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (or Klotho coreceptors, in the case of endocrine FGFs), promotes receptor dimerization. This dimerization facilitates trans-autophosphorylation of key tyrosine residues within the intracellular kinase domain, a critical event that creates docking sites for downstream adaptor proteins such as FRS2 and PLCG1 (dai2019fibroblastgrowthfactor pages 1-4, ferguson2021fibroblastgrowthfactor pages 2-3).  

Following ligand-induced activation, FGFR4 undergoes a series of phosphorylation events within the activation loop and other regulatory regions. These phosphorylation events are essential for full kinase activation and for the recruitment of multiple signaling effectors that propagate intracellular signaling pathways (dai2019fibroblastgrowthfactor pages 4-5, roskoski2020theroleof pages 7-11). In addition, post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination play a role in regulating FGFR4 levels at the plasma membrane. Although ubiquitination typically directs RTKs to lysosomal degradation, FGFR4 has been reported to be preferentially sorted into recycling compartments, thereby sustaining signaling over longer periods relative to other FGFR family members (ferguson2021fibroblastgrowthfactor pages 5-7, margiotta2021allgoodthings pages 2-4). Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are also involved in dephosphorylating FGFR4, serving as a counterbalance to kinase activity and thus modulating the amplitude and duration of its signaling output (dai2019fibroblastgrowthfactor pages 1-4).

7. Function  
FGFR4 functions as a cell-surface receptor for fibroblast growth factors and plays a central role in the regulation of diverse cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, and migration. Upon ligand engagement, the receptor’s kinase activity is activated to initiate signaling cascades such as the RAS/MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways, which are critical for transmitting signals that control cell growth and survival (dai2019fibroblastgrowthfactor pages 1-4, ferguson2021fibroblastgrowthfactor pages 2-3).  

In addition to its roles in cell proliferation and differentiation, FGFR4 is implicated in metabolic regulation. It is involved in the control of lipid metabolism, glucose uptake, and vitamin D metabolism, as well as in the homeostasis of phosphate levels. Notably, FGFR4 is required for the normal down-regulation of CYP7A1, the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis, in response to FGF19 stimulation. This function underscores its importance in maintaining bile acid biosynthesis and overall metabolic balance (dai2019fibroblastgrowthfactor pages 1-4, liu2023fgfrfamiliesbiological pages 9-11).  

FGFR4 also phosphorylates key substrates such as PLCG1 and FRS2. Phosphorylation of PLCG1 leads to the production of secondary messengers—diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)—which are instrumental in propagating intracellular signals. Meanwhile, phosphorylation of FRS2 results in the recruitment of adaptor proteins, including GRB2, GAB1, PIK3R1, and SOS1, thereby activating downstream cascades that contribute to cell growth and survival (dai2019fibroblastgrowthfactor pages 1-4, ferguson2021fibroblastgrowthfactor pages 2-3). Moreover, FGFR4 signaling has been linked to SRC-dependent phosphorylation of matrix protease MMP14, a modification that targets MMP14 for lysosomal degradation and modulates extracellular matrix remodeling (information provided).  

The tissue-specific expression of FGFR4, with prominent roles in the liver and other tissues engaged in metabolic regulation, further emphasizes its multifaceted role in both normal physiology and in disease contexts such as cancer, where aberrant FGFR4 activity has been associated with tumor progression and metastasis (katoh2014fgfreceptorscancer pages 1-3, roskoski2020theroleof pages 15-19).

8. Other Comments  
Several small molecule inhibitors have been developed that target FGFR4, exploiting unique features within its kinase domain to achieve selectivity over other FGFR family members. These inhibitors are under clinical investigation for their potential to modulate aberrant FGFR4 signaling in various cancers, particularly those of the liver, where FGFR4 overexpression is linked to poor prognosis (roskoski2020theroleof pages 56-73, katoh2014fgfreceptorscancer pages 1-3). Although activating mutations in FGFR4 are relatively infrequent, its overexpression and dysregulated signaling are recognized as contributors to oncogenic processes. In addition, FGFR4’s distinct regulation—where it is preferentially recycled to the plasma membrane rather than being targeted for rapid lysosomal degradation—may offer unique opportunities for therapeutic intervention (ferguson2021fibroblastgrowthfactor pages 5-7, margiotta2021allgoodthings pages 2-4).  

Current research efforts also focus on modulating FGFR4-mediated signaling to correct metabolic dysfunctions, given its critical role in bile acid synthesis and energy homeostasis. The development of inhibitors that selectively target FGFR4 not only holds promise for cancer therapy but may also have implications for metabolic disorders associated with aberrant FGFR4 activity (liu2023fgfrfamiliesbiological pages 9-11, katoh2014fgfreceptorscancer pages 1-3).
