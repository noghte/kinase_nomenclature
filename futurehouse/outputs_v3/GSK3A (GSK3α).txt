1. Phylogeny  
Glycogen synthase kinase‐3 alpha (GSK3A) is an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine protein kinase that emerges as a member of the GSK‐3 family within the CMGC group of kinases. In mammals, two paralogous isoforms exist—GSK3A and GSK3B—with GSK3A being the longer isoform (approximately 51 kDa) owing to an additional glycine‐rich N‐terminal extension absent in GSK3B, which has a molecular weight of about 47 kDa (ali2001glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-2, pandey2016glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-2). Orthologs of GSK3A have been identified not only in vertebrates but also in a wide range of eukaryotic organisms including invertebrates, plants, and fungi, underscoring a deep evolutionary origin that can be traced back to early eukaryotic ancestors. This kinase is part of an evolutionarily old signaling machinery that is interconnected with other key regulatory proteins such as protein kinase B (AKT) and members of the Wnt pathway, thereby forming a core set of conserved proteins that are essential for cell metabolism, proliferation, and differentiation (ali2001glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-2, nagini2019glycogensynthasekinases pages 1-2). Moreover, gene duplication events early in metazoan evolution gave rise to the two GSK‐3 isoforms that now function in both overlapping and distinct cellular contexts. The conservation of the catalytic domain—with nearly 98% sequence identity between GSK3A and GSK3B—reflects not only the essential nature of their kinase activity but also implies that the divergence in their noncatalytic regions contributes to their isoform‐specific functions and subcellular localizations (ali2001glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-2, nagini2019glycogensynthasekinases pages 2-3).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
GSK3A functions as a serine/threonine kinase that catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to specific serine or threonine residues within target substrates. This enzymatic reaction can be summarized as follows:  
  ATP + [protein]–(L‐serine or L‐threonine) → ADP + [protein]–(L‐serine/threonine)‐phosphate + H⁺  
The reaction is characteristic of many protein kinases, in which the phosphorylation event results in a conformational and functional modulation of the substrate protein (ali2001glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-2).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The catalytic activity of GSK3A is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions, with magnesium ions (Mg²⁺) serving as an essential cofactor. Mg²⁺ ions facilitate the proper orientation of ATP within the enzyme’s active site and are crucial for the phosphoryl transfer reaction to occur efficiently. This requirement for Mg²⁺ is typical for serine/threonine kinases and is supported by experimental studies demonstrating that GSK3A activity is significantly reduced in the absence of this cofactor (macaulay2008targetingglycogensynthase pages 3-4, wang2022glycogensynthesisand pages 11-12).

4. Substrate Specificity  
GSK3A exhibits a strict substrate specificity that is predicated on a unique “priming” mechanism. For efficient phosphorylation, most substrates must first be phosphorylated by a priming kinase at a serine or threonine residue located four amino acids C‐terminal to the target residue. This creates a “primed” substrate that is recognized by a specific phosphate‐binding pocket in GSK3A, thereby greatly enhancing the affinity and catalytic efficiency of phosphorylation. The consensus recognition motif for GSK3A is typically represented as S/T–X–X–X–S/T(P), where the S/T(P) denotes a phosphorylated serine or threonine residue (ali2001glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-2, beurel2015glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 2-4). Well‐characterized substrates of GSK3A include glycogen synthase (GYS1 and GYS2), in which phosphorylation inhibits its activity, and key components of the Wnt signaling pathway such as CTNNB1/beta‐catenin, APC, and AXIN1. The requirement for primed substrates ensures that GSK3A activity is tightly controlled within the broader network of kinase cascades and signaling pathways (ali2001glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 2-3, nagini2019glycogensynthasekinases pages 2-3).

5. Structure  
GSK3A is composed predominantly of a highly conserved kinase domain that is shared almost identically with GSK3B; however, GSK3A is distinguished by an N‐terminal extension enriched in glycine residues, which contributes to its larger molecular weight (approximately 51 kDa) compared to GSK3B (around 47 kDa) (pandey2016glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-2, nagini2019glycogensynthasekinases pages 2-3). The central kinase domain comprises a typical bilobal structure consisting of an N‐terminal lobe rich in β‐strands and a larger C‐terminal lobe predominantly composed of α‐helices. Key structural features within the kinase domain include an ATP‐binding pocket, a glycine-rich loop (P-loop) that is involved in the proper positioning of ATP, and a catalytic loop where residues critical for phosphoryl transfer—such as a conserved lysine (analogous to K205 in GSK3B) and several arginine residues (e.g., Arg96, Arg180)—are located (dajani2001crystalstructureof pages 2-3, eldarfinkelman2002glycogensynthasekinase pages 5-6). An activation loop within the catalytic domain is further modulated by regulatory phosphorylation events; in the case of GSK3A, inhibitory phosphorylation at its N-terminal serine residue (Ser21) plays a crucial role in modulating substrate access (jope2007glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-2, beurel2015glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 6-7). Although no high-resolution crystal structure for GSK3A has been reported independently, the high degree of conservation with GSK3B permits a reliable inference of its three-dimensional architecture based on well-characterized crystal structures of GSK3B. Unique to GSK3A is the extended N-terminal region, which may influence subcellular localization and protein–protein interactions, thereby conferring isoform‐specific regulatory properties (pandey2016glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-2, nagini2019glycogensynthasekinases pages 2-3).

6. Regulation  
GSK3A is unusual among protein kinases in that it is constitutively active under resting conditions and is primarily regulated by inhibitory mechanisms rather than activation. A critical mode of regulation is the phosphorylation of an N-terminal serine residue (Ser21 in GSK3A), which acts as an autoinhibitory modification. When phosphorylated, the N-terminal segment serves as a pseudosubstrate by occupying the primed substrate-binding pocket, thereby reducing access of genuine substrates and lowering kinase activity (jope2007glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-2, beurel2015glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 23-25). In contrast, optimal catalytic activity also requires phosphorylation at a tyrosine residue (analogous to Tyr279 in GSK3A, paralleling Tyr216 in GSK3B), which facilitates substrate binding and efficient phosphotransfer (jope2007glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-2, pandey2016glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-2). In addition to these direct modifications, GSK3A activity is modulated by upstream signaling pathways. For instance, activation of the insulin receptor leads to the stimulation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and subsequent activation of Akt, which phosphorylates GSK3A at Ser21 to inhibit its activity. This inhibition is a key step in the insulin-mediated activation of glycogen synthesis (ali2001glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-2, macaulay2008targetingglycogensynthase pages 3-4). Furthermore, within the context of Wnt signaling, GSK3A is recruited into multiprotein complexes that include Axin and APC, where its activity toward substrates such as beta-catenin is modulated in a manner that is less sensitive to the inhibitory serine phosphorylation (ali2001glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 11-12, beurel2015glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 2-4). The interplay between these regulatory mechanisms—phosphorylation by kinases such as Akt, substrate priming requirements, and sequestration within specific protein complexes—ensures that GSK3A activity is finely tuned to meet cellular demands across diverse signaling conditions (jope2007glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-2, macaulay2008targetingglycogensynthase pages 3-4).

7. Function  
GSK3A serves as a multifunctional regulator that impacts several critical cellular processes. One of its principal functions is the negative regulation of glycogen synthesis. GSK3A achieves this by phosphorylating glycogen synthase (GYS1 or GYS2), which results in the inactivation of the enzyme and a subsequent reduction in glycogen formation. This regulatory mechanism is central to the hormonal control of glucose homeostasis, particularly within hepatic tissues, where GSK3A is a key mediator of insulin’s actions. Although both isoforms are expressed in the liver, GSK3A appears to play a predominant role in regulating hepatic glycogen metabolism, whereas its role in muscle tissue glycogen synthesis is less pronounced (ali2001glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-2, macaulay2008targetingglycogensynthase pages 3-4).  
In addition to its metabolic functions, GSK3A is a critical component of the Wnt signaling pathway. In this context, it phosphorylates beta-catenin (CTNNB1), marking it for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. This activity serves to suppress the transcriptional activity of beta-catenin and is pivotal for the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation during development (ali2001glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 11-12, tejedamunoz2015glycogensynthasekinase pages 1-2). Through these actions, GSK3A exerts control over pathways that influence embryonic patterning and oncogenic transformation, thus linking its dysregulation to both developmental abnormalities and cancer.  
GSK3A also plays important roles in the regulation of transcription factors and components of the cytoskeleton, such as microtubule-associated proteins. By phosphorylating various transcriptional regulators, GSK3A can modulate gene expression programs that impact diverse cellular phenotypes, including cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and stress responses. Moreover, its activity in regulating microtubule dynamics contributes to the maintenance of cellular architecture and intracellular transport processes. Collectively, these functions underscore the versatility of GSK3A as a regulatory node that integrates metabolic cues with signal transduction pathways (ali2001glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-2, beurel2015glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 15-17).  
Beyond its canonical roles in metabolism and signaling, GSK3A has been implicated in the development of insulin resistance. By influencing the activity of transcription factors, GSK3A may contribute to the deregulation of genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism, thereby promoting a metabolic state that is characteristic of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The ability of GSK3A to interface with both insulin and Wnt signaling cascades places it at a strategic juncture where alterations in its activity can have far-reaching consequences for cellular and systemic energy homeostasis (ali2001glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-2, macaulay2008targetingglycogensynthase pages 3-4).

8. Other Comments  
Several small-molecule inhibitors have been investigated for their ability to modulate GSK3A activity, with lithium emerging as one of the most well-known and clinically used GSK3 inhibitors. While lithium is effective at reducing GSK3A activity, it is non-selective and also inhibits GSK3B, prompting ongoing efforts to develop inhibitors that preferentially target the alpha isoform without affecting isoform-specific functions. Additional inhibitors, including ATP-competitive compounds and non-ATP competitive agents, have been developed with the goal of attaining greater specificity and improved therapeutic indices. Studies exploring inhibitors such as AR-A014418 and tideglusib have provided proof-of-concept that selective modulation of GSK3 activity can yield beneficial outcomes in models of neurodegenerative disease and cancer (jope2007glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-2, macaulay2008targetingglycogensynthase pages 3-4, nagini2019glycogensynthasekinases pages 10-10).  
Dysregulation of GSK3A is associated with a range of diseases. Its overactivity has been linked to reduced glycogen synthesis, impaired insulin signaling, and the development of insulin resistance, which are hallmarks of type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the context of Wnt signaling, aberrant GSK3A activity can lead to the stabilization of beta‐catenin and inappropriate activation of proliferative transcriptional programs, contributing to oncogenic processes. Moreover, abnormal phosphorylation of proteins such as Tau by GSK3A has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease. Although disease‐associated mutations specific to GSK3A have not been extensively characterized, alterations in its expression or regulatory phosphorylation status have been observed in various pathological states (ali2001glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-2, macaulay2008targetingglycogensynthase pages 3-4, nagini2019glycogensynthasekinases pages 10-10).  
Given its central role in multiple signaling networks and metabolic pathways, GSK3A continues to be an attractive target for therapeutic interventions. However, the broad substrate specificity and essential functions of this kinase also raise concerns regarding potential side effects that may result from systemic inhibition. As research advances, the development of isoform-selective inhibitors that can precisely modulate GSK3A activity without perturbing critical homeostatic processes remains a significant challenge. Such efforts are further informed by ongoing structural and biochemical studies aimed at delineating the distinct regulatory mechanisms that govern GSK3A function (beurel2015glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 7-9, macaulay2008targetingglycogensynthase pages 3-4).
