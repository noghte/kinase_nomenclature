1. Phylogeny  
Inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa‐B kinase subunit epsilon (IKBKE) is a member of the IκB kinase family that falls within the non‐canonical subgroup along with TANK‐binding kinase 1 (TBK1). Comparative sequence analyses indicate that IKBKE shares approximately 66% sequence similarity with TBK1 and a lower level of identity (approximately 25–30%) with the canonical IKKα and IKKβ kinases, which underscores an evolutionary divergence within the IKK-related kinases (adli2007investigatingtherole pages 10-17, adli2007investigatingtherole pages 104-109). Phylogenetic studies of the human kinome have traced these non‐canonical kinases back to a common ancestor in metazoans, and they exhibit a conserved domain architecture that is maintained in mammals and other higher eukaryotes (verhelst2013iκbkinaseɛ pages 4-5, zhou2012elucidatingtheregulation pages 14-19).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
IKBKE functions as a serine/threonine kinase that mediates the phosphorylation reaction in which a phosphate group is transferred from ATP to a serine or threonine residue present on its substrate. The overall chemical reaction catalyzed by IKBKE can be represented as:  
  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺  
This reaction is essential for modulating the activity of proteins that participate in inflammatory, antiviral, and oncogenic signaling cascades (adli2007investigatingtherole pages 10-17).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The catalytic activity of IKBKE, like that of most serine/threonine kinases, requires the presence of divalent metal ions. In particular, Mg²⁺ serves as an essential cofactor that facilitates the coordination of ATP within the active site and supports the phosphoryl transfer reaction (adli2007investigatingtherole pages 10-17, yin2020advancesinikbke pages 1-2).

4. Substrate Specificity  
IKBKE exhibits a distinct substrate specificity that underlies its role in modulating both antiviral and pro-inflammatory signaling pathways. One of its best-characterized substrates is the NF-κB subunit p65 (RelA); IKBKE phosphorylates p65 primarily at serine 536—and in some contexts at serine 468—thereby enhancing its transactivation potential and promoting the expression of downstream NF-κB-dependent genes (adli2007investigatingtherole pages 43-49, adli2007investigatingtherole pages 104-109). In addition, IKBKE phosphorylates interferon regulatory factors IRF3 and IRF7, processes that are critical for the activation and nuclear translocation of these factors and for the induction of type I interferon genes (verhelst2013iκbkinaseɛ pages 1-3, yin2020advancesinikbke pages 1-2). Other substrates include key adaptor proteins such as TRAF2, which is phosphorylated at serine 11 by IKBKE; this modification facilitates K63-linked polyubiquitination of TRAF2, thereby contributing to NF-κB pathway activation (zhou2012elucidatingtheregulation pages 124-131). IKBKE has also been reported to phosphorylate proteins such as CYLD and DDX3X, further modulating their activities within the inflammatory and antiviral response networks (zhou2012elucidatingtheregulation pages 138-145).

5. Structure  
IKBKE is a protein of approximately 66 kDa that displays a modular domain organization typical of the IKK-related kinases. At its N-terminus, IKBKE contains a catalytic kinase domain that is responsible for binding ATP and mediating phosphorylation of substrate proteins; this domain harbors critical structural features such as the activation loop, a C-helix, and a hydrophobic spine that are essential for catalytic activity (yin2020advancesinikbke pages 1-2, zhou2012elucidatingtheregulation pages 28-33). Flanking this catalytic core are protein–protein interaction modules including a leucine zipper (LZ) and a helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain, which facilitate dimerization and the assembly of multiprotein signaling complexes. Notably, IKBKE lacks a canonical NEMO-binding domain that is found in the classical IKKs, further distinguishing its regulatory properties from those of IKKα and IKKβ (verhelst2013iκbkinaseɛ pages 7-8, adli2007investigatingtherole pages 23-27). Structural models based on homology with TBK1 suggest that IKBKE also contains a ubiquitin-like domain that may contribute to its regulation via post-translational modifications (zhou2012elucidatingtheregulation pages 28-33). These domains collectively enable IKBKE to interact with specific scaffolding proteins such as TANK, NAP1, and SINTBAD, which are required for its recruitment to discrete signaling complexes.

6. Regulation  
The regulation of IKBKE occurs through a combination of transcriptional induction, post-translational modifications, and interactions with adaptor proteins. IKBKE is inducible by proinflammatory stimuli such as TNF-α, IL-1, cytokines, and lipopolysaccharide, and its expression can be upregulated via NF-κB- and STAT3-dependent transcriptional mechanisms (verhelst2013iκbkinaseɛ pages 7-8, adli2007investigatingtherole pages 43-49). A key regulatory mechanism involves K63-linked polyubiquitination of IKBKE at lysine residues K30 and K401; this modification, catalyzed by the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF2, promotes the formation of kinase-active dimers and enhances catalytic activity without directing the protein for degradation (zhou2012elucidatingtheregulation pages 151-157). In addition, IKBKE phosphorylates downstream targets that further influence its own regulatory network. For instance, phosphorylation of CYLD at serine 418 by IKBKE decreases the deubiquitinase activity of CYLD, thereby diminishing negative regulation of NF-κB signaling (zhou2012elucidatingtheregulation pages 151-157). Furthermore, IKBKE phosphorylates TRAF2 at serine 11, a modification that contributes to the assembly of signaling complexes via enhanced polyubiquitination (zhou2012elucidatingtheregulation pages 124-131). Alternative splicing generates isoforms of IKBKE that may have different regulatory properties, and autoregulatory feed-forward loops have been described wherein IKBKE activity leads to NF-κB activation that in turn drives further IKBKE expression (verhelst2013iκbkinaseɛ pages 3-4, adli2007investigatingtherole pages 43-49).

7. Function  
IKBKE serves as an essential mediator in several signaling pathways that govern innate immunity, inflammation, and oncogenesis. Upon activation by viral RNA sensors such as RIG-I-like receptors, IKBKE associates with adaptor proteins including MAVS, TANK, AZI2 (NAP1), and TBKBP1 (SINTBAD) to form multiprotein signaling complexes. Within these complexes, IKBKE phosphorylates interferon regulatory factors IRF3 and IRF7, thereby promoting their dimerization and nuclear translocation, a critical step in the transcriptional activation of type I interferon genes such as IFNB (information section, verhelst2013iκbkinaseɛ pages 7-8). Concurrently, IKBKE phosphorylates the NF-κB subunit p65 at serine 536 (and in some cases serine 468), enhancing NF-κB transcriptional responses that lead to the expression of numerous proinflammatory and antiviral genes (adli2007investigatingtherole pages 43-49, adli2007investigatingtherole pages 104-109). In addition to its canonical roles in immune signaling, IKBKE is implicated in oncogenesis. Overexpression and gene amplification of IKBKE have been observed in a significant subset of breast cancers and other malignancies, where constitutive NF-κB activation contributes to cell survival, proliferation, and chemoresistance (boehm2007integrativegenomicapproaches pages 11-12, zhou2012elucidatingtheregulation pages 138-145). Beyond NF-κB activation, IKBKE modulates STAT signaling by influencing the phosphorylation states of key transcription factors involved in cytokine responses, and it has been linked to the regulation of additional oncogenic pathways that include components of the AKT and Hippo cascades (ng2011iκbkinaseε pages 1-2, yin2020advancesinikbke pages 9-10). Expression of IKBKE is tightly regulated in a tissue- and cell type-specific manner, with baseline expression principally in immune cells and inducible expression following inflammatory stimulation (verhelst2013iκbkinaseɛ pages 7-8, yin2020advancesinikbke pages 1-2).

8. Other Comments  
IKBKE is emerging as an attractive drug target owing to its central role in mediating innate immune responses and promoting oncogenic signaling. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that small molecule inhibitors—such as Amlexanox and other dual IKBKE/TBK1 inhibitors—can inhibit IKBKE activity and, in turn, attenuate NF-κB-driven inflammatory responses and tumor cell proliferation (carr2019targetingikkεtbk1for pages 36-39, carr2019targetingikkεtbk1for pages 39-43). Overexpression or gene amplification of IKBKE has been documented in approximately 30% of breast cancers and is also associated with poor prognosis in ovarian, prostate, pancreatic, and various other cancer types (kahya2018identificationofthe pages 103-106, zhou2012elucidatingtheregulation pages 138-145, yin2020advancesinikbke pages 9-10). In addition, alterations in IKBKE regulatory mechanisms—notably aberrant K63-linked ubiquitination mediated by TRAF2—have been linked to sustained NF-κB activation, which supports chronic inflammation and tumorigenesis (zhou2012elucidatingtheregulation pages 151-157). Recent studies also indicate that microRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation contributes to the control of IKBKE expression in tumor cells, highlighting a complex regulatory network that may be exploited for therapeutic intervention (yin2020advancesinikbke pages 7-8, leonardi2019activatedkinasescreening pages 14-15). No significant disease-associated mutations within the IKBKE coding sequence have been definitively characterized; however, its dysregulation via overexpression and post-translational modifications remains a critical determinant in cancer progression and in the modulation of antiviral responses.
