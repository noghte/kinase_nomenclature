1. Phylogeny  
Inositol‑trisphosphate 3‑kinase B (ITPKB) is a member of the inositol phosphate kinase family, specifically categorized within the IP₃ 3‑kinase subgroup that also comprises ITPKA and ITPKC. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that ITPKB is evolutionarily conserved across vertebrates, and orthologs are found in a range of mammalian species including human, mouse, and rat. The kinase shares a common ancestry with other inositol phosphate metabolic enzymes, and its catalytic core is highly conserved in comparison to its paralogs. The diversification among the isoforms is largely attributable to variations in the N‑terminal regions, which in ITPKB contribute to distinct regulatory and subcellular targeting properties. This conservation suggests that ITPKB, much like its family members, has been maintained as an integral component of the phosphoinositide signaling network from early metazoans onward (schell2010inositoltrisphosphate3kinases pages 1-3, xiong2024originevolutionand pages 17-18, yang2005inositol14 pages 1-3).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
ITPKB catalyzes a single, well‐defined phosphorylation reaction in the inositol phosphate signaling cascade. The enzyme utilizes ATP as a phosphate donor to specifically phosphorylate 1D‑myo‑inositol 1,4,5‑trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P₃) at its 3‑hydroxyl group, thereby converting it into 1D‑myo‑inositol 1,3,4,5‑tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,5)P₄). This reaction can be represented by the chemical equation:  
  ATP + Ins(1,4,5)P₃ → ADP + Ins(1,3,4,5)P₄ + H⁺.  
This phosphorylation event is critical because it modulates the cellular pool of InsP₃, a key second messenger in calcium signaling, while simultaneously generating InsP₄ that functions as a signaling molecule in its own right (ahmed2015theroleof pages 138-143, chamberlain2005structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2, schell2010inositoltrisphosphate3kinases pages 1-3).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The catalytic activity of ITPKB is strictly dependent on the presence of biochemical cofactors. Chief among these is ATP, which serves as the phosphate donor required for the phosphorylation reaction. In addition, divalent metal ions, most notably magnesium (Mg²⁺), are essential cofactors as they help coordinate the proper positioning of ATP in the active site and stabilize the transition state during phosphoryl transfer. These cofactors are fundamental to the kinase mechanism and are a common requirement among enzyme families with similar catalytic functions, ensuring that the reaction proceeds with the necessary efficiency and fidelity (ahmed2015theroleof pages 138-143, chamberlain2005structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2).

4. Substrate Specificity  
ITPKB exhibits a high degree of substrate specificity for 1D‑myo‑inositol 1,4,5‑trisphosphate. The enzyme recognizes the unique arrangement of phosphate groups present on Ins(1,4,5)P₃ and selectively phosphorylates the 3‑hydroxyl group. The active site of ITPKB is precisely configured to accommodate the inositol ring, ensuring that the binding orientation supports exclusive modification at the 3‑position. This specificity is underpinned by the structural features of the substrate‐binding pocket, which discriminates against other inositol phosphate isomers or phosphoinositides that do not present the correct configuration of phosphate groups. The molecular recognition is critical for maintaining the fidelity of the intracellular signaling cascade, as only the Ins(1,4,5)P₃ substrate is processed into Ins(1,3,4,5)P₄ (schell2010inositoltrisphosphate3kinases pages 1-3, chamberlain2005structuralinsightsinto pages 6-7, yang2005inositol14 pages 1-3).

5. Structure  
Structurally, ITPKB is characterized by a well‐defined architectural organization that comprises distinct functional domains necessary for its activity and regulation. Central to its structure is a conserved kinase domain that adopts a bilobal fold typical of many protein kinases. The N‑terminal lobe is relatively small and is primarily involved in ATP binding, while the larger C‑terminal lobe forms the substrate‐binding pocket where Ins(1,4,5)P₃ is precisely oriented for phosphorylation. In addition to the catalytic core, ITPKB contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that is implicated in binding inositol phosphates and facilitating membrane association. This PH domain contributes to the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the enzyme and assists in the spatial regulation of its activity within the cell. Structural studies using crystallographic methods and computational modeling have delineated key catalytic residues and established the arrangement of secondary structure elements such as the C‑helix, activation loop, and hydrophobic spines that are integral to the enzyme’s function. Furthermore, the non‑conserved N‑terminal region harbors motifs that serve to target ITPKB to specific subcellular compartments and may enable interactions with cytoskeletal elements, thereby contributing to its functional versatility (chamberlain2005structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2, schell2010inositoltrisphosphate3kinases pages 3-5, windhorst2017inositol145trisphosphate3kinasea(itpka) pages 9-11, yang2005inositol14 pages 7-8).

6. Regulation  
The regulatory mechanisms that control ITPKB activity are multifaceted and tightly integrated with cellular signaling networks. A principal mode of regulation involves binding of calcium in complex with calmodulin, which induces a conformational change in ITPKB that alleviates autoinhibitory interactions and enhances its catalytic efficiency. This calcium/calmodulin-dependent regulation ensures that ITPKB activity is coupled to changes in intracellular calcium levels, a critical feature given the enzyme’s role in modulating calcium signaling. In addition to calmodulin binding, ITPKB is subject to post‑translational modifications such as phosphorylation by upstream kinases; these modifications can either augment or diminish its activity depending on the site and context of the modification. Furthermore, the variable N‑terminal domain of ITPKB contains regulatory sequences that govern its subcellular localization, thus enabling dynamic shuttling between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. This spatial regulation adds an extra layer of control over the enzyme’s function, permitting localized modulation of inositol phosphate metabolism in response to distinct cellular stimuli (chamberlain2005structuralinsightsinto pages 6-7, cooke2010regulationofimmune pages 10-11, shears2012definingsignaltransduction pages 5-6).

7. Function  
ITPKB plays a critical role in intracellular signal transduction primarily through its regulation of calcium homeostasis. By catalyzing the conversion of Ins(1,4,5)P₃ to Ins(1,3,4,5)P₄, ITPKB modulates the availability of InsP₃—a key second messenger responsible for initiating calcium release from intracellular stores. This conversion not only attenuates the calcium‑releasing signal generated by InsP₃ but also produces InsP₄, which serves as a second messenger capable of influencing downstream signaling pathways. Expression studies have demonstrated that ITPKB is present in both hematopoietic and neuronal tissues, where it is involved in the regulation of immune cell development and function, as well as aspects of neuronal signaling such as synaptic modulation. In immune cells, ITPKB has been implicated in T‑cell receptor signalling, where its activity influences processes such as thymocyte positive selection, B‑cell receptor responsiveness, and neutrophil chemotaxis. The enzyme’s function thus extends to controlling actin reorganization and membrane recruitment of pleckstrin homology domain‑containing proteins. The overall role of ITPKB in these diverse cellular contexts underscores its importance as a modulator of both calcium dynamics and inositol phosphate-mediated signal transduction (ahmed2015theroleof pages 138-143, cooke2010regulationofimmune pages 1-3, jia2008inositoltrisphosphate3kinase pages 1-1, schell2010inositoltrisphosphate3kinases pages 7-9, yang2005inositol14 pages 1-3).

8. Other Comments  
ITPKB has garnered attention as a potential therapeutic target given its pivotal role in regulating calcium-dependent signaling pathways and immune cell development. Although several inhibitors have been developed for inositol trisphosphate 3‑kinases in general—ranging from natural polyphenolics to synthetic compounds—a highly selective inhibitor specifically targeting ITPKB has yet to be conclusively characterized. Genetic models, including targeted gene deletions in mice, have demonstrated that loss of ITPKB function leads to significant defects in T‑cell maturation and neutrophil regulation, highlighting its critical role in maintaining immune homeostasis. In addition, alterations in ITPKB activity have been linked to pathological states involving immune dysfunction and possibly neurodegenerative processes. Ongoing research is focused on elucidating the full spectrum of ITPKB regulatory mechanisms, including its interactions with cytoskeletal elements and its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling behavior, which may further clarify its role in both physiological and pathological contexts. The extensive conservation of the catalytic domain among IP₃ 3‑kinases and the presence of unique regulatory motifs in ITPKB underscore its potential as a druggable target for modulating inositol phosphate metabolism in diseases characterized by aberrant calcium signaling and immune dysregulation (windhorst2017inositol145trisphosphate3kinasea(itpka) pages 9-11, cooke2010regulationofimmune pages 31-31, chakraborty2018theinositolpyrophosphate pages 36-37).
