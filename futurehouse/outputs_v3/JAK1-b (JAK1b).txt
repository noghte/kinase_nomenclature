1. Phylogeny  
Tyrosine‐protein kinase JAK1 is a non‐receptor tyrosine kinase that belongs to the Janus kinase (JAK) subfamily within the larger tyrosine kinase (TK) group of the human kinome. JAK1 shares a high degree of sequence and domain conservation with its paralogues, such as JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2, and is evolutionarily preserved among vertebrates. Comparative analyses based on full‐length kinase sequences and conserved catalytic domain architectures have revealed that orthologs for JAK1 exist in diverse vertebrate species including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and teleost fish. Studies using genome‐wide kinome identification in species such as the anole lizard indicate that the tyrosine kinase repertoire is remarkably stable across vertebrates, with the Janus kinase family forming a distinct, conserved clade (liu2017identificationandcharacterization pages 5-7, liu2017identificationandcharacterization pages 9-11, forrest2003phosphoregulatorsproteinkinases pages 1-2). In this phylogenetic framework, the evolutionary origin of JAK1 can be traced back to early metazoan ancestors that possessed fundamental signaling modules responsible for cytokine receptor–mediated signal transduction. The evolutionary history of the human kinome, as outlined in seminal works by Manning et al., further supports the classification of JAK1 among core signaling molecules that emerged during animal evolution (forrest2003phosphoregulatorsproteinkinases pages 6-7, corey1999srcrelatedproteintyrosine pages 1-2).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
JAK1 catalyzes an ATP‐dependent tyrosine phosphorylation reaction. In this enzymatic process, the kinase binds adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and a protein substrate containing one or more tyrosine residues. JAK1 facilitates the transfer of the gamma (γ) phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl (-OH) group of a specific tyrosine residue on the target protein. The chemical reaction can be written as follows:  
  ATP + Protein–OH (tyrosine) → ADP + Protein–O–PO3^2– (phosphotyrosine) + H^+  
This reaction is fundamental to the activation of downstream signaling cascades that control processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and immune responses (corey1999srcrelatedproteintyrosine pages 14-15, corey1999srcrelatedproteintyrosine pages 8-10).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The catalytic activity of JAK1, like that of most protein kinases, depends on the presence of divalent metal ion cofactors. In particular, magnesium ions (Mg^2+) are required to coordinate and stabilize the binding of ATP within the kinase active site, facilitating the transfer of the phosphate group. This cofactor not only assists in orienting ATP correctly relative to the catalytic residues but also plays a critical role in the transition state stabilization during phosphoryl transfer (forrest2003phosphoregulatorsproteinkinases pages 5-6).

4. Substrate Specificity  
JAK1 phosphorylates specific tyrosine residues on receptor substrates and downstream signaling proteins, such as members of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family. Although a precise consensus peptide motif for JAK1 has not been as definitively characterized as for some serine/threonine kinases, its substrate specificity is evident from its role in phosphorylating critical components of cytokine receptor complexes. For instance, in response to interferon binding, JAK1 phosphorylates the intracellular domain of the interferon receptor subunit IFNAR2, thereby creating docking sites for STAT proteins. In addition, JAK1 has been observed to phosphorylate peptides derived from receptor sequences that contain adjacent acidic residues near the target tyrosine. This feature is consistent with the general substrate recognition mode of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, where a relatively broad yet selective substrate signature permits the phosphorylation of multiple downstream effectors involved in immune regulation and hematopoietic signaling (corey1999srcrelatedproteintyrosine pages 14-15, fabbro2015tenthingsyou pages 4-5).

5. Structure  
The overall architecture of JAK1 is characterized by a modular domain organization that is typical of the Janus kinase family. At the N-terminus, JAK1 contains a FERM (4.1 protein, ezrin, radixin, moesin) domain that mediates interaction with the cytoplasmic regions of cytokine receptors. Immediately following the FERM domain, an SH2-like domain is present, which contributes further to receptor association and specificity. Central to JAK1’s regulatory mechanism is the pseudokinase domain (JH2), which, despite its high sequence similarity to active kinase domains, lacks full catalytic activity and functions in autoinhibition by modulating the conformation and activity of the subsequent kinase domain. At the C-terminus, the catalytic kinase domain (JH1) executes the phosphorylation reaction. This domain adopts a bilobal structure comprising a smaller N-terminal lobe and a larger C-terminal lobe, connected by a flexible hinge region. The N-lobe is involved in anchoring the phosphate groups of ATP via a glycine-rich loop, while the C-lobe contains the activation loop (A-loop) and conserved motifs such as the DFG (Asp-Phe-Gly) motif, which are essential for catalysis and substrate binding (liu2017identificationandcharacterization pages 2-4, forrest2003phosphoregulatorsproteinkinases pages 6-7, corey1999srcrelatedproteintyrosine pages 14-15). Structural models derived from sequence comparisons and experimental data indicate that the juxtaposition of the pseudokinase and kinase domains permits a finely tuned regulatory mechanism whereby conformational changes induced by receptor binding and subsequent phosphorylation events relieve autoinhibition, thereby activating the kinase domain.

6. Regulation  
JAK1 regulation is intricately linked to its ability to associate with cytokine receptors and respond to extracellular signals. In the resting state, JAK1 is maintained in an inactive conformation; its catalytic activity is suppressed by the autoinhibitory influence of the pseudokinase (JH2) domain. Upon binding of ligands—such as interferons or interleukins—to their cognate receptor complexes (e.g., IFNAR1/IFNAR2, IL-2 receptor, and IL-10 receptor), receptor dimerization or conformational rearrangement occurs. This event facilitates the close apposition of receptor-bound JAK1 molecules, triggering trans- or autophosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues located within the activation loop of the kinase domain. The phosphorylation of these tyrosine residues is a critical switch that converts JAK1 from an inactive to an active state, thereby enabling it to phosphorylate downstream substrates such as STAT transcription factors (corey1999srcrelatedproteintyrosine pages 7-8, corey1999srcrelatedproteintyrosine pages 14-15). Moreover, the interaction of JAK1 with receptor components via its FERM and SH2-like domains not only ensures specificity but also contributes to allosteric regulation of its kinase activity. These regulatory mechanisms secure tight control over JAK1-mediated signal transduction in response to cytokine stimulation, preventing aberrant activation under basal conditions (forrest2003phosphoregulatorsproteinkinases pages 1-2, liu2017identificationandcharacterization pages 12-13).

7. Function  
JAK1 plays a central role in cytokine‐mediated signaling pathways, particularly within the interferon (IFN) and interleukin (IL) systems. Acting as a key kinase partner, JAK1 associates with receptor subunits such as IFNAR2 of the type I interferon receptor complex. Engagement of the receptor by interferon ligands (IFN‐α, IFN‐β, and IFN‐γ) triggers conformational changes that activate JAK1. Once activated, JAK1 phosphorylates IFNAR2 and creates binding sites for STAT proteins via phosphotyrosine motifs. The recruited STATs are subsequently phosphorylated, dimerize, and translocate to the nucleus where they modulate gene expression programs related to antiviral defense, immune regulation, and hematopoietic cell survival. In addition to its role in interferon signaling, JAK1 functions as a kinase partner for the IL-2 and IL-10 receptors, contributing to the regulation of lymphocyte activity and anti-inflammatory responses. The broad expression of JAK1 in immune cells underscores its importance in maintaining balanced cytokine signaling and ensuring proper immune function (corey1999srcrelatedproteintyrosine pages 7-8, corey1999srcrelatedproteintyrosine pages 14-15, liu2017identificationandcharacterization pages 12-13).

8. Other Comments  
JAK1 is clinically significant due to its central role in mediating immune and inflammatory responses. Dysregulation or aberrant activation of JAK1 has been associated with various immune disorders and hematologic malignancies. As such, JAK1 and other members of the Janus kinase family have emerged as attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. Several small-molecule inhibitors that target the ATP-binding site of JAK kinases have been developed and are undergoing clinical evaluation for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, inflammatory conditions, and certain cancers. The development of these inhibitors is predicated on the ability to selectively modulate JAK1 activity without adversely affecting other signaling pathways, a goal that is aided by our detailed understanding of its domain organization, regulatory mechanisms, and substrate specificity (fabbro2015tenthingsyou pages 4-5, forrest2003phosphoregulatorsproteinkinases pages 8-9).
