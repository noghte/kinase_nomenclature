1. Phylogeny  
KIT, also known as c‐Kit or the stem cell growth factor receptor (SCFR), is a member of the Class III receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family that is evolutionarily conserved across vertebrates (berenstein2015classiiireceptor pages 1-2). Orthologs of KIT have been identified in all mammalian species and in many other vertebrates, indicating its deep evolutionary origin and maintenance from early vertebrate lineages (boissan2000ckitandckit pages 1-2, krupa2002therepertoireof pages 9-10). Within the kinome, KIT belongs to the group of receptor tyrosine kinases that share a modular architecture similar to that of other members such as the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and FMS-like tyrosine kinase (FLT3), and its grouping has been firmly established in genomic surveys of the human kinome (berenstein2015classiiireceptor pages 1-2, boissan2000ckitandckit pages 1-2). Comparative genomic analyses, as originally reported by Manning and colleagues, place KIT alongside other evolutionarily conserved RTKs whose common ancestry can be traced back to early metazoans (krupa2002therepertoireof pages 9-10). The evolutionary divergence observed between receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases is underscored by the unique extracellular architecture of KIT comprising immunoglobulin-like domains that are absent in most cytoplasmic kinases (berenstein2015classiiireceptor pages 1-2, boissan2000ckitandckit pages 1-2). This phylogenetic context underlines KIT’s role as a critical mediator of cell–cell communication in multicellular organisms and its importance in fundamental biological processes such as hematopoiesis, melanogenesis, and gametogenesis (boissan2000ckitandckit pages 1-2).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
KIT catalyzes the phosphorylation reaction in which the γ-phosphate from ATP is transferred to tyrosine residues on specific protein substrates, thereby generating ADP, a phosphotyrosine-substituted protein, and a proton (hunter1998thecroonianlecture pages 3-6). This classical reaction is the hallmark of protein-tyrosine kinases and is fundamental to the initiation and propagation of downstream signaling cascades (mazola2008proteinkinasesas pages 1-2). In its active state, KIT phosphorylates substrates such as the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PIK3R1), phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLCG1), the adaptor protein SH2B2 (APS), and the E3 ubiquitin ligase CBL, among others (berenstein2015classiiireceptor pages 12-12). The efficient transfer of the phosphate group is essential for propagating signals that ultimately regulate cellular survival, proliferation, and differentiation (hunter1998thecroonianlecture pages 3-6).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The catalytic function of KIT, like other protein kinases, depends on the presence of divalent cations, with magnesium (Mg²⁺) being a critical cofactor (fischer2004thedesignof pages 1-2). Mg²⁺ coordinates with ATP within the kinase active site and stabilizes the transition state during the phosphoryl transfer reaction (fischer2004thedesignof pages 1-2). This requirement for magnesium is a common feature among kinases and is essential to achieve a conformation of the nucleotide that permits the efficient transfer of the phosphate group to tyrosine substrates (fischer2004thedesignof pages 1-2).

4. Substrate Specificity  
The intrinsic substrate specificity of KIT is determined by the amino acid context surrounding the tyrosine residues that serve as phosphorylation sites (yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 16-16). Although a single consensus motif has not been universally defined for KIT, studies of the human tyrosine kinome indicate that receptor tyrosine kinases like KIT exhibit preferences dictated by the flanking sequences of the target tyrosine residues (yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 1-2). Functionally, KIT recognizes and phosphorylates a set of substrates that include PIK3R1 – the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase – and PLCG1, among others (berenstein2015classiiireceptor pages 12-12). The selective phosphorylation of these substrates contributes to the activation of diverse downstream cascades such as the PI3K/AKT, RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK, and STAT pathways (boissan2000ckitandckit pages 3-4, berenstein2015classiiireceptor pages 12-12). In vitro assays and peptide array analyses have been instrumental in elucidating these substrate preferences even though the exact consensus sequence for KIT remains less stringently defined compared to some serine/threonine kinases (yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 16-16).

5. Structure  
The structure of KIT is organized into several distinct domains that confer its functional versatility. Its extracellular portion comprises five immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domains that collectively mediate specific binding to its ligand, stem cell factor (SCF) (boissan2000ckitandckit pages 1-2, berenstein2015classiiireceptor pages 3-4). Following the extracellular region is the transmembrane domain, a single α-helical segment that anchors the receptor in the plasma membrane and facilitates ligand-induced dimerization (boissan2000ckitandckit pages 1-2). Immediately cytoplasmic to the membrane is the juxtamembrane domain, a region that in the inactive conformation exerts an autoinhibitory effect by stabilizing the receptor in a low-activity state (boissan2000ckitandckit pages 3-4, berenstein2015classiiireceptor pages 3-4). The intracellular region of KIT consists of a bipartite tyrosine kinase domain, which is subdivided into an ATP-binding lobe and a phosphotransferase (catalytic) lobe (boissan2000ckitandckit pages 6-7, boissan2000ckitandckit pages 8-10). Within the tyrosine kinase domain, key structural elements include the activation loop—whose phosphorylation status directly impacts catalytic activity—and the C-helix, which is crucial for coordinating ATP binding and substrate alignment (berenstein2015classiiireceptor pages 3-4, boissan2000ckitandckit pages 10-11). In addition, several mutation hotspots, such as the well-documented Asp816 residue in the activation loop, have been identified; mutations in this region (e.g., Asp816Val) disrupt autoinhibition and lead to constitutive kinase activation (boissan2000ckitandckit pages 11-12, dixit2009sequenceandstructure pages 10-11). Structural studies employing crystallography and computational modeling have provided detailed views of these domains, demonstrating the compact folding of the kinase core and the regulatory influence of the juxtamembrane region in maintaining receptor inactivity until ligand engagement (berenstein2015classiiireceptor pages 3-4, boissan2000ckitandckit pages 13-14).

6. Regulation  
KIT’s activity is tightly regulated through multiple mechanisms that ensure precise control of its signaling output. In its resting state, the juxtamembrane domain of KIT functions as an autoinhibitory module, preventing unscheduled kinase activation by sterically hindering the proper alignment of the kinase domain for catalysis (boissan2000ckitandckit pages 3-4, berenstein2015classiiireceptor pages 3-4). Binding of the ligand SCF induces receptor dimerization, which relieves this autoinhibition and triggers trans-autophosphorylation of multiple tyrosine residues within the intracellular domain (boissan2000ckitandckit pages 6-7, berenstein2015classiiireceptor pages 1-2). These autophosphorylation events create docking sites for downstream signaling molecules, such as the p85 subunit of PI3K, GRB2, and other adaptor proteins, thereby amplifying and diversifying the signal (boissan2000ckitandckit pages 11-11, boissan2000ckitandckit pages 7-8). In addition, the receptor is subject to negative regulation via protein tyrosine phosphatases, which dephosphorylate critical tyrosine residues and attenuate the signal (boissan2000ckitandckit pages 13-14). KIT’s regulatory mechanisms are further modulated by receptor internalization and ubiquitin-mediated degradation, processes that limit the duration and intensity of the signaling response (boissan2000ckitandckit pages 11-12). Mutations in regulatory domains, particularly within the juxtamembrane and kinase regions, can disrupt these control mechanisms and lead to ligand-independent, constitutive activity of KIT, a phenomenon that is frequently associated with oncogenic transformation in mastocytosis and other hematologic malignancies (boissan2000ckitandckit pages 2-3, dixit2009sequenceandstructure pages 13-14).

7. Function  
KIT plays a central role in controlling a broad range of cellular processes, largely due to its ability to activate several key intracellular signaling pathways. Upon binding its ligand SCF, KIT undergoes dimerization and autophosphorylation, initiating cascades that regulate cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, and migration (berenstein2015classiiireceptor pages 12-12, boissan2000ckitandckit pages 1-2). KIT is critically involved in hematopoiesis by promoting the survival and proliferation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells; it also serves vital functions in the development and function of mast cells, melanocytes, and germ cells (boissan2000ckitandckit pages 3-4, berenstein2015classiiireceptor pages 1-2). Downstream of KIT, activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway occurs through phosphorylation of PIK3R1, which contributes to cell survival and anti-apoptotic signaling (berenstein2015classiiireceptor pages 12-12, boissan2000ckitandckit pages 7-8). Concurrently, the RAS/RAF/MAPK cascade is engaged via adaptor proteins such as GRB2, further promoting cell proliferation and differentiation (boissan2000ckitandckit pages 8-10, berenstein2015classiiireceptor pages 12-12). Moreover, activation of PLCG1 by KIT leads to the production of second messengers such as diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, which are responsible for calcium mobilization and additional signaling events (boissan2000ckitandckit pages 11-12, berenstein2015classiiireceptor pages 12-12). KIT is also known to stimulate the STAT family of transcription factors (STAT1, STAT3, STAT5A, and STAT5B), thereby directly influencing gene expression programs involved in growth and differentiation (boissan2000ckitandckit pages 14-14, berenstein2015classiiireceptor pages 12-12). Collectively, these pathways underscore the importance of KIT in normal physiological processes such as stem cell maintenance, immune cell development, and pigmentation, as well as its role in oncogenesis when deregulated (amit2007evolvablesignalingnetworks pages 2-3).

8. Other Comments  
Aberrant KIT signaling is implicated in a variety of diseases, most notably in several hematologic malignancies and in mastocytosis. In many cases, activating mutations—such as the substitution of aspartic acid to valine at residue 816 (D816V)—lead to ligand-independent receptor activation and uncontrolled cell proliferation (boissan2000ckitandckit pages 11-12, dixit2009sequenceandstructure pages 10-11). These mutations alter the conformation of the activation loop and disrupt autoinhibitory interactions, thereby rendering the receptor constitutively active (boissan2000ckitandckit pages 11-12, dixit2009sequenceandstructure pages 10-11). Clinically, such dysregulation has been observed in conditions including gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), mastocytosis, and various forms of leukemia (torkamani2009cancerdrivermutations pages 17-18, hunter1998thecroonianlecture pages 16-17). In parallel, several small molecule inhibitors targeting KIT’s kinase domain have been developed for therapeutic intervention; imatinib mesylate is one of the most well-known examples, although resistance arising from secondary mutations can limit its clinical efficacy (mazola2008proteinkinasesas pages 1-2, kannaiyan2018acomprehensivereview pages 50-55). Other inhibitors under investigation aim to overcome resistance mechanisms by targeting alternative conformations of the kinase domain or modulating downstream signaling pathways (margutti2007aremapkinases pages 5-6, torkamani2008predictionofcancer pages 9-9). These therapeutic strategies highlight the clinical impact of KIT dysregulation and underscore the need for precise molecular diagnostics to guide targeted treatments (torkamani2009cancerdrivermutations pages 17-18).
