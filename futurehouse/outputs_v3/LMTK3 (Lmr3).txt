1. Phylogeny  
Serine/threonine‐protein kinase LMTK3 (also known as Lmr3 or KIAA1883, UniProt ID Q96Q04) belongs to the lemur tail kinase family, which comprises LMTK1, LMTK2, and LMTK3. LMTK3 shares a conserved kinase domain and a characteristic long C‐terminal tail with its family members, which distinguishes this group from classical receptor tyrosine kinases owing to its exclusive serine/threonine phosphorylation activity. Orthologs of LMTK3 have been identified in a number of mammalian species, indicating its conservation across evolution; analyses suggest that the evolutionary pressures in mammals have maintained the core regulatory functions associated with intracellular trafficking and signal transduction. Phylogenetic analyses based on conserved catalytic motifs and domain organization place LMTK3 within a distinct branch of the human serine/threonine kinome, with its kinship to LMTK1 and LMTK2 clearly delineated by sequence homology and structural conservation. This grouping is supported by evolutionary studies that trace the origins of the lemur tail kinases to an ancestral kinase gene prior to the divergence of mammals, consistent with analyses reported in the literature on kinase evolution and the kinome complement of humans (ditsiou2021themultifacetedrole pages 1-2, morotz2024arevisednomenclature pages 1-3). Moreover, the revised nomenclature proposed by international consensus conferences has further clarified the evolutionary relationships within the LMTK family, ensuring that LMTK3 is recognized as a serine/threonine‐specific enzyme despite historical misinterpretations of its catalytic potential (morotz2024arevisednomenclature pages 3-3, wendler2021thelmtkfamilyof pages 17-20). The distinct phylogenetic position of LMTK3 also parallels the finding that its substrate specificity and regulatory interactions have evolved to meet specialized functions in both oncogenic and neuronal contexts, with conservation across species reinforcing its fundamental role in diverse signaling pathways (vella2022divingintothe pages 2-3, stebbing2011lemurtyrosinekinase3 pages 1-2).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
LMTK3 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues on protein substrates. The reaction can be succinctly represented as follows:  
  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(phospho-L-serine/threonine) + H⁺  
This fundamental phosphorylation reaction underpins the modulation of substrate activity in signal transduction pathways and is characteristic of serine/threonine kinases in general (agnarelli2023theinhibitoryproperties pages 1-3, ditsiou2021themultifacetedrole pages 1-2). The chemical transformation involves the binding of ATP at the kinase active site, coordinated by conserved residues that orient the gamma-phosphate for nucleophilic attack by the substrate hydroxyl, thereby resulting in the formation of a phosphoester linkage (ferrari2021lemurtyrosinekinases pages 3-5).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The enzymatic activity of LMTK3 is dependent on the presence of ATP as the phosphoryl donor, and like many serine/threonine kinases, its catalytic action is facilitated by divalent metal ions. In particular, Mg²⁺ is required to coordinate ATP binding in the active site and to stabilize the phosphate groups during the transfer reaction. These cofactor requirements are consistent with the catalytic mechanisms observed in the broader family of serine/threonine kinases, wherein Mg²⁺ plays an essential role in ensuring efficient phosphorylation of substrate proteins (ferrari2021lemurtyrosinekinases pages 3-5, wendler2021thelmtkfamilyof pages 6-10, agnarelli2023theinhibitoryproperties pages 1-3).

4. Substrate Specificity  
LMTK3 exhibits substrate specificity that is defined by its ability to recognize serine and threonine residues within a particular amino acid context. Studies have identified that LMTK3 phosphorylates substrates such as estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1), thereby protecting ESR1 from ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. In addition to ESR1, experimental data from positional scanning peptide libraries have revealed that LMTK3 favors substrate motifs that incorporate basic residues, frequently requiring arginine residues at positions –3 and/or –2 relative to the phosphoacceptor site; for example, a peptide such as WRRFSFCMC has been used as a model substrate in vitro (ditsiou2021themultifacetedrole pages 8-9, agnarelli2023theinhibitoryproperties pages 3-4). Other putative substrates include heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) and components involved in receptor trafficking, with evidence suggesting that LMTK3 may target proteins implicated in the regulation of endocytic recycling and membrane dynamics. The consensus substrate motif emerging from these studies underlines the enzyme’s preference for a serine or threonine residue flanked by basic amino acids and possibly proline residues downstream, which is in accord with the substrate preferences reported for several serine/threonine kinases (ditsiou2021themultifacetedrole pages 2-3, vella2022divingintothe pages 2-3). This substrate specificity is critical for the discrete modulation of signaling pathways in both oncogenic contexts—by stabilizing ESR1 and modulating receptor-mediated transcription—and neuronal processes, where the trafficking of NMDA receptors may be regulated (agnarelli2023theinhibitoryproperties pages 1-3, ditsiou2021themultifacetedrole pages 7-8).

5. Structure  
LMTK3 is characterized by a modular structure that encompasses distinct regions responsible for catalytic activity and regulatory interactions. The N-terminal part of the protein contains a signal peptide and a transmembrane helical segment that anchor LMTK3 to intracellular membranes, thereby localizing its enzymatic activity to specific subcellular compartments. Central to the protein is the well-conserved kinase domain, which is responsible for binding ATP and catalyzing the phosphorylation reaction. This domain comprises a nucleotide-binding pocket, catalytic loop, and an activation segment that likely undergoes conformational changes upon phosphorylation; key conserved residues in this domain include a catalytic aspartate and an ATP-binding lysine, both of which are essential for enzyme function (agnarelli2023theinhibitoryproperties pages 1-3, ditsiou2021themultifacetedrole pages 1-2). Beyond the kinase domain, LMTK3 possesses a long, intrinsically disordered C-terminal region enriched with proline-rich motifs. These regions are thought to facilitate protein-protein interactions, serving as scaffolds for the recruitment of regulatory proteins such as SH3 domain-containing factors, chaperones, and other signaling molecules (morotz2024arevisednomenclature pages 3-4, wendler2021thelmtkfamilyof pages 13-17). Structural predictions based on homology modeling and emerging AlphaFold data indicate that while the kinase domain adopts the typical bilobal architecture seen in many protein kinases—with an N-terminal lobe dominated by β-strands and a C-terminal lobe comprising α-helices—the C-terminal tail remains largely unstructured, potentially undergoing folding upon binding to partner proteins (ferrari2021lemurtyrosinekinases pages 3-5, larose2024thelemurtail pages 2-4). In addition, the presence of transmembrane domains and nuclear localization/export signals suggests that LMTK3 is a multi‐compartmental enzyme, capable of functioning at the plasma membrane, within the cytoplasm, and even in the nucleus where it has been implicated in chromatin-associated regulatory functions. The unique combination of structured and disordered regions implies that LMTK3 is capable of dynamic conformational rearrangements necessary for its dual roles in catalytic activity and scaffold‐mediated signaling (ditsiou2021themultifacetedrole pages 1-2, morotz2024arevisednomenclature pages 1-3, wendler2021thelmtkfamilyof pages 24-29). Key features such as the activation loop, which may contain phosphorylation sites targeted by kinases like CDK5, and a hydrophobic spine that supports the active conformation, are common to many kinases and are expected to be conserved in LMTK3 as well (sarma2018unveilingthetransient pages 4-6, ferrari2021lemurtyrosinekinases pages 3-5).

6. Regulation  
The activity of LMTK3 is subject to regulation by various post-translational modifications and protein-protein interactions that modulate its catalytic function and stability. Phosphorylation plays a central role in regulating LMTK3; in vitro studies and in silico modeling have identified potential phosphorylation sites within the activation segment (for example, Thr167 and Thr189) that may be targeted by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), an interaction that has been explored through molecular docking and dynamics simulations (sarma2018unveilingthetransient pages 4-6, sarma2018unveilingthetransient pages 6-7). LMTK3 exerts a regulatory influence on the estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) by directly phosphorylating it, an action that protects ESR1 from ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. In addition to its direct phosphorylation events, LMTK3 modulates upstream signaling pathways by decreasing the enzymatic activity of protein kinase C (PKC) and reducing subsequent AKT phosphorylation; this reduction in AKT activity enhances the binding of the transcriptional activator FOXO3 to the ESR1 promoter, thereby increasing ESR1 transcription (agnarelli2023theinhibitoryproperties pages 1-3, ditsiou2021themultifacetedrole pages 5-6). Regulatory interactions also include associations with molecular chaperones such as HSP90 and CDC37, which are essential for maintaining the proper folding and stability of LMTK3, ensuring its functional conformation in the cellular environment (ditsiou2021themultifacetedrole pages 9-10). Furthermore, LMTK3 expression and activity are subject to modulation by non-coding RNAs; microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs have been implicated in fine-tuning LMTK3 levels, with specific microRNAs reducing its mRNA and protein abundance and long non-coding RNAs contributing to its transcriptional upregulation (ditsiou2021themultifacetedrole pages 8-9). These layers of regulation, which include direct post-translational modifications, chaperone-mediated stabilization, and RNA-based control mechanisms, converge to determine the cellular activity of LMTK3 in a context-dependent manner. The integration of these regulatory inputs allows LMTK3 to act as a nodal point in both kinase signaling cascades and receptor-mediated transcriptional control (ditsiou2021themultifacetedrole pages 7-8, agnarelli2023theinhibitoryproperties pages 1-3).

7. Function  
LMTK3 serves multifaceted roles in cellular physiology, with prominent functions in both oncogenic signaling and neuronal receptor trafficking. In the context of breast cancer, LMTK3 phosphorylates estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) to protect it from proteasomal degradation and thereby sustain ERα-dependent transcription, contributing to tumor cell proliferation and survival. This kinase not only stabilizes ESR1 at the protein level but also indirectly influences ESR1 expression by diminishing PKC activity, which leads to a decrease in AKT phosphorylation; the resulting increase in FOXO3 binding to the ESR1 promoter enhances ESR1 transcription (agnarelli2023theinhibitoryproperties pages 1-3, ditsiou2021themultifacetedrole pages 5-6). Aside from its oncogenic role in endocrine resistance, LMTK3 has been implicated in the regulation of endocytic trafficking processes that are critical for neuronal function. In neurons, LMTK3 is involved in the internalization and recycling of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR), a function that is essential for the maintenance of synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission (larose2024thelemurtail pages 2-4, larose2024thelemurtail pages 4-5). Furthermore, LMTK3 participates in broader signaling networks that regulate cell proliferation, invasion, and survival across various cancer types, including colorectal, gastric, and potentially prostate cancers (ditsiou2021themultifacetedrole pages 8-9, ferrari2021lemurtyrosinekinases pages 1-2). The enzyme’s ability to serve both as a catalytic kinase and as a scaffold protein for the assembly of signaling complexes underscores its versatility in modulating diverse cellular pathways. Through its interactions with chaperone complexes, transcriptional regulators, and endocytic machinery, LMTK3 integrates extracellular signals with intracellular responses, thereby playing a central role in the coordination of receptor-mediated events and gene expression programs (ditsiou2021themultifacetedrole pages 10-11, vella2022divingintothe pages 1-2). These functions collectively highlight the importance of LMTK3 in governing cellular homeostasis and its potential impact on disease progression when dysregulated.

8. Other Comments  
LMTK3 is recognized as a promising therapeutic target in cancer, particularly in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer where its overexpression correlates with poor clinical outcomes and resistance to endocrine therapies. Selective small-molecule inhibitors, such as compounds designated C28 and C36, have been identified that target the ATP-binding pocket of LMTK3, leading to its destabilization and subsequent degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. These inhibitors have been characterized using a combination of biochemical assays and chemoinformatics approaches, highlighting their high binding affinity and selectivity for LMTK3 over other kinases (agnarelli2023theinhibitoryproperties pages 13-14, agnarelli2023theinhibitoryproperties pages 3-4, alrumaihi2024chemoinformaticsandmachine pages 1-2). In parallel, machine learning techniques have further contributed to the identification of novel inhibitory scaffolds against LMTK3, providing a computational framework for future drug design efforts (alrumaihi2024chemoinformaticsandmachine pages 13-13). In addition to its role in oncogenesis, LMTK3 has also been implicated in neuronal functions by virtue of its involvement in the trafficking of NMDA receptors; this suggests that, beyond cancer, LMTK3 might play roles in synaptic regulation and potentially in neurodegenerative processes, although further studies are needed to fully delineate these functions (larose2024thelemurtail pages 8-9, ditsiou2021themultifacetedrole pages 1-2). Overall, the dual functionality of LMTK3—mediating both receptor stabilization in cancer cells and receptor trafficking in neurons—underscores its potential as a drug target in multiple disease settings while also presenting challenges for the development of highly selective therapeutic agents that can modulate its activity without affecting related kinases.
