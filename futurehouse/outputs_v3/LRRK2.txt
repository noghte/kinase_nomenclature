1. Phylogeny  
LRRK2 belongs to the ROCO family of proteins, a group defined by the presence of a Ras of complex (ROC) GTPase domain in tandem with a C-terminal of ROC (COR) domain and a serine/threonine kinase domain. This multidomain architecture is evolutionarily conserved among vertebrates, and although LRRK2 shares significant sequence homology with its paralog LRRK1, only LRRK2 has been genetically linked to Parkinson’s disease (PD) (berwick2012lrrk2functionsas pages 1-2, liu2017thedualenzyme pages 1-3, tsika2012mechanismsoflrrk2mediated pages 1-3). Comparative analyses further reveal structural and evolutionary relationships with RIP kinases and other serine/threonine kinases involved in cell signaling, suggesting that LRRK2 is part of an ancient kinase superfamily that emerged early in eukaryotic evolution (nichols2017lrrk2phosphorylation pages 205-207, verma2014erkedbylrrk2 pages 3-4).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
The enzymatic reaction catalyzed by LRRK2 is the transfer of the γ-phosphate group from ATP to a serine or threonine residue on its protein substrates. In this phosphorylation reaction, ATP is converted to ADP while the target protein is modified to incorporate a phosphate group on its hydroxyl side chain, with the concomitant release of a proton (dzamko2012theikappabkinase pages 1-2, nichols2009substratespecificityand pages 1-2).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
LRRK2’s kinase activity is dependent on the presence of ATP, which serves as the phosphate donor. The reaction is further dependent on divalent cations, with Mg²⁺ being the essential cofactor that facilitates proper coordination of ATP within the catalytic cleft (dzamko2012theikappabkinase pages 1-2, verma2014erkedbylrrk2 pages 1-3).

4. Substrate Specificity  
LRRK2 phosphorylates a broad array of substrates, with a marked preference for threonine residues in its target proteins. This kinase’s substrate spectrum prominently features several Rab GTPases, whose phosphorylation modulates their GTP/GDP exchange and interaction with effector proteins. Specifically, LRRK2 phosphorylates members of the Rab family—including RAB3A, RAB3B, RAB3C, RAB3D, RAB5A, RAB5B, RAB5C, RAB8A, RAB8B, RAB10, RAB12, RAB29, RAB35, and RAB43—as well as other factors involved in vesicular trafficking (purlyte2018rab29activationof pages 17-17, nichols2009substratespecificityand pages 1-2). Optimized peptide assays have confirmed that LRRK2’s kinase domain favors substrate sequences in which a threonine residue is embedded in a defined amino acid context, although a singular consensus motif has not been universally established (dzamko2012theikappabkinase pages 1-2, nichols2009substratespecificityand pages 1-2).

5. Structure  
LRRK2 is a large multidomain enzyme comprising 2527 amino acids. Its N-terminal region contains leucine‑rich repeats (LRRs) that facilitate protein–protein interactions. Centrally located is the catalytic core, which is composed of a ROC (Ras of complex proteins) domain responsible for binding and hydrolyzing GTP, immediately followed by a COR (C-terminal of ROC) domain that promotes dimerization and serves as a linker. Downstream lies the serine/threonine kinase domain, which adopts a bilobal structure typical of protein kinases and contains key features such as an activation loop and a conserved DFG motif; the common G2019S mutation is positioned within this activation segment and is associated with enhanced kinase activity (berwick2012lrrk2functionsas pages 1-2, liu2017thedualenzyme pages 1-3, verma2014erkedbylrrk2 pages 3-4). The C-terminal portion of LRRK2 contains WD40 repeats that are implicated in additional protein–protein interactions and regulatory processes. While the full-length three-dimensional structure remains unresolved, homology models and partial domain structures obtained by X‑ray crystallography and AlphaFold indicate that interdomain contacts, particularly between the ROC and COR domains, are critical for LRRK2’s regulatory mechanism (tsika2012mechanismsoflrrk2mediated pages 1-3, verma2014erkedbylrrk2 pages 3-4).

6. Regulation  
LRRK2 is subject to complex regulatory mechanisms mediated predominantly via phosphorylation. Autophosphorylation events—such as at Ser1292—serve as markers of its intrinsic kinase activity, while additional phosphorylation at residues including Ser910, Ser935, Ser955, and Ser973 is crucial for the binding of 14-3-3 proteins. This interaction with 14-3-3 factors regulates LRRK2’s subcellular localization and stability (nichols2017lrrk2phosphorylation pages 81-83, nichols2017lrrk2phosphorylation pages 147-149). In addition, upstream kinases modify LRRK2, and pathogenic mutations (e.g., G2019S, I2020T, R1441C) alter its phosphorylation status as well as the balance between its kinase and GTPase activities. The interplay between these phosphorylation events and the binding of regulatory proteins, such as 14-3-3, contributes to conformational changes required for full enzymatic activation and proper intracellular distribution (dzamko2012theikappabkinase pages 1-2, ohta2015i2020tmutantlrrk2 pages 10-15, herzig2011lrrk2proteinlevels pages 1-2).

7. Function  
Functionally, LRRK2 acts as a serine/threonine-protein kinase with pleiotropic roles in cellular signaling. It phosphorylates an array of substrates involved in neuronal plasticity, vesicular trafficking, autophagy, and innate immune responses. A central aspect of its function is the regulation of Rab GTPases—proteins that govern membrane trafficking events. By phosphorylating Rab proteins (including those of the RAB3, RAB5, RAB8, RAB10, RAB12, RAB29, RAB35, and RAB43 families), LRRK2 modulates their interactions with regulatory factors and effectors, thereby influencing vesicle formation, transport, and recycling (purlyte2018rab29activationof pages 17-17, nichols2009substratespecificityand pages 1-2). LRRK2 is highly expressed in dopamine-innervated brain regions, consistent with its involvement in neuronal function and survival, and it is also present in cells of the innate immune system. In neurons, aberrant LRRK2 activity is linked to processes such as impaired autophagic flux, altered protein synthesis and degradation pathways, and cytoskeletal reorganization—all of which contribute to degenerative processes observed in PD (berwick2012lrrk2functionsas pages 8-10, pellegrini2018proteomicanalysisreveals pages 1-1, tsika2012mechanismsoflrrk2mediated pages 1-3, stafa2014functionalinteractionof pages 1-2). Additionally, LRRK2’s regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and its interaction with members of the dynamin GTPase superfamily further integrate it into networks controlling neuronal integrity (verma2014erkedbylrrk2 pages 1-3).

8. Other Comments  
LRRK2 is a central therapeutic target in Parkinson’s disease due to the strong genetic associations of mutations—including G2019S, I2020T, and R1441C—with familial and sporadic forms of the disorder. Pathogenic mutations generally result in a toxic gain-of-function, characterized by increased kinase activity. Inhibitors such as LRRK2-IN-1 have been developed to target its kinase domain, and their effectiveness is monitored in cellular models by assessing downstream Rab phosphorylation events (berwick2012lrrk2functionsas pages 8-10, ohta2015i2020tmutantlrrk2 pages 10-15, nichols2009substratespecificityand pages 1-2). Furthermore, proteomic studies in LRRK2 knockout models have revealed coordinated alterations in pathways related to protein synthesis and degradation, highlighting roles for LRRK2 beyond the nervous system in maintaining cellular homeostasis (pellegrini2018proteomicanalysisreveals pages 1-1, herzig2011lrrk2proteinlevels pages 1-2). As a regulator of Rab GTPases, LRRK2’s kinase function is under active investigation both as a biomarker for disease progression and as a potential clinical endpoint in trials with selective kinase inhibitors (purlyte2018rab29activationof pages 17-17, verma2014erkedbylrrk2 pages 13-14).
