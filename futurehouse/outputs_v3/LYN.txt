1. Phylogeny  
Tyrosine‐protein kinase Lyn, also known by alternative names such as Lck/Yes‐related novel protein tyrosine kinase, p53Lyn, and p56Lyn, is a member of the Src family kinases (SFKs). The Src family constitutes a group of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases that are evolutionarily conserved across metazoans. Comprehensive analyses of the human protein kinase complement have demonstrated that SFKs, including Lyn, can be traced back to the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA), reflecting an ancient origin that predates the emergence of complex multicellular organisms (hanks1995theeukaryoticprotein pages 19-20). Evolutionary studies have revealed that Lyn clusters phylogenetically with other well‐characterized SFKs such as Src, Fyn, Yes, and Lck. These kinases share a highly conserved modular domain architecture – consisting of regulatory and catalytic elements – and a significant degree of amino acid sequence homology within their catalytic cores. This conservation extends particularly to the key regulatory features such as the C-terminal inhibitory tyrosine and the activation loop tyrosine, both of which are under strong evolutionary pressure to maintain precise regulatory mechanisms (hanks1995theeukaryoticprotein pages 21-21, ingley2008srcfamilykinases pages 1-2). Such phylogenetic analyses, based on genomic and proteomic studies, firmly place Lyn in the evolutionary core of tyrosine kinases. This core has been maintained throughout vertebrate evolution and is central to the regulation of signal transduction pathways that control cellular processes ranging from proliferation to immune responses (berndt2019crystalstructureof pages 6-7, ia2010structuralelementsand pages 1-6).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
Lyn functions as a classical protein tyrosine kinase by catalyzing the transfer of the γ-phosphate from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to specific tyrosine residues found on target protein substrates. The chemical reaction that Lyn catalyzes can be formally represented as follows:  
  ATP + protein-(L-tyrosine) = ADP + protein-(L-tyrosine-phosphate) + H⁺.  
This fundamental reaction is central to cellular signaling, as the phosphorylation event generates a phosphotyrosine residue that can serve as a docking site for downstream signaling molecules, thereby initiating or modulating complex intracellular signaling cascades (hanks1995theeukaryoticprotein pages 19-20, berndt2019crystalstructureof pages 4-6).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The catalytic activity of Lyn, similar to that observed in most protein kinases, requires the presence of divalent cations. In particular, Mg²⁺ ions are essential for kinase function, as they coordinate the binding of ATP within the kinase domain. The divalent cation participates in stabilizing the negative charges on the phosphate groups of ATP, effectively lowering the activation energy required for the phosphotransfer reaction and facilitating the enzymatic process (blouin2011catalyticspecificityof pages 1-2).

4. Substrate Specificity  
Lyn exhibits substrate specificity patterns characteristic of Src family kinases. Its kinase activity is directed toward tyrosine residues that reside within specific amino acid sequence contexts conducive to binding in the catalytic cleft. For example, Lyn targets substrates involved in immunoreceptor signaling pathways. In B cells, Lyn phosphorylates components of the B-cell receptor (BCR) complex such as CD79A and CD79B, as well as regulatory proteins including CD5, CD19, and CD22. Additionally, downstream signaling proteins, for instance BTK, SYK, and CBL, are recognized substrates for Lyn. High-throughput peptide substrate profiling and in vitro kinase assays have indicated that even though a single strict consensus sequence for Lyn has not been conclusively defined, substrates typically display surrounding residues with a combination of basic and hydrophobic characteristics that favor efficient engagement with Lyn’s catalytic domain (alobeidi1998proteintyrosinekinases pages 10-12, cowanjacob2006structuralbiologyof pages 2-4, jin2015tyrosinephosphorylationof pages 22-25, alobeidi1998proteintyrosinekinases pages 12-14). This substrate specificity underlies Lyn’s ability to regulate a diverse array of signaling cascades that control immune responses, survival, and cell adhesion.

5. Structure  
The three-dimensional structure of Lyn conforms to the canonical organization of Src family kinases, a design that supports both its catalytic function and its intricate regulatory mechanisms. At the extreme N-terminus, Lyn contains an SH4 domain, which is subject to N-myristoylation—a lipid modification that is critical for membrane association and proper subcellular targeting. Following the SH4 domain is a unique domain; although this region shows less sequence conservation among SFKs, it contributes to isoform-specific variations in regulation and may mediate particular protein–protein interactions. Lyn then possesses an SH3 domain, which recognizes and binds proline-rich motifs present in interacting proteins, and an SH2 domain that selectively binds phosphotyrosine-containing sequences, thereby enabling Lyn to both propagate and regulate signal transduction via intermolecular and intramolecular interactions (berndt2019crystalstructureof pages 2-4, ingley2008srcfamilykinases pages 1-2).  

Central to Lyn's function is the catalytic kinase domain (also known as the SH1 domain). This domain exhibits a bilobal structure, with a relatively small N-terminal lobe composed primarily of β-sheets and an αC helix, and a larger C-terminal lobe that is rich in α-helical elements. Critical features within this domain include the ATP-binding pocket, the highly conserved DFG motif (which marks the beginning of the activation loop), and key catalytic residues that directly participate in the phosphotransfer reaction. Upon phosphorylation of the activation loop tyrosine, a conformational rearrangement occurs that stabilizes the active state of Lyn; this rearrangement involves reorientation of the hydrophobic spine and the C-helix, which are essential for maintaining catalytic competency (cowanjacob2006structuralbiologyof pages 2-4, miyano2009structuralbasisfor pages 1-2). Recent crystallographic studies and high-resolution structures, including those focusing on the isolated SH3 domain, have further illuminated the atomic details underlying the regulation of Lyn’s catalytic activity and the conformational changes that occur upon activation (berndt2019crystalstructureof pages 4-6). These studies underscore the importance of the interdomain contacts among the SH4, SH3, SH2, and kinase domains in stabilizing either the inactive autoinhibited conformation or the active conformation of Lyn, depending on the cellular context.

6. Regulation  
Lyn is regulated by a multifaceted network of post-translational modifications, domain interactions, and lipid-mediated signals that together fine-tune its kinase activity. A principal regulatory mechanism involves phosphorylation events. Lyn is capable of autophosphorylation on a critical tyrosine residue located within its activation loop; this autophosphorylation event promotes a conformational shift toward an active state, thereby enhancing catalytic activity (donelladeana1998spontaneousautophosphorylationof pages 1-2). In contrast, phosphorylation of a conserved tyrosine residue in the C-terminal tail—typically mediated by the C-terminal Src kinase (CSK)—generates an autoinhibitory interaction through intramolecular engagement with the SH2 domain, resulting in suppression of kinase activity (donelladeana1998spontaneousautophosphorylationof pages 7-8, ingley2012functionsofthe pages 7-8).  

Beyond these primary phosphorylation switches, additional regulatory layers contribute to Lyn’s control. Its SH3 and SH2 domains not only mediate interactions with target proteins but also participate in intramolecular contacts that stabilize the inactive conformation. These domains can bind to specific proline-rich or phosphotyrosine motifs, respectively, which either maintain the autoinhibited state or facilitate release upon appropriate stimulus. Moreover, Lyn undergoes lipid modifications – notably N-myristoylation – which is essential for membrane targeting and proper localization within distinct cellular compartments such as the plasma membrane or the Golgi apparatus. Recent studies have further identified that Lyn is subject to N-myristoylation-dependent phosphorylation at serine residues. For instance, phosphorylation at Ser-13 by casein kinase 1γ (CK1γ) has been documented to occur in a Golgi-dependent manner during intracellular trafficking; such modifications add an additional level of spatial and temporal regulation to Lyn’s activity (kinoshitakikuta2020proteinnmyristoylationdependentphosphorylationof pages 1-2, kinoshitakikuta2020proteinnmyristoylationdependentphosphorylationof pages 10-12). These regulatory events collectively ensure that Lyn activity is precisely controlled in response to extracellular signals and intracellular feedback, enabling it to switch between active and inactive states as required by the physiological context.

7. Function  
Lyn functions as a central signaling mediator within many hematopoietic and immune cell types. In B cells, Lyn plays an indispensable dual role in both the initiation and the subsequent attenuation of B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling. Upon antigen engagement, Lyn phosphorylates key components of the BCR complex – such as CD79A and CD79B – as well as regulatory proteins including CD5, CD19, and CD22, thereby initiating downstream signaling pathways that govern B-cell differentiation, proliferation, survival, and apoptosis. This bimodal function is critical for maintaining immune self-tolerance and preventing aberrant immune responses (alobeidi1998proteintyrosinekinases pages 10-12, cowanjacob2006structuralbiologyof pages 2-4).

In addition to its role in B-cell signaling, Lyn participates in the modulation of a broad range of receptor-mediated pathways. It acts downstream of Fc receptors and Toll-like receptors (such as TLR2 and TLR4), thus contributing to the regulation of innate immune responses and the inflammatory reaction to bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Lyn also functions in hematopoietic progenitors and in mature myeloid cells—including dendritic cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils—where it transduces signals from cytokine and growth factor receptors (including EPOR, KIT, MPL, and the chemokine receptor CXCR4) to control processes such as cell proliferation, survival, migration, and degranulation (alobeidi1998proteintyrosinekinases pages 12-14, invergo2020predictionofsigned pages 1-3).

Downstream of these receptor events, Lyn regulates major intracellular signaling pathways, including the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT axis, the MAP kinase cascades (encompassing MEK1, ERK1/ERK2, and the JNK pathways), and the STAT5-mediated transcriptional pathway. Furthermore, in its role as a negative regulator, Lyn phosphorylates immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) on target proteins, thereby promoting the recruitment of inhibitory phosphatases such as SHP-1 (PTPN6), SHP-2 (PTPN11), and SHIP-1 (INPP5D). Through these actions, Lyn attenuates signaling and serves as a critical checkpoint in the regulation of immune responses, ensuring balanced and controlled cellular activation (donelladeana1998spontaneousautophosphorylationof pages 7-8, jin2015tyrosinephosphorylationof pages 22-25, ingley2012functionsofthe pages 1-2). Collectively, these diverse functions underscore Lyn’s role as a pivotal node in the signaling networks that control cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and apoptosis in various immune and hematopoietic lineages.

8. Other Comments  
Lyn kinase has garnered significant attention both as a regulator of normal immune cell function and as a potential therapeutic target in pathological conditions. Several small-molecule inhibitors originally developed to target Src family kinases have been shown to inhibit Lyn activity; among these, agents such as dasatinib and bosutinib—as described in recent pharmacological evaluations—are currently used in clinical settings to treat hematological malignancies and certain solid tumors where dysregulated SFK activity has been implicated (kim2019applicationofa pages 17-18). Moreover, aberrant Lyn signaling has been associated with a spectrum of disease states including various forms of leukemia, lymphoma, and autoimmune disorders. In some instances, mutations or alterations in Lyn’s autoinhibitory interactions, particularly those involving the SH2 and SH3 domains, result in chronic kinase activation and have been linked to oncogenic transformation (donelladeana1998spontaneousautophosphorylationof pages 3-4, miyano2009structuralbasisfor pages 1-2). Additionally, the discovery of regulatory mechanisms such as the N-myristoylation-dependent phosphorylation at Ser-13 by CK1γ at the Golgi highlights novel facets of Lyn’s spatial regulation that may offer new avenues for targeted therapeutic intervention (kinoshitakikuta2020proteinnmyristoylationdependentphosphorylationof pages 10-12). These multifactorial regulatory processes not only demonstrate the biological complexity of Lyn but also emphasize the need for continued research into selective inhibitors that can modulate its activity with higher specificity.
