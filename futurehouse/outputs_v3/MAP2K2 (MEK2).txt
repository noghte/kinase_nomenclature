1. Phylogeny  
MAP2K2, commonly known as MEK2, is a member of the dual‐specificity MAP kinase kinase family that falls within the CMGC group of kinases, a subclass of the broader kinome that includes CDKs, GSK3, and CLK kinases (akinleye2013mekandthe pages 1-2). MEK2 is conserved throughout eukaryotes and its orthologs are identifiable in a wide range of vertebrate species, indicating an ancient origin and broad evolutionary conservation (andrianova2023evolutionaryhistoryofa pages 4-6). Phylogenetic analyses have demonstrated that MEK2 and its paralog MEK1 share a common evolutionary ancestor, with gene duplication events in early vertebrate evolution leading to the divergence of these two kinases; MEK1 is considered the ancestral form while MEK2 represents a subsequent duplication and specialization (andrianova2023evolutionaryhistoryof pages 2-3). MEK2 is classified within the STE kinase group, specifically adapted for participating in the canonical Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade, and its sequence similarity with MEK1 is reflected in conserved kinase and regulatory domains (busca2016erk1anderk2 pages 19-19). In addition, detailed evolutionary reconstructions indicate that the divergence between MEK1 and MEK2 is accompanied by subtle differences in regulatory regions, which may be critical for context-dependent cellular signaling (martinvega2023navigatingtheerk12 pages 29-30). These relationships and conserved features establish MEK2 as an integral component of the MAP kinase cascade, forming part of an evolutionarily ancient module that is central to eukaryotic signal transduction (akinleye2013mekandthe pages 1-2).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
MEK2 catalyzes a reaction in which a phosphate group is transferred from ATP to both a threonine and a tyrosine residue that are present in the conserved Thr-Glu-Tyr (TEY) activation motif of its substrates, the ERK1 and ERK2 MAP kinases (akinleye2013mekandthe pages 2-4). This dual phosphorylation reaction converts ERK into its active form, enabling it to phosphorylate a wide range of downstream targets that regulate cellular proliferation, differentiation, and survival (akinleye2013mekandthe pages 8-9). The overall chemical reaction can be summarized as: ATP + [ERK] → ADP + [ERK-(Thr/Tyr)-phosphate] + H⁺, which is characteristic of many protein kinases that use ATP as a phosphate donor (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 2-4). This catalytic activity requires precise positioning of substrates and ATP within MEK2’s active site and depends on the sophisticated architecture of its kinase domain (lai2015investigationsofthe pages 55-60).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The catalytic mechanism of MEK2 is dependent on the binding of ATP as the phosphate donor, and this process typically requires the presence of divalent metal ions, such as Mg²⁺, which stabilize the ATP molecule within the active site (zhao2017insightsintothe pages 13-14). Mg²⁺ acts as a cofactor by coordinating with the phosphate groups of ATP, thereby facilitating the nucleophilic attack required for phosphoryl transfer (lai2015investigationsofthe pages 55-60). The requirement for ATP and Mg²⁺ is consistent with the general features of serine/threonine kinases and is crucial for proper substrate orientation and catalysis in the MAP kinase kinase family (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 2-4).

4. Substrate Specificity  
MEK2 exhibits a high degree of substrate specificity for the ERK family of MAP kinases, phosphorylating ERK1 and ERK2 selectively on a conserved TEY motif located in their activation loops (akinleye2013mekandthe pages 8-9). This specificity is dictated primarily by docking interactions between MEK2 and its ERK substrates, with MEK2 recognizing specific amino acid sequences and structural features that position the threonine and tyrosine residues for dual phosphorylation (busca2016erk1anderk2 pages 19-19). Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that MEK2’s substrate recognition is enhanced by the presence of docking domains, which facilitate the formation of transient complexes with ERK, ensuring that phosphorylation occurs efficiently under physiological conditions (martinvega2023navigatingtheerk12 pages 29-30, lai2015investigationsofthe pages 55-60).

5. Structure  
MEK2 has a modular structure characterized by a central kinase domain that comprises about 350–450 amino acids, which is responsible for its catalytic activity (akinleye2013mekandthe pages 1-2). The N-terminal region of MEK2 contains regulatory segments, including a docking (D) domain that is essential for substrate binding, as well as a nuclear export sequence that helps maintain the protein in the cytoplasm (martinvega2023navigatingtheerk12 pages 4-5). The catalytic core features a bi-lobed kinase domain typical of protein kinases, with the N-terminal lobe primarily composed of β-sheets and the C-terminal lobe containing helices, including the conserved C-helix that plays a critical role in ATP binding and catalysis (akinleye2013mekandthe pages 8-9, meister2013mitogenactivatedprotein(map) pages 4-6). The activation loop, situated between the DFG motif and the APE motif, is a key structural element that undergoes dual phosphorylation to switch MEK2 from an inactive to an active conformation; structural studies have elucidated that the activation loop can adopt a helical conformation that is critical for the binding of allosteric inhibitors (zhao2017insightsintothe pages 9-11). In addition, MEK2 features regions that mediate interactions with scaffolding proteins, notably the KSR1/KSR2 binding sites, which modulate its activity by affecting interactions with upstream regulators such as BRAF (akinleye2013mekandthe pages 1-2, martinvega2023navigatingtheerk12 pages 44-45). Collectively, these structural features, including the central kinase domain, regulatory segments, and docking interfaces, define the three-dimensional architecture that underpins MEK2’s catalytic and regulatory functions (lai2015investigationsofthe pages 49-55, meister2013mitogenactivatedprotein(map) pages 20-22).

6. Regulation  
The activity of MEK2 is tightly controlled by multiple regulatory mechanisms that involve phosphorylation, protein–protein interactions, and allosteric modulation. MEK2 is phosphorylated on two conserved serine/threonine residues in its activation loop by upstream RAF kinases, such as BRAF, which results in a conformational change that enhances its catalytic activity toward ERK substrate proteins (akinleye2013mekandthe pages 8-9, martinvega2023navigatingtheerk12 pages 30-32). Binding to scaffold proteins, including KSR1 and KSR2, plays an essential role in relieving autoinhibitory intramolecular interactions and promoting MEK2’s association with BRAF, thereby facilitating its activation (akinleye2013mekandthe pages 1-2, martinvega2023navigatingtheerk12 pages 44-45). In addition to phosphorylation, negative feedback mechanisms are known to regulate MEK2 activity; for instance, activated ERK can phosphorylate docking sites that reduce the interaction affinity between MEK2 and ERK, thus limiting the duration of the signal propagation (busca2016erk1anderk2 pages 19-19, akinleye2013mekandthe pages 8-9). Allosteric inhibitors have been developed that bind to a pocket adjacent to the ATP-binding site of MEK2, stabilizing an inactive conformation of the kinase without directly competing with ATP; these inhibitors exploit conformational flexibility within the activation loop and hydrophobic regions to achieve high specificity (zhao2017insightsintothe pages 7-9, katzengruber2023mkk4inhibitors—recentdevelopment pages 16-18). Thus, the regulation of MEK2 is accomplished via complex interactions involving upstream kinase activity, scaffold-mediated assembly of signaling complexes, and feedback inhibitory loops that collectively ensure precise control over ERK activation (lai2015investigationsofthe pages 55-60, shrestha2022theregulationof pages 31-34).

7. Function  
MEK2 functions as a central signal transducer within the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade, primarily responsible for the dual phosphorylation-dependent activation of the ERK1 and ERK2 MAP kinases (akinleye2013mekandthe pages 1-2, busca2016erk1anderk2 pages 19-19). The activation of ERK by MEK2 is essential for a multitude of cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, survival, and motility, which are fundamental to cell cycle progression and developmental processes (martinvega2023navigatingtheerk12 pages 29-30, akinleye2013mekandthe pages 8-9). In addition to its canonical role in ERK activation, MEK2 has been reported to influence BRAF activation through interactions mediated by KSR1 or KSR2, a regulatory mechanism that further implicates MEK2 in the fine tuning of mitogenic signals (Information, PubMed:29433126). MEK2 is expressed broadly in various tissues, and its deregulation or aberrant activation is frequently observed in several forms of cancer, where sustained ERK signaling contributes to uncontrolled cell growth and survival (akinleye2013mekandthe pages 6-8, martinvega2023navigatingtheerk12 pages 7-8). The enzyme’s substrate specificity for ERK ensures the fidelity of signal transduction from extracellular receptors to nuclear transcription factors, thereby influencing gene expression programs that underpin diverse cellular phenotypes (lai2015investigationsofthe pages 55-60, meister2013mitogenactivatedprotein(map) pages 20-22).

8. Other Comments  
A number of small molecule inhibitors have been developed that target MEK2, often in conjunction with MEK1, due to their high structural and functional similarity; such inhibitors include trametinib, selumetinib, and refametinib, which are in various stages of clinical evaluation for the treatment of cancers with hyperactivated Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling (akinleye2013mekandthe pages 6-8, katzengruber2023mkk4inhibitors—recentdevelopment pages 16-18). Although disease-associated mutations in MEK2 are relatively rare compared with those in upstream components such as Ras or BRAF, even low-frequency alterations in MEK2 have been linked to persistent ERK activation and may contribute to resistance mechanisms in targeted therapies (martinvega2023navigatingtheerk12 pages 29-30, lai2015investigationsofthe pages 55-60). Due to its central role in the oncogenic MAP kinase cascade, MEK2 continues to be an attractive target for the development of allosteric inhibitors that aim to reduce adverse effects by specifically stabilizing its inactive conformation (zhao2017insightsintothe pages 7-9, martinvega2023navigatingtheerk12 pages 44-45). In addition, the modulation of MEK2 activity through interactions with scaffold proteins such as KSR may offer novel strategies for tuning the downstream ERK output in both cancerous and developmental disorders (akinleye2013mekandthe pages 1-2, martinvega2023navigatingtheerk12 pages 30-32).
