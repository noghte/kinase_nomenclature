1. Phylogeny  
MAP3K3, also known as MEKK3, is a member of the mitogen‐activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) family that falls within the MEKK subfamily of serine/threonine kinases. It is evolutionarily conserved among eukaryotes, with clear orthologs in mammals and other vertebrates. Sequence comparisons indicate that MEKK3 shares approximately 90% identity in its kinase domain with MEKK2 while exhibiting around 65% identity with MEKK1, placing it in a distinct cluster within the MAP3K group that is responsible for integrating multiple stress and cytokine signals (kyriakis2001mammalianmitogenactivatedprotein pages 17-19, champion2004reassessingthemap3k pages 3-4). Its presence in the mammalian kinome is consistent with patterns observed across species in the conserved three‐tier MAP kinase cascade as described in classical phylogenetic analyses of eukaryotic kinases (widmann1999mitogenactivatedproteinkinase pages 1-2, al.)2002mitogenactivatedproteinkinase pages 4-6).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
MEKK3 catalyzes the phosphorylation of downstream signaling substrates by transferring the terminal phosphoryl group from ATP to specific serine or threonine residues on target proteins. The reaction it catalyzes can be represented as:  
  ATP + [protein]–OH → ADP + [protein]–OPO₃²⁻ + H⁺  
This activity is typical of serine/threonine protein kinases and underpins its role as an upstream activator in MAPK cascades (pearson2001mitogenactivatedprotein(map) pages 1-2, kyriakis2001mammalianmitogenactivatedprotein pages 17-19, widmann1999mitogenactivatedproteinkinase pages 1-2).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The kinase activity of MEKK3 is dependent on the binding of ATP as the phosphoryl donor and requires divalent metal ions, most notably Mg²⁺, to stabilize the interaction between the enzyme and ATP during catalysis. This cofactor dependency is standard for kinases within the MAP3K family (widmann1999mitogenactivatedproteinkinase pages 1-2, kyriakis2001mammalianmitogenactivatedprotein pages 17-19).

4. Substrate Specificity  
MEKK3 phosphorylates a range of MAP kinase kinase (MAP2K) substrates, including SEK1 (MKK4), MEK1, MKK3, MKK6, and specific isoforms of MKK7, thereby leading to the activation of downstream MAPKs such as the stress‐activated protein kinases (SAPKs), p38 family, ERKs, and the distinct ERK5 pathway. Although a strict linear consensus motif for MEKK3’s phosphorylation has not been defined, its substrate specificity is determined largely by the molecular conformation and interaction interfaces present in its target MAP2Ks—often involving docking interactions within their activation loops that contain the phosphorylatable serine/threonine residues (kyriakis2001mammalianmitogenactivatedprotein pages 17-19, johnson2005mapkkinasekinases pages 3-5, keshet2010themapkinase pages 4-5).

5. Structure  
MEKK3 is a relatively compact kinase with an approximate molecular weight of 71 kDa. Its overall structure is modular. The C-terminal region harbors the catalytic kinase domain, which contains the classical features of serine/threonine kinases, including:  
 – A glycine-rich loop essential for ATP binding.  
 – A catalytic loop that includes a conserved essential lysine residue critical for the phosphoryl transfer reaction.  
 – A C-helix, which plays an important role in the alignment of catalytic residues and the stabilization of the active conformation.  
 – An activation loop that is subject to regulatory phosphorylation on key residues such as Thr516, Ser520, and Ser526; these modifications are requisite for MEKK3’s full catalytic activation as they promote the optimal conformation for substrate binding and catalysis (kyriakis2001mammalianmitogenactivatedprotein pages 17-19, johnson2005mapkkinasekinases pages 6-7, sun2010phosphorylationofthr516 pages 1-2).  
In addition to the catalytic domain, the non-catalytic N-terminal region contains regulatory motifs including putative proline-rich segments and potential 14-3-3 protein binding sites. Furthermore, MEKK3 contains a PB1 (Phox and Bem1p) domain that mediates heterodimerization with MAP2K partners such as MKK5, an interaction that is important for channeling signals into specific pathways such as the ERK5 cascade (champion2004reassessingthemap3k pages 3-4, johnson2005mapkkinasekinases pages 6-7).

6. Regulation  
MEKK3 is regulated by multiple mechanisms that include post-translational modifications and interactions with other proteins. The phosphorylation of critical residues in the activation loop—specifically Thr516, Ser520, and Ser526—is essential for its catalytic activity and the propagation of downstream signaling events (sun2010phosphorylationofthr516 pages 1-2). These phosphorylation events modulate the conformational state of the activation loop, thereby facilitating substrate access and efficient phosphoryl transfer. In addition, the binding of regulatory scaffold proteins such as 14-3-3 has been demonstrated to influence MEKK3 localization and substrate interaction, effectively modulating the output of signal transduction cascades. Protein–protein interactions, including those mediated by the PB1 domain with MKK5, further contribute to its selective engagement with specific downstream pathways, particularly the ERK5 module. Upstream signals—such as those initiated by TNF-α, EGF, and oxidative stress—promote the phosphorylation and activation of MEKK3, while phosphatases and negative regulators counterbalance this activity by dephosphorylating key residues (kyriakis2001mammalianmitogenactivatedprotein pages 17-19, johnson2005mapkkinasekinases pages 6-7, keshet2010themapkinase pages 9-11).

7. Function  
MEKK3 functions as an essential signaling hub within the MAP kinase cascade. It mediates the activation of several MAPK pathways by phosphorylating MAP2K substrates, which in turn phosphorylate and activate downstream MAP kinases. Through this cascade, MEKK3 regulates the activity of transcription factors such as NF-κB, AP1, and DDIT3, thereby affecting gene expression associated with cellular stress responses, proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation (kyriakis2001mammalianmitogenactivatedprotein pages 17-19, pearson2001mitogenactivatedprotein(map) pages 20-21). It is involved in the activation of SAPKs, p38 MAPKs, ERKs, and especially the ERK5 pathway via its interaction with MKK5. MEKK3 thus plays critical roles in mediating responses to cytokines, inflammatory stimuli, and growth factors, and its proper regulation is essential for processes including immune cell activation and cardiovascular development (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8, pearson2001mitogenactivatedprotein(map) pages 6-8, pearson2001mitogenactivatedprotein(map) pages 31-31).

8. Other Comments  
Aberrant regulation or overexpression of MEKK3 has been associated with various pathophysiological conditions, including inflammatory diseases and cancer. Experimental inhibition of MEKK3 activity with broad-spectrum kinase inhibitors such as staurosporine has been observed, although potent and selective inhibitors specifically targeting MEKK3 have yet to be established (sun2010phosphorylationofthr516 pages 3-4, johnson2005mapkkinasekinases pages 5-6). Given its central position in multiple MAPK signaling pathways and its role in activating transcription regulators like NF-κB and AP1, MEKK3 is being investigated as a potential therapeutic target. Ongoing research focuses on elucidating its regulatory mechanisms and developing strategies to modulate its activity in disease contexts (champion2004reassessingthemap3k pages 6-6, guan2023functionsofmap3ks pages 13-14).
