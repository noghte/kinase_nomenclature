1. Phylogeny  
MAPK4 (also referred to as ERK4 or PRKM4) belongs to the atypical mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) subfamily. It is evolutionarily related to ERK3, with both atypical MAPKs sharing approximately 73% amino acid identity within their kinase domains. These kinases do not exhibit the classical Thr–X–Tyr activation loop motif seen in conventional MAPKs but instead contain a single phospho‐acceptor site within an S–E–G (Ser–Glu–Gly) motif. The presence and conservation of this atypical activation loop, together with a unique Ser–Pro–Arg motif present in subdomain VIII (replacing the typical A–P–E motif), situate MAPK4 in a distinct evolutionary branch among vertebrate MAPKs. MAPK4 and its close homolog ERK3 are restricted to vertebrates, and their gene structures along with their kinase domain features suggest that both proteins arose from a gene duplication event in a chordate ancestor (al2015identificationofnovela pages 19-23, coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 2-4, rousseau2009caractérisationdela pages 55-59).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
The catalytic reaction mediated by MAPK4 is the transfer of the γ‐phosphate from ATP to a hydroxyl group of specific serine/threonine residues on substrate proteins. This reaction can be represented as: ATP + [protein]–OH → ADP + [protein]–O–PO3^2– + H^+ (al2015identificationofnovel pages 19-23).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
MAPK4 requires divalent cations such as Mg^2+ for its catalytic activity, which is consistent with the cofactor needs of most serine/threonine kinases (al2015identificationofnovelc pages 19-23).

4. Substrate Specificity  
MAPK4 exhibits a narrow substrate specificity. The best characterized substrate is MAPK‐activated protein kinase 5 (MK5, also known as PRAK). Upon interaction, MAPK4 is phosphorylated at Ser-186 in its activation loop by upstream group I p21-activated kinases (PAKs); this phosphorylation event is required for the subsequent phosphorylation and activation of MK5. In addition, MAPK4 has been reported to phosphorylate microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2). However, no definitive consensus phosphorylation motif has been fully described for MAPK4 beyond its apparent preference for substrates like MK5, and no additional direct physiological substrates have been conclusively identified (al2015identificationofnovelb pages 19-23, almahi2013theregulationofa pages 19-23, meloche2010inhibitionofcdk1cyclin pages 296-300).

5. Structure  
MAPK4 is a 587 amino acid protein with an approximate molecular mass of 70 kDa. Its structure comprises a centrally located catalytic kinase domain near the N-terminus and a long C-terminal extension. The kinase domain contains an atypical activation loop that harbors a single phospho-acceptor site within the S–E–G motif, rather than the dual-specificity Thr–X–Tyr motif found in conventional MAPKs. Additionally, in subdomain VIII, MAPK4 features a distinct S–P–R motif in place of the usual A–P–E sequence. These structural deviations underlie the unique regulatory and substrate recognition properties of MAPK4. The protein mainly localizes to the cytoplasm, where its association with MK5 is crucial for the complex’s function. Structural models based on homology with ERK3 and related atypical MAPKs indicate that these unique motifs may influence the stabilization of the kinase domain’s C-terminal lobe and the overall arrangement of the hydrophobic spine and C-helix, thus affecting substrate binding (al2015identificationofnovela pages 19-23, coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 2-4, barbagallo2018exploringtheroles pages 15-19).

6. Regulation  
MAPK4 is regulated primarily by phosphorylation. Group I p21-activated kinases (PAK1/2/3) phosphorylate MAPK4 at Ser-186 within its activation loop; this modification is integral for achieving catalytic competence and stabilizing the interaction with substrate proteins such as MK5. Interaction with MK5 further promotes cytoplasmic accumulation, and studies show that genetic ablation of MAPK4 results in a significant reduction in MK5 activity. Additionally, reciprocal phosphorylation events have been observed, in which activated MK5 can, in turn, phosphorylate MAPK4. Despite these findings, the full extent of upstream activators, the involvement of additional post-translational modifications (such as ubiquitination), and the precise allosteric regulation of MAPK4 remain to be fully elucidated (almahi2013theregulationof pages 19-23, meloche2010inhibitionofcdk1cyclin pages 296-300, rousseau2009caractérisationdela pages 55-59).

7. Function  
MAPK4 functions as an atypical signaling kinase and is implicated in the regulation of downstream effectors primarily via its substrate MK5. The phosphorylation and activation of MK5 are critical steps that may influence cellular processes such as cell motility, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and potentially cell cycle entry. Although the precise physiological roles of MAPK4 remain unclear, evidence points to its involvement in complex phosphorylation cascades wherein the MAPK4–MK5 complex modulates signal transduction pathways that can affect cell behavior. The available data also suggest that the MAPK4–MK5 signaling module may have roles in neurobehavioral processes, as indicated by altered behavioral phenotypes in knockout studies; however, MAPK4-specific physiological substrates besides MK5 are yet to be definitively characterized (al2015identificationofnovel pages 19-23, almahi2013theregulationofa pages 19-23, meloche2010inhibitionofcdk1cyclin pages 296-300).

8. Other Comments  
Currently, there are no specific inhibitors that have been definitively shown to selectively target MAPK4 in clinical settings. The atypical nature and distinct regulatory mechanisms of MAPK4 compared to classical MAPKs have contributed to the limited identification of additional physiological substrates and downstream effectors. Moreover, while MAPK4 has been implicated by similarity in promoting cell cycle entry, its exact role in disease states, including potential associations with cancer or neurological disorders, has yet to be firmly established in the peer-reviewed literature. The available studies highlight a need for further investigation into the biochemical properties and cellular functions of MAPK4, including identification of novel substrates and elucidation of any disease-associated mutations (al2015identificationofnovelc pages 19-23, rousseau2009caractérisationdela pages 90-94).
