1. Phylogeny  
MAPK9, commonly known as JNK2, is a member of the c‐Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) subgroup within the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family. JNK2 is one of three paralogous isoforms present in vertebrates, the others being JNK1 (MAPK8) and JNK3 (MAPK10). These kinases share over 85% sequence identity and arose via gene duplication events during early vertebrate evolution from a single ancestral JNK gene observed in nonvertebrate animals (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 2-3, zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 6-7). In contrast to JNK3, which exhibits a more restricted tissue distribution (primarily in brain, heart, and testes), JNK2 is ubiquitously expressed across numerous tissue types, supporting its role in general stress-response pathways (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 1-3, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 20-22). Alternative splicing events engender multiple isoforms of JNK2, which differ in their C-terminal domain lengths (the p46 and p54 isoforms) and are modulated by tissue-specific splicing regulators such as those of the Nova family, thereby providing an additional layer of evolutionary and functional diversification (zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 7-8). JNK2 is categorized as a Stress-Activated Protein Kinase (SAPK) within the CMGC group of serine/threonine kinases, which also includes cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), and casein kinase 2. This evolutionary context illustrates that MAPK9/JNK2 is part of a conserved signaling system extending from yeast to humans, an ancestral pathway that has been modified by gene duplication events to mediate distinct physiological processes in multicellular organisms (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 2-3, zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 6-7).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
MAPK9/JNK2 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that catalyzes the transfer of the γ-phosphate group from ATP to hydroxyl groups in serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins. The general chemical reaction it facilitates is: ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 1-3, zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 1-1).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The catalytic activity of MAPK9/JNK2 is dependent upon the presence of divalent metal ions, with magnesium (Mg²⁺) serving as the essential cofactor. Mg²⁺ ions coordinate with ATP in the active site and are critical for the proper binding of ATP and the subsequent phosphoryl transfer reaction (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 1-3).

4. Substrate Specificity  
MAPK9/JNK2 exhibits substrate specificity typical of stress-activated serine/threonine kinases. It phosphorylates protein substrates having a consensus phosphorylation motif consisting of a phosphorylatable serine or threonine residue immediately followed by a proline residue (S/T-P), a feature that designates it as a proline-directed kinase (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 3-5, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 31-32). Noteworthy substrates include transcription factors such as c-Jun and ATF2, which incorporate docking motifs (D-domains) that facilitate direct binding to the kinase. These docking interactions are critical for selecting appropriate substrates and ensuring efficient phosphorylation, thereby modulating transcriptional activity within the AP-1 complex (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 14-15, zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 10-10). In addition, MAPK9/JNK2 phosphorylates several mitochondrial and cytoplasmic proteins implicated in apoptosis, such as members of the Bcl-2 family (Bcl2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1) as well as pro-apoptotic regulators (Bad, Bim, Bax), and proteins involved in cell signaling cross-talk including adaptor proteins like IRS1/2 that are phosphorylated near motifs recognized by 14-3-3 proteins (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 28-29, zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 24-25). Recent large-scale analyses of substrate specificities for the human serine/threonine kinome have confirmed a strong preference for a S/T-P motif, further supporting the notion that MAPK9/JNK2 has an intrinsic selectivity for substrates that contain a proline immediately C-terminal to the phosphorylatable residue (cicenas2017jnkp38erk pages 1-3).

5. Structure  
Structurally, MAPK9/JNK2 is organized as a two-lobed kinase domain typical of protein kinases, consisting of an N-terminal lobe primarily composed of beta-sheets and a larger, predominantly alpha-helical C-terminal lobe. The active site is situated in the cleft between these lobes and includes the conserved activation loop containing the Thr-Pro-Tyr (TPY) motif, whose dual phosphorylation is essential for full catalytic activation (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 3-5, heo2004structuralbasisfor pages 1-2). Within the kinase domain, several structural features are preserved: a glycine-rich loop that assists in ATP binding, a catalytic loop harboring essential residues for phosphoryl transfer, and a C-helix that plays a key role in orchestrating the positioning of ATP and substrates (zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 8-10).

In addition, MAPK9/JNK2 possesses distinct docking sites located on its surface such as the common docking (CD) region and the hydrophobic docking groove. These docking regions facilitate the binding of substrates and regulatory proteins (e.g., scaffold proteins like JNK-interacting protein-1, JIP1) by specifically recognizing short linear docking motifs (D-motifs) in their interacting partners (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 14-15, zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 10-13). Alternative splicing leads to the generation of isoforms with slight alterations in their C-terminal regions, most notably the shorter p46 and longer p54 variants. The inclusion of alternative exons (e.g., exon 6a versus 6b) modifies the C-terminal extension and may impact regulatory interactions and subcellular localization (zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 7-8, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 4-6). While high-resolution crystal structures exist for other JNK isoforms (e.g., JNK1 and JNK3 complexed with peptides from JIP1), the structural organization of MAPK9/JNK2 can be inferred to follow a similar conserved architecture with additional isoform-specific features that modulate substrate binding and activation (heo2004structuralbasisfor pages 1-2, zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 8-10).

6. Regulation  
Regulation of MAPK9/JNK2 is complex and occurs at multiple levels. The primary activation mechanism is via dual phosphorylation of the TPY motif located in its activation loop. This phosphorylation is mediated by two MAP kinase kinases (MAP2Ks), MKK4 and MKK7, which are distinct in their substrate preferences: MKK4 preferentially phosphorylates the tyrosine residue, while MKK7 targets the threonine residue (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 3-5, fleming2000synergisticactivationof pages 1-2, cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 5-6). Such coordinated phosphorylation events ensure a robust and synergistic activation of MAPK9/JNK2 in response to extracellular stress stimuli, including pro-inflammatory cytokines, ultraviolet irradiation, osmotic shock, and oxidative stress (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 12-14, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 1-2).

Scaffold proteins play a pivotal role in regulating MAPK9/JNK2 by assembling signaling complexes that include upstream kinases, MAP2Ks, and the kinase itself. For example, the JNK-interacting protein-1 (JIP1) binds to JNK2 through a well-defined docking motif, thereby facilitating substrate recruitment, spatial organization, and even nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking of the kinase (willoughby2003thejnkinteractingprotein1 pages 1-1, heo2004structuralbasisfor pages 1-2). Such scaffold-mediated assembly ensures precise signal propagation and prevents aberrant activation of MAPK9/JNK2 in non-stressed conditions.

In addition to phosphorylation by upstream kinases, MAPK9/JNK2 activity is modulated by dephosphorylation through dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs or MKPs) such as MKP1, MKP5, and others, which act as negative regulators to attenuate the signaling cascade (zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 31-32, zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 31-31). Feedback mechanisms are also operative; for instance, MAPK9/JNK2 may phosphorylate adapter proteins and even components of the upstream kinase complexes, thereby creating regulatory loops that fine-tune the overall kinase activity (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 14-15, zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 16-17).

Post-translational modifications beyond phosphorylation also contribute to the regulation of MAPK9/JNK2. Specific phosphorylation events on substrates and within the kinase itself determine its interactions with binding partners and its subcellular localization. Auto-phosphorylation of certain splice variants in vitro has also been observed, though its physiological relevance remains under investigation (zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 16-17, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 30-30). Overall, the regulation of MAPK9/JNK2 is multifaceted, involving precise kinase-phosphatase equilibria, scaffold-mediated assembly, and feedback loops that altogether ensure an appropriate cellular response to stress signals (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 12-14, zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 1-2).

7. Function  
MAPK9/JNK2 plays a central role in transducing extracellular stress signals to intracellular responses, thereby affecting numerous cellular processes. It is activated by a variety of stimuli including pro-inflammatory cytokines, physical stresses (e.g., UV irradiation, heat shock), osmotic changes, and oxidative stress (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 1-3, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 1-2). One of its best characterized functions is the phosphorylation of transcription factors such as c-Jun and ATF2, which in turn modulate AP-1-dependent gene expression. This activity regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and programmed cell death, as well as gene expression programs vital for stress responses (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 14-15, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 31-32).

MAPK9/JNK2 also has key roles in the regulation of apoptosis. Under conditions of oxidative or ribotoxic stress, it phosphorylates factors including TP53 (p53) and YAP1, thereby promoting cell death pathways. In addition, phosphorylation of mitochondrial proteins and members of the Bcl-2 family by MAPK9/JNK2 participates in the regulation of mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 20-22, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 18-19). Such phosphorylation events can inactivate anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Mcl-1) or activate pro-apoptotic factors (e.g., Bax and Bim), ultimately influencing the fate of cells exposed to cellular stress (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 12-14, zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 24-25).

In immune cells, particularly T-cells, MAPK9/JNK2, together with MAPK8/JNK1, is required for the proper differentiation of T-helper cells into Th1 cells and for modulating T-cell receptor-induced signaling cascades (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 3-5, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 1-2). The activation cascade involves the adaptors CARMA1 and BCL10 as well as MAP3K7/TAK1, culminating in the regulation of downstream transcription factors such as c-Jun (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 14-15, rigourously supported by consensus in multiple reviews).

Moreover, MAPK9/JNK2 is implicated in the regulation of epithelial integrity. It participates in the osmotic stress-induced disruption of epithelial tight junctions, which is critical for maintaining barrier function under stressful conditions (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 12-14, cicenas2017jnkp38erk pages 1-3). Additionally, when activated, MAPK9/JNK2 contributes to the degradation of β-catenin, thereby acting as a negative regulator of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway—a pathway vital for cell fate determination and tissue homeostasis (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 12-14, zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 42-43).

MAPK9/JNK2 has been reported to influence circadian rhythms as well by phosphorylating components of the circadian clock complex, including the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 17-17, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 32-33). By modulating these transcription factors, MAPK9/JNK2 helps regulate the timing of gene expression in accordance with the circadian cycle.

In neuronal cells, MAPK9/JNK2 contributes to neurite growth and axonal transport. It is involved in the regulation of proteins that mediate vesicular trafficking and microtubule dynamics, which are essential for proper neuronal development and function. The involvement of scaffold proteins such as JIP1 in this process further underscores the importance of the spatial regulation of JNK activity in neurons (zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 31-32, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 30-31).

Collectively, the multifunctional roles of MAPK9/JNK2 in stress responses, apoptosis, immune signaling, epithelial integrity, circadian regulation, and neuronal function highlight its central place in cellular signal transduction pathways and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 17-17, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 2-3).

8. Other Comments  
Several small-molecule inhibitors have been designed to target the JNK family, including MAPK9/JNK2. Notable among these is SP600125, an ATP-competitive inhibitor that has been widely used in experimental settings to elucidate the roles of JNK isoforms in cell signaling, although it is not entirely isoform-specific (cicenas2017jnkp38erk pages 3-5, heo2004structuralbasisfor pages 1-2). Other inhibitors, such as CEP-1347, have been investigated in clinical contexts, particularly in relation to neurodegenerative diseases, due to their ability to modulate JNK-mediated apoptotic pathways (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 12-14, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 30-31). 

Disease associations of MAPK9/JNK2 are broad. Dysregulation of JNK signaling is implicated in various pathological conditions including neurodegeneration, cancer, metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance, and inflammatory diseases. In the context of cancer, aberrant JNK2 activity can modulate apoptosis and cell proliferation, influencing tumor development and response to chemotherapeutic agents (cicenas2017jnkp38erk pages 1-3, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 27-28). In T-cells, its role in mediating the differentiation into Th1 cells links MAPK9/JNK2 to immune responses, while in epithelial cells, its involvement in tight junction disruption ties it to pathological conditions associated with barrier dysfunction (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 14-15, zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 42-43).

Furthermore, emerging evidence indicates that MAPK9/JNK2 modulates circadian rhythm pathways by phosphorylating CLOCK-BMAL1, suggesting a potential impact on sleep disorders and metabolic syndrome (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 17-17, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 32-33). The phosphorylation of substrates such as the RNA polymerase I-specific transcription initiation factor RRN3 implicates MAPK9/JNK2 in the regulation of ribosomal RNA synthesis under stress conditions (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 17-17, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 20-22).

Additional regulation through protein–protein interactions with scaffold proteins such as JIP1 further underscores the adaptability of MAPK9/JNK2 signaling in both physiological and pathological contexts (willoughby2003thejnkinteractingprotein1 pages 1-1, zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 7-8). As research continues, new inhibitors with improved specificity and potency are anticipated, and emerging genetic studies may pinpoint mutations in MAPK9/JNK2 that contribute to disease phenotypes, making it a promising target for therapeutic intervention.
