1. Phylogeny  
Megakaryocyte‐associated tyrosine‐protein kinase (MATK), also known as CSK homologous kinase, HYL, or CTK, belongs to the non‐receptor tyrosine kinase family and is evolutionarily related to C‐terminal Src kinase (CSK). MATK shares conserved sequence and structural features with CSK; however, unlike the ubiquitously expressed CSK, MATK exhibits a restricted phylogenetic distribution, with orthologs identified predominantly in vertebrates—especially in hematopoietic cells and the brain (chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 1-2, grgurevich1997thecsklikeproteins pages 1-3). The kinase is situated within an evolutionary branch derived from the core signaling kinases present in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor, and its close relationship with CSK places it in a group of kinases that have co‐evolved with Src family kinases (grgurevich1997thecsklikeproteins pages 13-13). Comparative analyses indicate that while the catalytic domain of MATK is highly conserved with other members of the CSK family, its regulatory domains—most notably the SH2 domain—show adaptations that contribute to its tissue‐specific functions.

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
MATK catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to the phenolic hydroxyl group of specific tyrosine residues on its substrates. In particular, it phosphorylates the conserved C‐terminal regulatory tyrosine residue of Src family kinases, a modification that induces a closed, inactive conformation in these substrates. The chemical reaction can be summarized as follows:  
  ATP + [protein]-Tyr → ADP + [protein]-pTyr + H⁺  
This reaction results in the conversion of the unphosphorylated tyrosine residue to a phosphorylated state, thereby downregulating the catalytic activity of Src family members (chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 1-2).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The kinase activity of MATK is dependent on divalent metal ion cofactors, with Mg²⁺ being essential for its catalytic function. As is typical for protein kinases, Mg²⁺ facilitates the proper binding of ATP within the active site and stabilizes the transition state during phosphoryl transfer (ia2010structuralelementsand pages 1-6).

4. Substrate Specificity  
MATK exhibits a dual mechanism of substrate regulation that involves both catalytic phosphorylation and non‐catalytic inhibitory binding. Its primary catalytic activity is directed toward the phosphorylation of a conserved C‐terminal tyrosine residue present in Src family kinases, a residue that, when phosphorylated, serves as a negative regulatory site. Studies have indicated that while MATK (like CSK) can recognize an optimal phosphorylation sequence exemplified by motifs such as EEIYFFF, the strict physiological substrate specificity relies on both local amino acid sequence determinants and distal docking interactions contributed by its SH2 and SH3 domains (chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 8-9, ia2010structuralelementsand pages 25-29). In addition to its catalytic function, MATK can form stable complexes with active Src family kinases, thereby inhibiting their activity via a non‐catalytic mechanism that is independent of tyrosine phosphorylation (chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 8-9).

5. Structure  
MATK is organized into an N-terminal region followed by modular domains that are characteristic of the CSK family. It contains an SH3 domain and an SH2 domain, which are followed by a central catalytic (kinase) domain. The SH2 domain mediates interactions with phosphorylated tyrosine motifs on transmembrane and adaptor proteins, thereby recruiting MATK to specific subcellular locales such as the plasma membrane, where Src family kinases are concentrated (chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 1-2, chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 3-5).  
Within the kinase domain, conserved motifs such as the glycine-rich loop, the catalytic loop, and the activation loop are present. Although MATK lacks some regulatory features present in Src family kinases—such as autophosphorylation sites and a C-terminal inhibitory tyrosine—its catalytic core is highly similar to that of CSK, including the presence of a hydrophobic spine that is critical for positioning ATP and substrate for efficient phosphorylation (ia2010structuralelementsand pages 6-10, grgurevich1997thecsklikeproteins pages 1-3). Additionally, structural studies of the CSK family have revealed that the regulatory SH2 and SH3 domains can engage in inter-domain interactions with the kinase domain to modulate activity. Such interactions are thought to also occur in MATK, contributing to both its catalytic activation and substrate specificity (chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 2-3, ia2010structuralelementsand pages 50-52). No unique structural elements exclusive to MATK have been reported; instead, its regulation appears to mirror that of other CSK homologs with tissue-specific expression.

6. Regulation  
Regulatory mechanisms for MATK involve several layers of control. Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, play a central role in modulating its activity. MATK phosphorylates the C-terminal regulatory tyrosine on Src family kinases, thereby switching these kinases to an inactive conformation (chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 1-2). In addition, MATK itself can be regulated via phosphorylation events mediated by upstream kinases such as protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates residues (for example, Ser-364 in CSK, with similar mechanisms presumed for MATK) to stimulate full catalytic activity (ia2010structuralelementsand pages 21-25, chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 6-8).  
Beyond direct phosphorylation, MATK regulation also involves subcellular localization. Its SH2 domain directs MATK to plasma membrane microdomains by binding to phosphotyrosine residues on adaptor proteins such as Cbp/PAG. In hematopoietic cells and platelets, this localization is critical; for instance, upon thrombin stimulation in platelets, MATK translocates from the soluble cytosolic fraction to the cytoskeletal compartment, which correlates with a release of inhibition on Src family kinase Lyn (hirao1997translocationofthe pages 1-2, hirao1997translocationofthe pages 9-10).  
Furthermore, MATK can inhibit Src family kinases not only by phosphorylating them but also through forming stable, non-catalytic complexes. This dual regulatory mechanism ensures efficient negative control over Src family kinase signaling, particularly in contexts where precise modulation of signal transduction is required (chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 8-9).

7. Function  
MATK plays a significant role in the signal transduction pathways of hematopoietic cells and the brain. Its primary function is the negative regulation of Src family kinases through phosphorylation of their C-terminal regulatory tyrosine residues. This phosphorylation event locks Src family kinases in a closed, inactive conformation, thereby modulating downstream proliferative and differentiation signals (chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 1-2, chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 11-12).  
In hematopoietic cells, MATK is expressed predominantly in megakaryocytes, T lymphocytes, and natural killer cells, where it contributes to the control of cell proliferation and differentiation. For example, by suppressing the activity of Src family kinases such as Lck and Lyn, MATK plays an inhibitory role in T-cell proliferation and may help maintain the quiescent state in normal immune cells (kim2004differentialexpressionof pages 8-9, grgurevich1997thecsklikeproteins pages 9-11).  
In the central nervous system, MATK is expressed in neuronal populations where it is implicated in the regulation of neurite outgrowth, axonal guidance, and neuronal differentiation through controlling local Src family kinase activity (chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 5-6). This dual functionality—spanning hematopoietic regulation to neuronal signal transduction—underscores the importance of MATK in maintaining cellular homeostasis across diverse tissues.

8. Other Comments  
MATK’s unique dual mechanism of inhibition, involving both catalytic phosphorylation of Src family kinases and non-catalytic binding that sequesters active kinases, has generated interest in its potential as a tumor suppressor. In colorectal cancer, for example, epigenetic silencing of MATK has been observed, suggesting that loss of its inhibitory control over Src kinases may contribute to malignant transformation (chueh2021cskhomologouskinase(chkmatk) pages 1-4).  
While there are currently no specific inhibitors developed solely against MATK, its structural and regulatory similarities to CSK imply that insights gained from CSK inhibitor studies may be applicable. The development of selective modulators that can enhance MATK activity or mimic its inhibitory interaction with Src family members holds potential for therapeutic intervention in cancers characterized by aberrant Src signaling (chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 8-9, boubeva2011understandingtyrosinekinase pages 45-49).  
Additionally, the restricted expression of MATK in specific hematopoietic and neuronal cell types renders it a candidate for targeted studies in disorders associated with immune dysregulation and neurological abnormalities.
