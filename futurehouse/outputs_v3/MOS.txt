1. Phylogeny  
Proto‐oncogene serine/threonine‐protein kinase Mos (c‐Mos, MOS; UniProt P00540) is a highly conserved kinase expressed in the oocytes of diverse vertebrate species, including amphibians such as Xenopus laevis and mammals such as mice and humans (cao2020positivefeedbackstimulation pages 1-2, kishimoto2018mpfbasedmeioticcell pages 12-13). It is classified within the serine/threonine kinase family and occupies an evolutionarily ancient branch of the kinome—a group of regulators of the mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade—that appears to have diverged early in metazoan evolution (charlesworth2006musashiregulatesthe pages 1-2, kishimoto2018mpfbasedmeioticcell pages 12-13).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
Mos catalyzes the transfer of the γ‐phosphate group from ATP to specific serine or threonine hydroxyl groups on target proteins, thereby converting ATP to ADP and generating phosphorylated protein substrates (cao2020positivefeedbackstimulation pages 1-2, russo2009kickedbymos pages 13-13).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The kinase activity of Mos is dependent on the presence of ATP and requires divalent cations—most notably Mg²⁺—which coordinate ATP binding in the catalytic cleft and enable efficient phosphate transfer (qian2001thepololikekinase pages 7-8, cao2020positivefeedbackstimulation pages 1-2).

4. Substrate Specificity  
Mos exhibits substrate specificity toward regulatory proteins that are integral to the MAPK cascade and cell cycle control. In particular, it phosphorylates key components such as MAP kinase kinase 1 (MEK1) to initiate downstream activation of ERK1/2, and it has been implicated in the phosphorylation of proteins such as CPEB1 and Xe‐Wee1 in oocyte models (cao2020positivefeedbackstimulation pages 1-2, murakami1999mospositivelyregulates pages 2-3). Although a strict consensus motif is not explicitly defined in the available literature, Mos is known to target serine/threonine residues within substrates that regulate meiotic progression (murakami1999mospositivelyregulates pages 2-3).

5. Structure  
Mos is characterized by a central catalytic kinase domain that harbors well‐conserved motifs—including VAIK, HLD, and DFG—which are essential for ATP binding and the catalytic transfer of phosphate groups (stroehlein2016analysesofcompact pages 7-7). Structural models indicate that Mos adopts a canonical kinase fold featuring an activation loop, a C‐helix, and a hydrophobic spine that collectively contribute to its enzymatic activity (russo2009kickedbymos pages 3-4). In addition to its catalytic core, Mos possesses less conserved regulatory regions that may influence its localization and protein–protein interactions during oocyte maturation (stroehlein2016analysesofcompact pages 7-8).

6. Regulation  
Mos is stringently regulated at both the translational and post‐translational levels. Its mRNA is stored in oocytes in a dormant state until hormonal cues—such as progesterone stimulation—trigger cytoplasmic polyadenylation via cis‐acting elements (CPEs and PREs) in the 3′‐UTR. This translational activation is mediated by RNA‐binding proteins such as CPEB1 and Musashi, which enable timely MOS protein synthesis during oocyte maturation (cao2020positivefeedbackstimulation pages 4-6, charlesworth2006musashiregulatesthe pages 5-5). Post‐translationally, Mos undergoes phosphorylation at defined residues (for example, at Ser-3 and Ser-105), which modulate its catalytic efficiency and stability. These phosphorylation events are part of positive feedback loops involving downstream MAPK and maturation promoting factor (MPF) activities that ultimately safeguard the steady accumulation of MOS during meiosis while ensuring its rapid degradation following fertilization (russo2009kickedbymos pages 2-3, murakami1999mospositivelyregulates pages 11-12).

7. Function  
Mos functions as an essential activator of the MAPK/ERK signaling cascade during oocyte maturation. Following germinal vesicle breakdown, de novo synthesis of MOS protein drives the phosphorylation of MEK1; this event propagates through the cascade to activate ERK1/2, ultimately leading to proper meiotic spindle assembly, chromosomal segregation, and the maintenance of metaphase II arrest (cao2020positivefeedbackstimulation pages 1-2, kalab1996activationofp90rsk pages 6-8). In Xenopus oocytes, Mos additionally mediates regulatory crosstalk with cell cycle components, such as by modulating Xe‐Wee1 activity, thereby contributing to the precise timing of cell cycle transitions during early embryonic development (murakami1999mospositivelyregulates pages 2-3, kishimoto2018mpfbasedmeioticcell pages 20-21).

8. Other Comments  
To date, no small‐molecule inhibitors have been reported that specifically target Mos; rather, its signaling can be indirectly modulated through inhibitors of upstream or downstream kinases in the MAPK pathway, such as the MEK inhibitor U0126 or the CDK inhibitor roscovitine (russo2009kickedbymos pages 11-12, qian2001thepololikekinase pages 3-5). Abnormal regulation of Mos has been associated with defects in oocyte maturation and has been implicated in certain forms of female infertility—as observed in conditions involving mutated PATL2 that lead to decreased MOS translation (cao2021therecurrentmutation pages 8-10). Furthermore, owing to its proto–oncogene status, dysregulation of Mos in somatic cells may contribute to oncogenic transformation, although detailed disease associations remain to be fully elucidated (russo2009kickedbymos pages 11-12, murakami1999mospositivelyregulates pages 2-3).
