1. Phylogeny  
NEK1 is a member of the NIMA‐related kinase (NEK) family, a group that comprises 11 distinct serine/threonine kinases in mammals and has its origin in fungi, notably being originally characterized from Aspergillus nidulans as NIMA (Never in Mitosis A) (bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 7-9, meirelles2014“stopne(c) pages 2-3). Its kinase domain is highly conserved and can be traced back to common eukaryotic ancestors, reflecting evolutionary relationships that extend from yeasts to mammals and underscoring the critical role played by these kinases in cell cycle regulation and DNA maintenance (bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 3-7, nguyen2023nekfamilyreview pages 2-4). Phylogenetic analyses based on conserved catalytic regions reveal that NEK1 clusters with other related family members—particularly those sharing similar domain architectures and regulatory mechanisms—which implies that the structural and functional attributes of NEK1 have been preserved throughout evolution (meirelles2014“stopne(c) pages 2-3, bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 7-9). Its conservation across diverse species and the presence of orthologs in lower eukaryotes underscore NEK1’s importance within a broader evolutionary framework dedicated to the regulation of mitosis, DNA damage response, and ciliary function (nguyen2023nekfamilyreview pages 2-4).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
NEK1 catalyzes the transfer of the γ-phosphate from ATP to specific hydroxyl groups on target proteins, thereby phosphorylating serine and threonine residues and, under certain conditions, tyrosine residues as well (Information, bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 7-9). This phosphorylation reaction can be represented chemically as:  
  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺  
This biochemical reaction underlies NEK1’s ability to modulate the activity, localization, and interactions of its substrates, which include proteins involved in checkpoint control, DNA repair, and mitochondrial integrity (Information, bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 7-9).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The catalytic activity of NEK1 depends on divalent metal ions, with Mg²⁺ being the requisite cofactor to coordinate the transfer of the γ-phosphate from ATP to its substrate proteins. Mg²⁺ facilitates proper ATP binding within the catalytic site and thereby supports the enzyme’s kinase function in phosphorylating serine, threonine, and potentially tyrosine residues (bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 7-9).

4. Substrate Specificity  
NEK1 is well known for its ability to phosphorylate serine and threonine residues, and emerging evidence indicates that under certain cellular conditions, it can also exhibit tyrosine kinase activity (Information, meirelles2014“stopne(c) pages 4-6). While the precise consensus substrate motif has not been completely determined, studies indicate that NEK1’s substrate specificity is governed by its conserved catalytic domain and regulatory sequences. For example, NEK1 has been implicated in the phosphorylation of mitochondrial VDAC1—a modification that limits mitochondrial cell death following DNA damage—and may similarly target other substrates involved in the DNA damage response, such as proteins required for homologous recombination repair (Information, melohanchuk2017nek1kinasedomain pages 9-11). Furthermore, its function in the regulation of meiosis and cilium assembly suggests that the kinase recognizes substrates important for these processes, although the detailed amino acid preferences within its substrate motifs remain to be fully elucidated (nguyen2023nekfamilyreview pages 14-16, meirelles2014“stopne(c) pages 3-4).

5. Structure  
NEK1 is organized into discrete domains that together form a modular structure typical of many regulatory kinases. Its N-terminal region harbors the catalytic kinase domain, which usually spans approximately 260 amino acids and is responsible for its enzymatic activity through conserved motifs such as the DFG (Asp-Phe-Gly) motif, the catalytic loop, and the activation segment (bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 7-9, meirelles2014“stopne(c) pages 2-3). Structural studies—employing techniques such as X-ray crystallography and computational modeling via tools like Phyre2 and AlphaFold—have provided a three-dimensional view of this catalytic region, revealing an arrangement that includes a bilobal kinase fold, an αC-helix that aligns the active site, a hydrophobic spine, and a flexible activation loop whose phosphorylation is essential for full activation (melohanchuk2017nek1kinasedomain pages 11-12, bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 1-2).  

Beyond the kinase domain, NEK1 contains a large noncatalytic central region and an extended C-terminal tail that features multiple coiled-coil domains, PEST sequences, and a putative nuclear export signal (bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 7-9, meirelles2014“stopne(c) pages 2-3). The coiled-coil motifs present within the C-terminal region are believed to mediate interactions with other proteins and possibly promote dimerization or oligomerization, which can have a regulatory impact on NEK1’s activity (meirelles2014“stopne(c) pages 3-4, bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 7-9). Additionally, dynamic phosphorylation of residues in the C-terminal section—such as serines S649, S666, and S683—has been observed, suggesting that these modifications regulate the conformational state and substrate binding affinity of NEK1 (melohanchuk2017nek1kinasedomain pages 9-11). Collectively, the combination of a highly conserved catalytic module with extensive regulatory elements enables NEK1 to integrate multiple cellular signals and modulate its activity in a context-dependent manner (bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 7-9, melohanchuk2017nek1kinasedomain pages 11-12).

6. Regulation  
The regulatory mechanisms controlling NEK1 activity are multifactorial and critically important for its roles in DNA damage response, cell cycle progression, and cilium assembly. A central regulatory mechanism involves the phosphorylation of NEK1 by upstream kinases. In particular, human Tousled-like kinase 1 (TLK1) phosphorylates NEK1 at specific residues—such as threonine 141 within the kinase domain—thereby modulating its catalytic activity during the DNA damage response (melohanchuk2017nek1kinasedomain pages 9-11, singh2017identificationofthe pages 16-21). This phosphorylation event is an essential step in the activation of NEK1, enabling it to subsequently phosphorylate downstream substrates involved in maintaining genomic integrity.  

In addition to TLK1-mediated phosphorylation, NEK1 undergoes autophosphorylation and dynamic phosphorylation within its regulatory C-terminal region. Residues in proximity to its coiled-coil motifs, including S649, S666, and S683, exhibit changes in phosphorylation status in response to DNA-damaging agents such as cisplatin, suggesting that these modifications trigger conformational changes that enable NEK1 to shift from an inactive, possibly dimeric state, to an active monomeric conformation that is competent for substrate binding (melohanchuk2017nek1kinasedomain pages 9-11, meirelles2014“stopne(c) pages 3-4). Furthermore, NEK1’s subcellular localization is subject to regulation; under normal conditions, it predominantly resides in the cytoplasm and at centrosomes, but following exposure to DNA damage it translocates to nuclear foci marked by γ-H2AX, reflecting its active involvement in checkpoint control and repair machinery (bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 7-9, pavan2021onbrokenne(c)ks pages 5-7). These layers of control—from upstream phosphorylation by TLK1 to auto- and intermolecular phosphorylation events—allow NEK1 activity to be tightly coordinated with the cellular status, ensuring that its kinase activity is engaged only under conditions that require enhanced DNA repair, spindle assembly regulation, or cilium maintenance (patil2013roleofnek1 pages 8-15, pavan2021onbrokenne(c)ks pages 5-7).

7. Function  
NEK1 plays a pivotal role in several interrelated cellular processes that collectively contribute to the maintenance of genomic stability and proper cell function. Its most extensively characterized function lies in the DNA damage response (DDR), where NEK1 acts as a critical checkpoint kinase. In response to genotoxic stress, NEK1 contributes to the activation of DNA repair pathways by phosphorylating substrates that are integral to the repair process, such as proteins involved in homologous recombination (bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 7-9, patil2013roleofnek1 pages 103-110). One key substrate is VDAC1, a protein located in the mitochondrial outer membrane; phosphorylation of VDAC1 by NEK1 has been shown to limit mitochondrial cell death, thereby preserving cell viability in conditions where DNA integrity is compromised (Information, quinaseUnknownyearisadoracarolinabetim pages 47-49).  

In addition to its role in DDR, NEK1 is implicated in cell cycle regulation through its involvement in checkpoint control and replication stress management. The kinase is activated in response to DNA damage and participates in promoting cell cycle arrest, which allows sufficient time for repair processes to take place before the cell transitions into subsequent phases of the cell cycle (bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 7-9, pavan2021onbrokenne(c)ks pages 5-7). Its contribution extends to the proper progression of both mitosis and meiosis; high expression levels in meiotic germ cells and observations regarding defects in cohesin removal during spermatogenesis suggest a role for NEK1 in ensuring the fidelity of meiotic chromosome segregation (nguyen2023nekfamilyreview pages 14-16, bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 7-9).  

Moreover, NEK1 is essential for ciliogenesis. It has been reported to regulate primary cilium assembly and stabilization—processes that are essential for proper cellular signaling and homeostasis—by phosphorylating proteins that are involved in both the structural integrity and functional dynamics of ciliary organelles (meirelles2014“stopne(c) pages 3-4, nguyen2023nekfamilyreview pages 2-4). Given that primary cilia serve as important hubs for signal transduction and that disruptions in ciliary function are linked to a spectrum of ciliopathies, NEK1’s regulatory activity in this domain is of significant biological importance.  

Collectively, the multifunctionality of NEK1—spanning roles in DNA damage checkpoint control, regulation of mitochondrial function, execution of proper mitotic and meiotic progression, and maintenance of ciliary architecture—positions it as a central node within cellular signaling networks that guard against genomic instability and aberrant cell division (bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 7-9, patil2013roleofnek1 pages 103-110, nguyen2023nekfamilyreview pages 14-16, pavan2021onbrokenne(c)ks pages 5-7, meirelles2014“stopne(c) pages 4-6).

8. Other Comments  
NEK1 is of considerable clinical interest because of its involvement in several pathological conditions. Aberrant NEK1 function has been associated with a spectrum of human diseases, including polycystic kidney disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), skeletal dysplasias, and various cancers (bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 25-26, nguyen2023nekfamilyreview pages 10-11). Its dual kinase activity—phosphorylating not only serine and threonine residues but also displaying tyrosine kinase activity under particular conditions—adds complexity to its regulatory profile and expands the range of potential substrates (Information, singh2017identificationofthe pages 16-21). Although specific inhibitors targeting NEK1 have not yet been widely reported in the high-impact literature, the detailed elucidation of its kinase domain structure, including the active site configuration and regulatory motifs, is expected to facilitate future drug discovery efforts aimed at modulating its activity in disease settings characterized by defective DNA repair and cell cycle dysregulation (melohanchuk2017nek1kinasedomain pages 9-11, nguyen2023nekfamilyreview pages 10-11). Furthermore, the therapeutic potential of NEK1 inhibition is underscored by its central role in the coordination of mitochondrial integrity during DNA damage, where phosphorylation of substrates such as VDAC1 serves to limit apoptosis (quinaseUnknownyearisadoracarolinabetim pages 47-49). The integration of NEK1 within broader signaling cascades that include upstream regulators like TLK1 and downstream effectors involved in cellular checkpoint control makes it a promising candidate for targeted therapies in oncology and in disorders related to ciliary dysfunction (bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 7-9, pavan2021onbrokenne(c)ks pages 5-7).
