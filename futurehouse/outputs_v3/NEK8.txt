1. Phylogeny  
NEK8 is a member of the NIMA‐related kinase (NEK) family, a group of serine/threonine protein kinases originally identified in Aspergillus nidulans that has expanded considerably in metazoans. In humans, NEK8 is encoded as a 703–amino acid protein and is evolutionarily conserved among higher eukaryotes, with orthologs documented in rodent and primate species. Its presence in a wide range of species underscores its preservation over evolutionary time and its importance in fundamental cellular processes. Comparative sequence analyses, as reported in studies on the NEK family, place NEK8 together with other kinases that regulate centrosomal and ciliary functions. In particular, phylogenetic grouping based on the kinase domain and regulatory regions indicates that NEK8 is closely related to kinases such as NEK9, with which it shares similarities in domain architecture and functional roles. This evolutionary relationship supports its inclusion in an established subgroup of NIMA‐related kinases that participate in cell cycle regulation and primary cilium biogenesis (moniz2011nekfamilyof pages 1-3, bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 3-7, roig2025nek8animafamily pages 1-2).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
NEK8 functions as a serine/threonine protein kinase that catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to specific serine or threonine residues on its substrate proteins. The chemical reaction that NEK8 mediates can be summarized as follows:  
  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺.  
This phosphorylation reaction is essential for modulating the activity, interactions, or localization of target proteins and is consistent with the general catalytic mechanism employed by serine/threonine kinases in signal transduction pathways (holland2002purificationcloningand pages 1-1, holland2002purificationcloningand pages 5-6, fry2017mitoticregulationby pages 10-11).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The enzymatic activity of NEK8 is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ion cofactors that facilitate ATP binding and stabilize the transition state during phosphotransfer. Biochemical studies have demonstrated that NEK8 exhibits a marked preference for Mn²⁺ ions over Mg²⁺. In experimental kinase assays, optimal NEK8 activity was observed in the presence of MnCl₂ at concentrations in the low-millimolar range, which is consistent with the behavior of other NIMA-related kinases that utilize divalent cations to coordinate ATP binding (holland2002purificationcloningand pages 6-7, holland2002purificationcloningand pages 8-9).

4. Substrate Specificity  
NEK8 displays substrate specificity characteristic of serine/threonine kinases within the NEK family. Initial biochemical investigations using synthetic peptide substrates derived from proteins such as β-casein revealed that NEK8 phosphorylates serine residues within sequences that contain clusters of basic and hydrophobic residues. For instance, assays employing a peptide with the sequence RRR-HLPPLLLQSWMHQPHQ demonstrated that NEK8 is capable of phosphorylating its target serine in a robust and reproducible manner (holland2002purificationcloningand pages 3-5, holland2002purificationcloningand pages 5-6). Such studies also identified the candidate substrate Bicd2, a coiled-coil protein that associates with NEK8 in vitro, further supporting the notion that NEK8 preferentially recognizes substrates with defined basic-hydrophobic motifs. Although detailed consensus motifs have been delineated in broader kinome profiling studies, the in vitro data for NEK8 support a substrate preference for serine/threonine residues embedded in sequences enriched in basic (e.g., arginine) and hydrophobic (e.g., leucine) amino acids. This substrate specificity is integral to NEK8’s capacity to modulate signaling pathways related to ciliary function and DNA repair, and it aligns with its classification as a threonine-preferring kinase based on in vitro phosphorylation assays (holland2002purificationcloningand pages 3-5, holland2002purificationcloningand pages 5-6).

5. Structure  
NEK8 is characterized by a modular structure that includes discrete functional domains essential for its catalytic activity and subcellular localization. Its N-terminal region contains a canonical serine/threonine kinase domain that houses critical structural features found in most eukaryotic protein kinases, such as the glycine-rich loop (P-loop), the catalytic loop, the activation segment (which includes the activation loop and the DFG motif), and a conserved C-helix. These features collectively contribute to ATP binding, substrate orientation, and catalytic efficiency (holland2002purificationcloningand pages 3-5, fry2017mitoticregulationby pages 10-11).

Following the kinase domain, NEK8 includes a non-catalytic RCC1-like domain. This domain is predicted to adopt a seven-bladed β-propeller architecture—a hallmark of RCC1 proteins—that is instrumental in mediating protein–protein interactions and ensuring proper subcellular localization. The RCC1-like domain is also thought to contribute to NEK8’s regulatory functions by providing a docking platform for interaction partners involved in centrosomal and ciliary signaling (roig2025nek8animafamily pages 2-4, zalli2012thenek8protein pages 1-2).

Additionally, NEK8 harbors a C-terminal coiled-coil domain that is implicated in oligomerization and may facilitate the binding of substrates such as Bicd2. The presence of this coiled-coil motif suggests a role in mediating intermolecular interactions, which could be critical for the assembly of larger ciliary complexes or for the coordination of signaling events during cell cycle progression (holland2002purificationcloningand pages 5-6, bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 31-33).

Although no high-resolution crystal structure of NEK8 has been reported, recent computational models based on AlphaFold and related prediction tools have provided insights into its three-dimensional organization. These models depict the kinase domain in the typical bilobal arrangement with the active site cleft positioned between the N- and C-lobes, while the RCC1-like domain appears as a well-defined propeller structure that is distinct from the catalytic module (bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 17-18, roig2025nek8animafamily pages 2-4).

6. Regulation  
NEK8 is subject to multiple layers of regulation that ensure its activity is appropriately modulated during the cell cycle and in response to extracellular signals. Autophosphorylation represents a primary regulatory mechanism for NEK8; the kinase is capable of phosphorylating itself, an event that has been associated with changes in electrophoretic mobility and the formation of stable multimeric complexes. Such autophosphorylation events are believed to occur within the activation loop and contribute to the full activation of the kinase (holland2002purificationcloningand pages 6-7, holland2002purificationcloningand pages 9-11).

In addition to autophosphorylation, NEK8 undergoes regulated proteolytic degradation during the process of ciliogenesis. Studies have indicated that NEK8 is both activated and subsequently targeted for degradation as cells initiate cilium formation, a process that is critical for the timely removal of signaling proteins and the remodeling of the cell’s structural framework (zalli2012thenek8protein pages 1-2, bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 18-20).

Protein–protein interactions also play a pivotal role in modulating NEK8 activity. For example, the interaction between NEK8 and ANKS6 facilitates the proper targeting of NEK8 to the ciliary inversin (INV) compartment and appears to enhance its kinase activity. Such interactions are essential for ensuring that NEK8 is localized to specific subcellular domains where it can exert its functions in ciliary maintenance and centrosome regulation (bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 31-33).

Regulatory pathways controlled by oxygen tension further influence NEK8. The expression of NEK8 is regulated by hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF-1α and HIF-2α) and the von Hippel–Lindau protein (pVHL), suggesting that NEK8 functions are modulated in response to cellular oxygen levels—a regulatory mechanism that is particularly relevant in kidney epithelial cells (bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 18-20). Collectively, these regulatory mechanisms—autophosphorylation, proteasomal degradation during ciliogenesis, and specific protein–protein interactions—are critical for ensuring that NEK8 activity is tightly coordinated with the dynamic requirements of the cell cycle and ciliary assembly (holland2002purificationcloningand pages 9-11, zalli2012thenek8protein pages 1-2).

7. Function  
NEK8 performs a multifunctional role in cellular physiology, with activities spanning the maintenance of renal tubular integrity, the regulation of ciliary biogenesis, and the preservation of genomic stability. In kidney epithelial cells, NEK8 is essential for maintaining the integrity of renal tubules. It is thought to regulate local cytoskeletal organization, thereby ensuring proper cell shape and adhesion, which are prerequisites for normal tubular function. Disruption in NEK8 activity has been linked to cystic kidney diseases, such as nephronophthisis and polycystic kidney disease, underscoring its functional importance in renal organogenesis (moniz2011nekfamilyof pages 5-6, zalli2012thenek8protein pages 1-2).

NEK8 also localizes prominently to the primary cilium—a microtubule-based organelle that serves as a signaling hub for various developmental and homeostatic pathways. In this context, NEK8 is involved in the regulation of ciliary assembly and length by targeting proteins required for ciliary function. Its role in ciliogenesis is supported by observations that mutations in NEK8 lead to aberrant localization of ciliary proteins and consequent ciliary dysfunction (bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 17-18, roig2025nek8animafamily pages 1-2).

Beyond its roles in ciliary maintenance and renal tubular architecture, NEK8 has been implicated in the DNA damage response. It participates in the regulation of replication fork protection and homologous recombination repair by modulating the formation of RAD51 foci in response to replication stress. This function is critical for preserving genome integrity under conditions of DNA damage and replication stress, thereby preventing the accumulation of double-strand breaks and maintaining cell viability (abeyta2016ahighthroughput pages 51-56, pavan2021onbrokenne(c)ks pages 13-15).

Additionally, NEK8 has been associated with the regulation of the Hippo signaling pathway. Alterations in NEK8 expression or activity have been linked to dysregulation of Hippo signaling, which in turn may contribute to developmental anomalies and tumorigenesis. For example, mutations in NEK8 have been observed in models of organ dysplasia, and overexpression of NEK8 has been documented in primary human breast carcinomas, suggesting a role in oncogenic processes (bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 17-18, frank2013mutationsinnek8 pages 6-6).

Through these diverse functions, NEK8 acts as an integrator of signaling pathways that coordinate cell proliferation, differentiation, and structural organization. Its roles in ciliary biogenesis and DNA damage repair link it to both developmental processes and cellular stress responses, making it a critical player in maintaining cellular homeostasis in tissues such as the kidney (moniz2011nekfamilyof pages 3-4, pavan2021onbrokenne(c)ks pages 20-21).

8. Other Comments  
Currently, there are no specific inhibitors reported for NEK8, and its pharmacological targeting remains an area of ongoing investigation. The absence of selective inhibitors has, to date, limited detailed studies on the potential therapeutic modulation of NEK8 activity. In terms of disease associations, mutations in NEK8—especially those affecting its RCC1-like domain—are linked to ciliopathies such as nephronophthisis and polycystic kidney disease, conditions characterized by disrupted ciliary function and renal cyst formation. In addition, altered expression levels of NEK8 have been observed in the context of cancer, most notably in primary human breast carcinomas, where its dysregulation may contribute to aberrant organogenesis and tumor progression (zalli2012thenek8protein pages 1-2, frank2013mutationsinnek8 pages 6-6, bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 17-18). These observations underscore the dual importance of NEK8 in both developmental processes and in disease states associated with impaired ciliary dynamics and genomic instability.
