1. Phylogeny  
NEK9, also known as Nercc1, KIAA1995, and NimA‐related kinase 8, is a member of the NIMA‐related kinase (NEK) family – a group of serine/threonine kinases originally defined by the fungal NIMA kinase. In humans, the NEK family comprises 11 members (NEK1–NEK11), and NEK9 is evolutionarily conserved across eukaryotes, with orthologs found in all vertebrates. Its placement in the kinome is based on a highly conserved catalytic domain that traces back to the ancestral NIMA kinase, forming part of the core set of regulators of cell cycle progression distributed from yeast to man (bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 3-7, moniz2011nekfamilyof pages 1-3).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
NEK9 functions as a serine/threonine kinase by catalyzing the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP onto specific serine or threonine residues in target proteins. The generalized chemical reaction it mediates can be represented as:  
  ATP + [protein]–OH → ADP + [protein]–O–PO₃²⁻ + H⁺  
This reaction results in the post-translational modification of target proteins by phosphorylation, a process fundamental for regulating protein activity during the cell cycle (fry2017mitoticregulationby pages 6-8, domingo2012studyofthe pages 40-45).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The catalytic activity of NEK9 is dependent on divalent metal ions, with Mg²⁺ serving as an essential cofactor. In its kinase reaction, ATP functions as the phosphate donor, and the presence of Mg²⁺ is required to properly coordinate ATP binding and facilitate phosphoryl transfer – a requirement characteristic of serine/threonine kinases (bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 18-20, delgado2018identificationofnovel pages 47-53).

4. Substrate Specificity  
NEK9 exhibits substrate specificity that encompasses a variety of proteins. It phosphorylates several substrates; prominent among these are histones – for example, NEK9 phosphorylates histone H3 on serine and threonine residues—as well as beta‐casein on serine residues. In addition, NEK9 targets proteins such as myelin basic protein and BICD2. Importantly, NEK9 phosphorylates downstream kinases NEK6 and NEK7; phosphorylation of these kinases occurs on specific serine residues within their activation loops, a modification that releases their intrinsic autoinhibitory motifs (Tyr-108 in NEK6 and Tyr-97 in NEK7) and thereby stimulates their catalytic activity (bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 20-21, fry2017mitoticregulationby pages 6-8).

5. Structure  
NEK9 is a 120 kDa protein comprising 979 amino acids organized in a modular fashion. The N-terminal region contains a catalytic kinase domain spanning approximately residues 53 to 308; this domain bears the conserved features of serine/threonine kinases, including the ATP-binding pocket, the activation loop, and key catalytic residues necessary for phosphoryl transfer. Central to the protein is an RCC1-like domain (encompassing residues roughly 347 to 726) that is implicated in protein–protein interactions and provides an autoinhibitory function; while it shares structural similarity to the canonical RCC1, it does not function as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor. The C-terminal region of NEK9 (residues approximately 891 to 940) contains a coiled-coil domain that is critical for homodimerization and subsequent autophosphorylation-mediated activation. Additional regulatory motifs are distributed throughout the protein, including PEST sequences, SH3‐binding PXXP motifs, nuclear localization signals, and an LC8-binding motif, all of which contribute to subcellular localization and temporal regulation of kinase activity during the cell cycle (roig2002nercc1amammalian pages 1-2, bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 29-30, bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 33-34).

6. Regulation  
NEK9 activity is tightly regulated by phosphorylation and protein–protein interactions. During interphase, NEK9 is largely inactive and is distributed diffusely throughout the cytoplasm. With the onset of mitosis, NEK9 is activated via a multi-step phosphorylation process. Initial phosphorylation events are mediated by CDK1, which prime NEK9 for binding by Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1). Plk1 then phosphorylates NEK9 at critical residues – notably within the activation loop (including Thr210) – triggering autophosphorylation that fully activates the kinase. Once activated, NEK9 phosphorylates downstream targets such as NEK6 and NEK7; this phosphorylation serves to relieve the autoinhibitory effects exerted by specific tyrosine residues (Tyr-108 in NEK6 and Tyr-97 in NEK7), thereby promoting their activation and facilitating their functions in mitotic spindle assembly. Furthermore, interactions with regulatory proteins such as LC8 modulate NEK9’s oligomerization state and activity, integrating signals from the cell cycle machinery to ensure proper timing of mitotic events (bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 14-15, richards2009anautoinhibitorytyrosine pages 11-11, roig2002nercc1amammalian pages 1-2).

7. Function  
NEK9 functions as a pleiotropic regulator of mitotic progression. It plays a critical role in the coordination of key mitotic processes, including spindle assembly, centrosome separation, and accurate chromosome segregation. NEK9 directly phosphorylates substrates such as histone H3, thus contributing to chromatin condensation, and beta-casein, impacting signaling pathways involved in cell cycle regulation. Moreover, by phosphorylating and activating downstream kinases NEK6 and NEK7, NEK9 exerts control over mitotic spindle dynamics and microtubule organization; such activation is essential for the proper progression from G1/S into mitosis and for ensuring cytokinesis fidelity. Expression studies have indicated that NEK9 is broadly expressed in human tissues, with elevated levels in the brain, heart, liver, kidney, skeletal muscle, and testis – a pattern that underscores its importance in both rapidly dividing cells and in differentiated tissue functions. NEK9’s interactions with additional factors involved in nuclear transport and transcription regulation further extend its role beyond mere mitotic control, positioning it as a critical integrator in cell cycle–dependent signaling pathways (bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 29-30, bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 33-34, roig2002nercc1amammalian pages 1-2, moniz2011nekfamilyof pages 8-8, pavan2021onbrokenne(c)ks pages 20-21).

8. Other Comments  
Dysregulation of NEK9 has been linked to significant mitotic defects, including errors in spindle assembly and chromosome missegregation, which may lead to aneuploidy. In addition, mutations in NEK9 have been associated with skeletal dysplasias and defects in ciliogenesis. In the context of tumorigenesis, overexpression or aberrant activation of NEK9 has been observed in various cancer types, and pharmacological inhibition – for example, with dabrafenib – has been demonstrated to reduce proliferation in BRAF- and Ras-mutant cancers. Owing to its central role at the apex of a kinase cascade that regulates downstream effectors such as NEK6 and NEK7, NEK9 represents a potential therapeutic target for correcting mitotic errors and targeting rapidly proliferating cancer cells. Its interactions with proteins such as Ran GTPase, LC8, and components of the microtubule–nucleation machinery further underscore its multifunctional role in maintaining genomic integrity and proper cell cycle progression (crisostomo2021characterizationofnek9 pages 35-40, bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 21-22, pavan2021onbrokenne(c)ks pages 20-21, nguyen2023nekfamilyreview pages 17-18).
