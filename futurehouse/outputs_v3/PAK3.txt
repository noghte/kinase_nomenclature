1. Phylogeny  
Serine/threonine‐protein kinase PAK3 (Uniprot ID O75914), also known by alternative names Beta‐PAK, Oligophrenin‑3, and p21‑activated kinase 3, is a member of the p21‑activated kinase (PAK) family. Within the PAK family, kinases are categorized into two distinct groups. PAK3 is classified among the Group I PAKs, which comprise PAK1, PAK2, and PAK3, in contrast to Group II kinases (PAK4, PAK5, and PAK6) (rudolph2015inhibitorsofp21activated pages 1-2). Group I PAKs are evolutionarily conserved across vertebrate species and share high sequence identity within their catalytic domains, an attribute that underscores the derivation of these kinases from a common ancestral protein kinase. Orthologs of PAK3 have been identified in all mammalian species, with a notable enrichment in neuronal tissues. This phylogenetic conservation is reflected in the structural organization of the kinase, where the regulatory and catalytic domains exhibit significant sequence conservation when compared with other Group I family members (dummler2009pakproteinkinases pages 1-3, rane2014p21activatedkinases pages 1-2). The evolutionary relationships among Group I PAKs indicate that they lie within a core set of kinases that emerged early in eukaryotic evolution, and their divergence has been marked by adaptations that confer tissue‐specific functions, such as the pronounced role of PAK3 in the central nervous system (rudolph2015inhibitorsofp21activated pages 1-2, dummler2009pakproteinkinases pages 1-3).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
PAK3 catalyzes the phosphorylation of serine/threonine residues on specific substrate proteins. The chemical reaction involves the transfer of the gamma-phosphate from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the hydroxyl group present on the serine or threonine residue of the substrate. The reaction can be summarized as follows:  
  ATP + [protein]–OH → ADP + [protein]–O‑phosphate + H⁺  
This phosphoryl transfer reaction is the hallmark of serine/threonine kinases and is essential for modulating the activity, localization, and interaction of target proteins (dummler2009pakproteinkinases pages 1-3, rane2014p21activatedkinases pages 5-6).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The catalytic activity of PAK3 depends on the presence of divalent metal ion cofactors that assist in ATP binding and the stabilization of the transition state during phosphoryl transfer. In this regard, magnesium ions (Mg²⁺) are essential cofactors for PAK3 activity. Mg²⁺ binds to ATP, thereby facilitating the proper positioning of the nucleotide within the catalytic cleft of the kinase and enabling efficient transfer of the phosphate group to the substrate (liu2010p21activatedkinase3 pages 8-9, rudolph2015inhibitorsofp21activated pages 1-2).

4. Substrate Specificity  
PAK3 exhibits substrate specificity that is characteristic of Group I PAKs. Although a defined consensus motif for PAK3 has not been universally established, its substrate preference is inferred from its high degree of homology with PAK1 and PAK2. PAK3 phosphorylates serine and threonine residues on proteins that play pivotal roles in cytoskeletal organization, cell migration, and signal transduction. Notable substrate targets include mitogen-activated protein kinase 4 (MAPK4) and MAPK6, whose phosphorylation results in the activation of downstream target MAPKAPK5—a regulator implicated in F-actin polymerization and cell migration. Additionally, PAK3 phosphorylates TNNI3 (troponin I), a modification that modulates calcium sensitivity and influences the relaxation kinetics of thin myofilaments, thereby impacting muscle contractile function. Furthermore, the kinase has been implicated in the phosphorylation of other regulatory proteins involved in synaptic function and dendritic spine morphogenesis; however, the exact consensus substrate motif remains to be fully delineated (rane2014p21activatedkinases pages 6-7, thevenot2011p21activatedkinase3 pages 1-2, dummler2009pakproteinkinases pages 3-4, rudolph2015inhibitorsofp21activated pages 1-2).

5. Structure  
PAK3 is organized into a modular architecture that comprises an N-terminal regulatory region and a C-terminal catalytic (kinase) domain. The N-terminal segment of PAK3 contains a p21-binding domain (PBD), also known as the CRIB (Cdc42/Rac interactive binding) domain, which is critical for the direct interaction with activated small GTPases (CDC42 and RAC1). Overlapping with this domain is an autoinhibitory domain (AID) that maintains the kinase in a quiescent state by interacting in trans with the catalytic domain in the absence of activating inputs. Multiple proline-rich sequences within the regulatory region also mediate interactions with SH3 domain–containing adaptor proteins such as Nck2; these interactions are particularly relevant to the regulation of synaptic transmission in neuronal cells (thevenot2011p21activatedkinase3 pages 12-12, rane2014p21activatedkinases pages 2-5).  
The C-terminal catalytic domain of PAK3 exhibits the typical bilobal structure observed in serine/threonine kinases. It includes the conserved ATP-binding pocket, an activation loop (T-loop) that contains key phosphorylation sites required for full catalytic activity, and motifs such as the DFG sequence and the hydrophobic spine, which are essential for maintaining the active conformation. Structural studies performed on homologous kinases, particularly PAK1, have provided detailed insights into this arrangement. In the inactive state, PAK3 is believed to form homodimers that are stabilized by interactions between the regulatory and catalytic regions; upon binding of GTP-bound CDC42 or RAC1 to the PBD/CRIB domain, a conformational reorganization occurs that disrupts the dimer interface and permits autophosphorylation within the activation loop, thereby producing an active monomeric enzyme (rudolph2015inhibitorsofp21activated pages 1-2, wang2022groupipaks pages 1-3, rane2014p21activatedkinases pages 2-5).  
A unique structural feature of PAK3 is the presence of an N-terminal sequence that is more divergent relative to other Group I PAK isoforms; this divergence may underlie its specific functional roles in neuronal tissues. High-resolution structural models, including those generated by AlphaFold and inferred from crystallographic data on related kinases, support a conserved overall fold for the kinase domain while highlighting subtle differences in regulatory regions that contribute to isoform-specific interactions (rane2014p21activatedkinases pages 2-5, wang2022groupipaks pages 1-3).

6. Regulation  
The regulation of PAK3 activity is orchestrated primarily through its interaction with small GTPases and the resulting conformational changes that govern its catalytic state. In its basal (inactive) form, the autoinhibitory domain (AID) of PAK3 engages the kinase domain to prevent unwarranted activity. Upon stimulation, GTP-bound CDC42 or RAC1 binds to the CRIB domain, which is contiguous with the AID; this binding event relieves the autoinhibitory constraint and triggers a conformational change that facilitates autophosphorylation on several serine and threonine residues, particularly within the activation loop. The autophosphorylation locks PAK3 in a catalytically active state (rane2014p21activatedkinases pages 2-5, thevenot2011p21activatedkinase3 pages 1-2).  
Alongside GTPase-mediated activation, regulatory interactions with adaptor proteins further modulate PAK3 activity. For instance, the preferential binding of the Nck2 adaptor protein to a unique region in the PAK3 N-terminus plays an important role in regulating synaptic transmission in hippocampal neurons. Notably, this interaction appears to occur irrespective of the activation state of the kinase and is maintained even in the presence of certain disease-associated mutations, as reported by protein interaction studies (thevenot2011p21activatedkinase3 pages 12-12).  
Other regulatory inputs, such as additional phosphorylation events by upstream kinases or the binding of regulatory lipids, have been documented for Group I PAKs, though the extent to which these mechanisms operate specifically on PAK3 remains less thoroughly characterized. Nonetheless, the core regulatory scheme—whereby relief of autoinhibition coupled with subsequent autophosphorylation amplifies kinase activity—remains central to PAK3 regulation (rane2014p21activatedkinases pages 6-7, rudolph2015inhibitorsofp21activated pages 1-2).

7. Function  
PAK3 fulfills diverse biological roles owing to its function as a serine/threonine kinase that acts downstream of CDC42 and RAC1. It plays a significant role in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics, which is fundamental for a variety of cellular processes including cell migration, adhesion, and cell cycle progression. One of the most prominent functions of PAK3 is in the nervous system, where it is critically involved in dendritic spine morphogenesis and the formation of excitatory synapses in hippocampal neurons. In these cells, the kinase activity of PAK3 is required for the proper establishment and plasticity of synaptic connections, and mutations that impair its function are associated with cognitive deficits and nonsyndromic X-linked mental retardation (thevenot2011p21activatedkinase3 pages 1-2, dummler2009pakproteinkinases pages 6-7).  
Beyond its role in neuronal morphogenesis, PAK3 phosphorylates components of signaling cascades that regulate actin polymerization. Specifically, PAK3 phosphorylates MAPK4 and MAPK6, leading to the activation of MAPKAPK5. This kinase cascade ultimately modulates F‑actin polymerization, thereby impacting cell migration and the dynamic remodeling of the cytoskeleton—a process that is essential not only in neurons but also in various cell types engaged in motile activity (rane2014p21activatedkinases pages 6-7, rudolph2015inhibitorsofp21activated pages 1-2).  
Additionally, PAK3 phosphorylates troponin I (TNNI3), an event that alters the calcium sensitivity and relaxation kinetics of thin myofilaments. This function implicates PAK3 in the fine-tuning of muscle contractility and suggests a potential role in the regulation of cardiac and smooth muscle physiology (somanath2023targetingp21activatedkinase1 pages 21-22).  
In early neuronal development, PAK3 may contribute to processes such as neuronal progenitor proliferation and differentiation, although its most well-defined functions relate to the establishment and maintenance of synaptic structures in mature neurons. Its activity is tightly regulated in a tissue-specific manner, with predominant expression in the brain and pituitary, thereby ensuring that its kinase activity is appropriately channeled to support the specialized functions of central nervous system cells (rudolph2015inhibitorsofp21activated pages 1-2, dummler2009pakproteinkinases pages 6-7, rane2014p21activatedkinases pages 1-2).

8. Other Comments  
Several small-molecule inhibitors have been developed targeting Group I PAKs, and some of these compounds exhibit significant inhibitory activity against PAK3. For example, FRAX486, an ATP-competitive inhibitor, has been reported to inhibit PAK3 with an IC50 value of 39 nM, while allosteric inhibitors such as IPA3 have been employed experimentally to probe PAK function despite comparatively lower potency (wang2022groupipaks pages 43-43, crawford2012p21activatedkinaseinhibitors pages 13-14).  
PAK3 is also clinically notable because mutations in its gene have been linked to nonsyndromic X‑linked mental retardation. Clinical and genetic studies have shown that loss-of-function mutations in PAK3 result in impairments in synaptic plasticity, dendritic spine formation, and cognitive function. These findings underscore the kinase’s critical role in neural development and the maintenance of proper neuronal circuitry (thevenot2011p21activatedkinase3 pages 1-2, dummler2009pakproteinkinases pages 6-7).  
In addition to its neuronal roles, PAK3's involvement in the phosphorylation of substrates implicated in cytoskeletal remodeling suggests potential contributions to cell migration and possibly tumor cell invasion. Although its role in oncogenic processes appears less prominent when compared to other PAK isoforms such as PAK1, its regulatory functions in cytoskeletal dynamics remain an area of active investigation (rudolph2015inhibitorsofp21activated pages 1-2, dummler2009pakproteinkinases pages 17-21).  
The development of isoform-specific inhibitors for PAK3 remains a challenging yet promising avenue for therapeutic intervention, particularly in neurological disorders where dysregulated PAK3 activity underlies cognitive deficits. Ongoing research efforts to dissect the unique structural and functional features of PAK3 continue to inform strategies for selective pharmacological modulation of this kinase (crawford2012p21activatedkinaseinhibitors pages 16-16, somanath2023targetingp21activatedkinase1 pages 3-5).
