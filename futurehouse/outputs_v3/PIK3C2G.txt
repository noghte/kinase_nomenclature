1. Phylogeny  
Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase C2 domain‐containing subunit gamma (PIK3C2G), also known as PI3K‐C2γ, is a member of the class II phosphoinositide 3‐kinase family that is evolutionarily conserved among metazoans and notably absent from yeast, indicating its emergence with multicellularity (foster2003thephosphoinositide(pi) pages 1-1, gulluni2019classiipi3k pages 1-2).  
Within the human kinome, PIK3C2G is grouped with two other class II isoforms—PIK3C2A and PIK3C2B—and shares a common evolutionary origin with these enzymes, which diverged from the class I and III PI3Ks in early eukaryotic evolution (brown2011phylogenomicsofphosphoinositide pages 1-3, brown2011phylogenomicsofphosphoinositide pages 3-4).  
Phylogenomic analyses have demonstrated that class II PI3Ks belong to a distinct clade within the phosphoinositide 3‐kinase superfamily, a group that evolved alongside other major signaling enzyme families such as AGC kinases, thereby contributing to the complex network of intracellular signaling in higher eukaryotes (brown2011phylogenomicsofphosphoinositide pages 1-3, gulluni2019classiipi3k pages 1-2).  
The human gene encoding PIK3C2G is mapped to chromosome 12p12, a localization that underscores its specialized functions in tissues where its expression is comparatively restricted relative to the broadly expressed class II isoforms like PIK3C2A (gulluni2019classiipi3k pages 21-21, brown2011phylogenomicsofphosphoinositide pages 3-4).  
The conservation of the catalytic core and the unique accessory domains across species indicates that PIK3C2G shares fundamental biochemical roles with its orthologs, while divergence in regulatory regions suggests the development of tissue‐specific functions during vertebrate evolution (foster2003thephosphoinositide(pi) pages 1-1, brown2011phylogenomicsofphosphoinositide pages 3-4).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
PIK3C2G catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphoinositides by transferring a phosphate group from ATP to the 3′-hydroxyl group of the inositol ring, thereby generating key lipid second messengers (chu2021theroleof pages 3-4, foster2003thephosphoinositide(pi) pages 3-4).  
Specifically, the enzyme acts on phosphatidylinositol (PI) to produce phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) and on phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) to yield phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2) in a reaction that can be represented as: ATP + phosphoinositide substrate = ADP + phosphorylated phosphoinositide (chu2021theroleof pages 3-4, gozzelino2020pi(34)p2signalingin pages 3-5).  
This reaction mechanism, common to the PI3K family, is essential for the generation of distinct pools of signaling lipids that regulate various cellular processes such as vesicular trafficking and insulin signaling (chu2021theroleof pages 3-4, brown2011phylogenomicsofphosphoinositide pages 3-4).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The enzymatic activity of PIK3C2G is dependent on the presence of ATP as the phosphate donor and requires divalent metal ions, predominantly Mg²⁺, as essential cofactors for proper catalytic function (foster2003thephosphoinositide(pi) pages 1-1, yu2015differentialregulatoryfunctions pages 46-50).  
The binding of Mg²⁺ facilitates the correct orientation of the ATP molecule within the active site, thereby enabling the transfer of the phosphate group during the catalytic reaction (yu2015differentialregulatoryfunctions pages 46-50).

4. Substrate Specificity  
PIK3C2G exhibits substrate specificity for phosphatidylinositol and its phosphorylated derivative phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate; the enzyme phosphorylates these substrates at the 3′ position of the inositol ring (chu2021theroleof pages 3-4, gozzelino2020pi(34)p2signalingin pages 3-5).  
The reaction predominantly yields PI3P when acting on phosphatidylinositol, and PI(3,4)P2 when acting on phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, thereby contributing to distinct intracellular lipid pools that are spatially confined within specific membrane compartments such as early endosomes (gulluni2019classiipi3k pages 1-2, gozzelino2020pi(34)p2signalingin pages 3-5).  
This substrate specificity underlies the enzyme’s critical role in modulating signal transduction pathways by generating second messengers that operate in precise subcellular locations (gulluni2019classiipi3k pages 15-17, chu2021theroleof pages 3-4).

5. Structure  
PIK3C2G is characterized by a domain architecture that is typical of class II PI3Ks; it contains an N-terminal Ras-binding domain (RBD) followed by a central catalytic kinase domain (chu2021theroleof pages 3-4, foster2003thephosphoinositide(pi) pages 3-4).  
Additionally, the enzyme harbors one or more C2 domains that facilitate membrane binding and are critical for localizing the kinase to specific intracellular compartments (gulluni2019classiipi3k pages 4-5, foster2003thephosphoinositide(pi) pages 3-4).  
A PX (Phox homology) domain is also present, typically near the C-terminus, which is implicated in binding to specific phosphoinositide lipids such as PI(4,5)P₂ and may contribute to the spatial regulation of the enzyme’s activity (parkinson2008crystalstructuresof pages 1-2, yoshioka2021classiiphosphatidylinositol pages 2-4).  
Although no high-resolution crystallographic structure specific to PIK3C2G has yet been published, homology models and structural predictions based on related isoforms indicate that key catalytic features—including the helical domain, activation loop, and hydrophobic spine—are conserved within its kinase domain (chu2021theroleof pages 3-4, foster2003thephosphoinositide(pi) pages 3-4).  
Unique structural aspects of PIK3C2G, when compared to its class II counterparts, include the absence of certain domains such as a clathrin-binding motif that is present in PIK3C2A, which may reflect its specialized role in membrane trafficking that is distinct from clathrin-mediated processes (margaria2019classiipi3ks pages 13-14, gulluni2019classiipi3k pages 4-5).

6. Regulation  
Regulation of PIK3C2G is mediated primarily through its subcellular localization and interaction with small GTPases, particularly Rab5, which facilitates its recruitment to early endosomal membranes (gulluni2019classiipi3k pages 15-17, margaria2019classiipi3ks pages 7-9).  
This membrane recruitment is a key regulatory mechanism that restricts the enzyme’s activity spatially, ensuring that the generation of PI(3,4)P₂ occurs at defined membrane domains where it can participate in downstream signal transduction (margaria2019classiipi3ks pages 9-11, tran2022functionalimportanceof pages 124-126).  
In contrast to class I PI3Ks, PIK3C2G operates as a monomer without association with a separate regulatory subunit, and its activity is influenced by intramolecular interactions among its own domains (chu2021theroleof pages 3-4, gulluni2019classiipi3k pages 15-17).  
Although site-specific post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation have been described for other kinases, detailed mapping of such modifications on PIK3C2G has not been fully documented in the available literature (margaria2019classiipi3ks pages 13-14, mohan2017scaffoldingfunctionof pages 22-30).

7. Function  
PIK3C2G plays a critical role in intracellular signaling by catalyzing the production of two important phosphoinositide second messengers—PI3P and PI(3,4)P₂—which are essential for regulating vesicular trafficking and endosomal signal propagation (chu2021theroleof pages 3-4, gozzelino2020pi(34)p2signalingin pages 3-5).  
The enzyme exhibits a relatively restricted expression pattern, being predominantly expressed in tissues such as liver, pancreas, breast, prostate, and small intestine, which suggests involvement in specialized metabolic functions (gulluni2019classiipi3k pages 15-17, margaria2019classiipi3ks pages 1-4).  
Through the production of PI(3,4)P₂ on early endosomes, PIK3C2G facilitates sustained activation of Akt2 in response to insulin receptor stimulation, thereby modulating the activity of glycogen synthase and contributing to the maintenance of glucose homeostasis (chu2021theroleof pages 3-4, gozzelino2020pi(34)p2signalingin pages 8-10).  
In addition to its metabolic role, PIK3C2G has been implicated by similarity in SDF1A‐stimulated chemotactic processes, indicating a potential function in modulating cell migration in response to chemokine signals (chu2021theroleof pages 3-4).  
Variations in the expression levels or gene copy number of PIK3C2G have been associated with metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidemia, as well as with poor prognostic outcomes in certain cancers including colorectal cancer, thereby highlighting its significance as both a metabolic regulator and a potential biomarker in oncology (chu2021theroleof pages 3-4, margaria2019classiipi3ks pages 9-11).

8. Other Comments  
Currently, no highly selective inhibitors are available that target PIK3C2G specifically; available pan-PI3K inhibitors exhibit relatively low potency against class II isoforms, including PIK3C2G (foster2003thephosphoinositide(pi) pages 2-3, gulluni2019classiipi3k pages 1-2).  
Genetic studies have suggested that polymorphisms and copy number variations in the PIK3C2G gene may be linked with metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and also with adverse outcomes in certain cancers, particularly colorectal cancer (chu2021theroleof pages 3-4, margaria2019classiipi3ks pages 13-14).  
The enzyme’s restricted tissue expression profile and its ability to generate distinct phosphoinositide pools in specific subcellular locations provide rationale for further investigation into its regulatory mechanisms and its potential as a therapeutic target in metabolic diseases and cancer (gulluni2019classiipi3k pages 21-21, margaria2019classiipi3ks pages 9-11).  
Ongoing structural studies and the development of predictive homology models aim to elucidate the detailed three-dimensional architecture of PIK3C2G, which may eventually facilitate the design of isoform-specific inhibitors (parkinson2008crystalstructuresof pages 1-2, yoshioka2021classiiphosphatidylinositol pages 2-4).
