1. Phylogeny  
Serine/threonine‐protein kinase PINK1 is a widely conserved member of the serine/threonine kinase family that is present in diverse metazoan species. Extensive phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that orthologs of PINK1 can be found from invertebrates such as nematodes and arthropods up to vertebrates, with the protein emerging in lineages that possess developed nervous systems (cardona2011phylogeneticandin pages 1-2, cardona2011phylogeneticandin pages 2-3). Comparative studies have grouped PINK1 along with other kinases involved in nervous system function—often collectively referred to as nervous system kinases (NSKs)—which include CaMKI, CaMKII, and DMPK. Although PINK1 shares only limited sequence similarity (approximately 25% in its catalytic domain) with members of the CaMK family, it features several unique insertions that distinguish its kinase domain from canonical serine/threonine kinases (cardona2011phylogeneticandin pages 3-5, cardona2011phylogeneticandin pages 7-8). These insertions, particularly within the N‐lobe (Ins1, Ins2, and the highly conserved Ins3), are not only evolutionarily diagnostic but also critical for substrate recognition and catalytic regulation. Moreover, the phylogenetic distribution of PINK1 emphasizes its specialization in mitochondrial quality control mechanisms that became increasingly important with the evolution of complex cellular bioenergetics and neuronal function.

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
PINK1 catalyzes an ATP‐dependent phosphorylation reaction in which it transfers the terminal (γ) phosphate group from ATP to serine or threonine residues on protein substrates. The primary physiological substrates for PINK1 are ubiquitin and the ubiquitin‐like (Ubl) domain of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin. Specifically, PINK1 phosphorylates both ubiquitin and Parkin at serine residue 65, a modification that is vital for the subsequent activation of Parkin and the initiation of mitophagy. Thus, the generalized reaction catalyzed by PINK1 can be described by the equation:  
  ATP + [protein]–(L‑serine/threonine) → ADP + [protein]–(L‑serine/threonine)‑phosphate + H⁺  
This reaction is fundamental to the mitochondrial quality control pathway, as the phosphorylation events propagate the signaling cascade that promotes the selective degradation of damaged mitochondria (durcan2015thethree‘p’s pages 2-3, kondapalli2012pink1isactivated pages 11-12).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The kinase activity of PINK1 is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions that act as essential cofactors during catalysis. As is typical for serine/threonine kinases, PINK1 requires magnesium ions (Mg²⁺) to coordinate ATP binding and facilitate the correct positioning of the γ‐phosphate for transfer onto substrate hydroxyl groups. The Mg²⁺ ion functions by stabilizing the negative charges on the phosphate groups of ATP and thus is indispensable for achieving an active complex formation during the catalytic cycle (sim2012analysisofthe pages 7-8, rasool2022mechanismofpink1 pages 69-73).

4. Substrate Specificity  
PINK1 displays a pronounced substrate specificity that is centered on its ability to phosphorylate ubiquitin and the Ubl domain of Parkin at serine 65. Although a broad consensus phosphorylation motif for PINK1 has not been universally defined, multiple studies indicate that the substrate recognition mechanism relies on both the three-dimensional conformation of the substrate as well as specific sequence features within the ubiquitin fold. Ubiquitin, which exhibits a characteristic β‑grasp fold, contains an analogous serine 65 residue that becomes the principal site for phosphorylation. This phosphorylation event is critical for increasing the binding affinity of ubiquitin toward Parkin and for facilitating the conformational changes required for Parkin activation (goncalves2021pink1abridge pages 1-2, kondapalli2012pink1isactivated pages 11-12). In addition, PINK1 may phosphorylate other mitochondrial proteins involved in quality control pathways, yet the robust and well‐characterized substrate remains ubiquitin and the Parkin Ubl domain. The unique structure of PINK1’s kinase domain—with its distinctive insertions—appears to create a substrate binding groove that is particularly suited for accommodating the β‑grasp fold of ubiquitin (gan2024interactionofpink1 pages 4-5, gan2024interactionofpink1 pages 5-6).

5. Structure  
PINK1 is composed of 581 amino acids and several distinct structural domains that collectively dictate its localization, regulation, and catalytic function. At the extreme N‐terminus, PINK1 harbors a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) that directs its import into healthy mitochondria. Following the MTS, a transmembrane segment and adjacent outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) localization signal (OMS) facilitate the proper membrane anchoring of the full‐length protein under conditions of mitochondrial depolarization (brunelli2023functionalcharacterizationof pages 17-22). The core of PINK1 consists of a bilobal kinase domain that is sub‐divided into an N‑lobe and a C‑lobe. This kinase domain exhibits several conserved motifs that are essential for catalytic function; these include the glycine-rich P-loop for ATP binding, the HRD motif housed within the catalytic loop for orienting substrates, and the DFG and APE motifs in the activation segment that coordinate magnesium ion binding and substrate positioning (sim2006cterminaltruncationand pages 2-3, sim2012analysisofthe pages 7-8).  
Uniquely, the N‑lobe of PINK1’s kinase domain contains three characteristic insertions – designated Ins1, Ins2, and Ins3 – of which Ins3 is particularly conserved across species and has been implicated in substrate binding and regulatory control. In addition, PINK1 features a C‑terminal extension (CTE) that has been suggested to participate in modulating kinase activity and contributing to protein stability (goncalves2021pink1abridge pages 2-4, kumar2017structureofpink1 pages 1-2). The absence of a full-length high-resolution structure for human PINK1 has been remedied in part by crystallographic studies on insect orthologs, such as those from Tribolium castaneum and Pediculus humanus corporis, which reveal a canonical kinase fold modified by these unique insertions and extensions (schubert2017structureofpink1 pages 1-3). Key catalytic features include the appropriately positioned αC-helix, the hydrophobic spine (R-spine) that aligns in the active conformation, and the activation loop that undergoes autophosphorylation to stabilize the enzyme’s active form. These structural elements collectively provide a framework to accommodate ATP binding and promote efficient phosphotransfer to substrate proteins (sim2006cterminaltruncationand pages 4-5, sim2012analysisofthe pages 8-9).

6. Regulation  
The regulation of PINK1 activity is governed by a complex interplay of proteolytic processing, autophosphorylation, protein–protein interactions, and conformational dynamics that are tightly linked to mitochondrial health. Under normal, energetic conditions, PINK1 is imported into mitochondria via the translocases of the outer and inner membranes (TOM/TIM complexes). Within the mitochondrial compartment, the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) and the intramembrane protease PARL cleave the N-terminal MTS and transmembrane domain, respectively, leading to the generation of a shorter, 52 kDa form that is subsequently retro-translocated to the cytosol for rapid degradation via the ubiquitin–proteasome system (brunelli2023functionalcharacterizationof pages 17-22, vizziello2021disruptionofmitochondrial pages 2-4).  
In contrast, mitochondrial damage or depolarization inhibits the import and cleavage of PINK1, resulting in the accumulation of the full-length protein on the OMM. At the OMM, PINK1 dimerizes and undergoes autophosphorylation at several key residues—including Ser228, Thr257, and Ser402—which are critical for its activation and enable it to phosphorylate its substrates (durcan2015thethree‘p’s pages 2-3, kondapalli2012pink1isactivated pages 7-8). This autophosphorylation not only stabilizes PINK1 in an active conformation but also facilitates the recruitment and phosphorylation of Parkin at its ubiquitin-like domain, thereby relieving Parkin’s autoinhibitory interactions (kondapalli2012pink1isactivated pages 3-4). The regulatory process is further modulated by the conformation of the kinase domain and the unique insert regions, which are believed to help determine substrate selectivity without affecting autophosphorylation significantly (goncalves2021pink1abridge pages 4-5).

7. Function  
PINK1 functions as a pivotal mitochondrial damage sensor that orchestrates mitochondrial quality control through its kinase activity. Its primary role is to detect and respond to mitochondrial dysfunction by initiating a cascade of phosphorylation events that culminate in the selective clearance of damaged mitochondria via mitophagy. Under conditions of mitochondrial stress or depolarization, the accumulation of full-length PINK1 on the OMM leads to the phosphorylation of both ubiquitin and the Ubl domain of Parkin at serine 65. These phosphorylation events serve to activate Parkin’s E3 ubiquitin ligase function, resulting in the ubiquitination of numerous outer mitochondrial membrane proteins, which in turn marks the mitochondrion for autophagic removal (kondapalli2012pink1isactivated pages 4-5, durcan2015thethree‘p’s pages 2-3).  
In addition to its role in mediating mitophagy, PINK1 is implicated in several other cellular processes. It plays a part in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics by influencing the balance between fusion and fission events, thereby contributing to mitochondrial network morphology. PINK1 activity has also been associated with anti-apoptotic functions, as it can phosphorylate key regulators involved in cell survival pathways. The expression of PINK1 is observed in tissues with high metabolic demand, notably in the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle, where the maintenance of mitochondrial integrity is essential for cellular homeostasis (vizziello2021disruptionofmitochondrial pages 2-4, sim2006cterminaltruncationand pages 7-8). Loss or mutation of PINK1, which impairs its kinase activity, has been directly linked to autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinson’s disease due to the consequent failure in removing dysfunctional mitochondria and the resulting buildup of cellular stress (sim2006cterminaltruncationand pages 2-3, sim2012analysisofthe pages 9-10).

8. Other Comments  
Though the development of selective inhibitors for PINK1 is not as advanced as for some other kinases, research using small-molecule modulators has provided preliminary insights into potential avenues for therapeutic intervention. Several studies have identified compounds capable of affecting PINK1’s kinase activity through binding within its ATP-binding pocket; however, these inhibitors are primarily in the experimental phase and serve as chemical probes rather than clinically validated drugs. In addition, a number of disease-associated mutations—such as those impacting conserved residues of the ATP-binding region and the activation segment (for example, mutations within the DFG motif or in residues implicated in substrate binding)—have been mapped. These mutations down-regulate the kinase function of PINK1 and compromise its ability to phosphorylate downstream substrates, thereby impairing mitochondrial quality control and leading to neurodegeneration in patients with familial Parkinson’s disease (sim2006cterminaltruncationand pages 2-3, sim2012analysisofthe pages 9-10). The disruption of PINK1 function by these mutations underscores its central role in the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis and highlights the importance of this kinase as a potential therapeutic target in Parkinson’s disease.
