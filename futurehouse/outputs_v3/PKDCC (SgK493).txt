1. Phylogeny  
Extracellular tyrosine‐protein kinase PKDCC, also known as SGK493 or VLK (Vertebrate Lonesome Kinase), is assigned to a novel branch of the eukaryotic kinome that is distinct from canonical cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases. Sequence‐based phylogenetic analyses using maximum likelihood and homology‐detection approaches have placed PKDCC within a clade that shows significant evolutionary relatedness to the FAM69 family of kinases, which are characterized by non‐canonical features when compared to well‐studied AGC or receptor tyrosine kinase families (dudkiewicz2013anovelpredicted pages 8-9). In this context, PKDCC exhibits a kinase domain that, while retaining overall similarities to classical protein kinases, lacks several of the canonical subdomains, such as subdomains V, IX, X, and XI, thereby marking it as an atypical member within the kinome. Furthermore, available data indicate that PKDCC is highly conserved among vertebrates and is largely restricted to this group, as its presence has not been clearly evidenced in invertebrate genomes; such a distribution is consistent with its designation as the “vertebrate” lonesome kinase, underscoring an evolutionary divergence that may relate to the complex demands of vertebrate organogenesis (dudkiewicz2013anovelpredicted pages 8-9, yan2023prenataldiagnosisto pages 7-8). Comparative analysis of kinase families has shown that the evolutionary history of PKDCC can be traced back to early metazoan ancestors, with subsequent gene duplications and domain rearrangements giving rise to its unique structural and functional characteristics. The kinome classification proposed in seminal studies on the human kinome places PKDCC in a group with several atypical secretory pathway kinases, and its orthologs have been identified in multiple vertebrate species, highlighting its conserved role in tissue development and homeostasis (du2023regulationofsecretory pages 7-8). In summary, the phylogenetic context of PKDCC is defined by its inclusion in a novel, vertebrate‐restricted kinase family that diverges significantly from the classical models, a divergence that is evidenced by both its atypical domain architecture and its specific evolutionary distribution among higher eukaryotes (dudkiewicz2013anovelpredicted pages 8-9, du2023regulationofsecretory pages 7-8, yan2023prenataldiagnosisto pages 7-8).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
PKDCC catalyzes the phosphorylation reaction in which a phosphate group from ATP is transferred to a target protein substrate. In biochemical terms, the reaction can be represented as: ATP + protein–OH → ADP + protein–O–phosphate + H⁺. Although PKDCC is primarily classified as a tyrosine kinase, it may also exhibit serine/threonine phosphorylation activity on select substrates; however, its predominant activity in the secretory pathway is directed toward phosphorylating tyrosine residues on extracellular proteins and ER‐resident proteins (du2023regulationofsecretory pages 7-8). This kinase reaction thus represents the classic phosphotransfer mechanism that is a hallmark of protein kinases, whereby the phosphoryl group is catalytically transferred from the γ-phosphate of ATP to the hydroxyl group present on the aromatic side chain of tyrosine (du2023regulationofsecretory pages 7-8).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
Like many other members of the protein kinase superfamily, PKDCC requires divalent metal ions for its catalytic activity. The catalytic mechanism of PKDCC depends on the presence of Mg²⁺, which is essential for the coordination and proper positioning of ATP in the active site during phosphotransfer, thereby facilitating efficient phosphoryl transfer to the substrate (du2023regulationofsecretory pages 7-8). In addition, structural analyses of related secreted kinases have suggested that Ca²⁺ may contribute to the regulation of kinase activity by influencing structural conformations through EF-hand motifs; while experimental confirmation of a strict Ca²⁺ dependency in PKDCC has not been fully documented, its evolutionary relationship with calcium-regulated kinases suggests that Ca²⁺ could play a modulatory role (dudkiewicz2013anovelpredicted pages 6-8).

4. Substrate Specificity  
The substrate specificity of PKDCC is defined by its capacity to phosphorylate a broad portfolio of extracellular substrates, predominantly those involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and cellular signaling during organogenesis. PKDCC has been shown to target several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), including MMP1, MMP13, MMP14, and MMP19, as well as the ER chaperone ERP29, thereby implicating the kinase in processes such as collagen maturation and extracellular matrix assembly (du2023regulationofsecretory pages 7-8). Notably, a precise consensus phosphorylation motif for PKDCC has not been definitively determined. Instead, substrate recognition appears to be governed by the proximity of phosphorylation sites to functional domains that are critical for substrate function, which may contribute to the broad specificity observed for extracellular proteins (du2023regulationofsecretory pages 7-8). The absence of a well-defined substrate consensus sequence suggests that structural context and local protein conformation play dominant roles in guiding substrate selection by PKDCC, in contrast to many cytoplasmic kinases that recognize short linear motifs (du2023regulationofsecretory pages 7-8).

5. Structure  
PKDCC is characterized by a unique domain organization that sets it apart from many classical cytoplasmic protein kinases. The protein possesses an N-terminal signal peptide that is essential for directing the kinase through the secretory pathway; this sequence ensures that PKDCC is co-translationally targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequently modified through extensive glycosylation (du2023regulationofsecretory pages 7-8). Its catalytic core, although homologous to that of conventional protein kinases, lacks several canonical kinase subdomains—including subdomains V, IX, X, and XI—which normally contribute to substrate binding and ATP coordination in classical kinases (dudkiewicz2013anovelpredicted pages 2-4). Structural modeling based on homology techniques indicates that the kinase domain of PKDCC adopts a fold that is very similar to that of eukaryotic protein kinases; however, unique structural features such as a divergence in the conventional glycine-rich ATP-binding loop and the incorporation of additional cysteine residues (which may form disulfide bridges) have been predicted (dudkiewicz2013anovelpredicted pages 2-4, 6-8). These unique features may contribute not only to a modified ATP-binding modality but also to an altered configuration of the active site that is optimized for phosphorylation within the secretory environment. In addition, the overall tertiary structure of PKDCC is predicted to include regions resembling regulatory segments that are typical of secretory kinases, and these regions are thought to modulate catalytic activity through conformational transitions. Although no high-resolution X-ray crystallographic structure of PKDCC is currently available in the peer-reviewed literature, computational models derived from homologous structures provide key insights into its three-dimensional architecture, including a centrally located catalytic domain flanked by the signal peptide at the N-terminus and likely flexible, disordered regions in the C-terminus that may mediate protein-protein interactions (dudkiewicz2013anovelpredicted pages 8-9, du2023regulationofsecretory pages 7-8).

6. Regulation  
The regulatory mechanisms controlling PKDCC activity are multifaceted and remain under active investigation. A key feature of PKDCC regulation is the capacity for autophosphorylation, a common regulatory mechanism among kinases that facilitates conformational shifts leading to full catalytic activity. Autophosphorylation events within the kinase domain are essential for achieving an active conformation that allows efficient substrate phosphorylation (du2023regulationofsecretory pages 7-8). Although specific autophosphorylation sites have been reported in certain studies, such as those implicating tyrosine and serine residues as regulatory elements, the detailed characterization of these phosphorylation events in PKDCC is still emerging. In addition to autophosphorylation, the secretion and expression of PKDCC are regulated in a manner that reflects its role in development and tissue differentiation. For instance, studies using embryonic models have demonstrated that PKDCC expression is tightly controlled in a tissue-specific and developmental stage-dependent context, with high expression levels noted in condensing mesenchymal cells, limb buds, and branchial arches during embryogenesis (yan2023prenataldiagnosisto pages 7-8). Moreover, PKDCC is rapidly and quantitatively secreted from platelets in response to specific physiological stimuli such as platelet degranulation, suggesting that its regulation is also coupled to extracellular signaling events and acute cellular responses (du2023regulationofsecretory pages 7-8). There is also evidence to suggest that calcium ions may have a modulatory effect on PKDCC activity, with its structural relationship to other calcium-regulated kinases implying that Ca²⁺ binding could influence kinase conformation and activity, although direct experimental validation of this mechanism in PKDCC remains to be fully elucidated (dudkiewicz2013anovelpredicted pages 6-8).

7. Function  
PKDCC plays multiple critical roles during vertebrate development by mediating the phosphorylation of extracellular proteins and endogenous proteins within the secretory pathway. One of the primary biological functions of PKDCC is its involvement in skeletal development and longitudinal bone growth. This is achieved through the regulation of chondrocyte differentiation; studies have demonstrated that disruptions in PKDCC function are associated with developmental abnormalities such as rhizomelic limb shortening with dysmorphic features, a condition that has been identified in prenatal diagnostic settings (yan2023prenataldiagnosisto pages 7-8). In addition to its role in skeletal morphogenesis, PKDCC facilitates extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling by targeting key proteins including several matrix metalloproteinases (MMP1, MMP13, MMP14, and MMP19) and the ER chaperone ERP29. Through these phosphorylation events, PKDCC is implicated in the maturation of collagen and other ECM components, thereby contributing to the architectural organization and mechanical integrity of developing tissues (du2023regulationofsecretory pages 7-8). Another functional aspect of PKDCC is its contribution to intracellular protein transport; by phosphorylating substrates in the secretory pathway, PKDCC may indirectly influence the trafficking of proteins from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, its rapid secretion from platelets upon stimulation suggests an additional role in the regulation of platelet function and hemostasis, potentially impacting processes such as wound repair and vascular remodeling (du2023regulationofsecretory pages 7-8). PKDCC also interacts with key developmental signaling pathways, including components of the Hedgehog and Wnt pathways; for example, genetic interactions with Gli3 and involvement in Wnt receptor modulation have been reported, further underscoring its importance in orchestrating complex developmental programs (du2023regulationofsecretory pages 7-8, yan2023prenataldiagnosisto pages 7-8).

8. Other Comments  
In addition to its fundamental roles in development and extracellular protein modification, PKDCC is of significant clinical interest due to its association with several skeletal disorders. Genetic studies have linked mutations in the PKDCC gene to conditions such as rhizomelic limb shortening with dysmorphic features, which manifest as severe skeletal dysplasias characterized by shortened limbs, craniofacial abnormalities, and impaired ossification (yan2023prenataldiagnosisto pages 7-8). In genome-wide association studies, PKDCC has also been implicated in bone-related traits such as bone mineral density and quantitative ultrasound measurements, supporting its critical role in osteogenesis and skeletal integrity (du2023regulationofsecretory pages 7-8). Moreover, the observation that PKDCC is rapidly secreted from platelets upon stimulation suggests that it may serve as a biomarker for platelet activation and could potentially be targeted in disorders associated with abnormal platelet function. Although specific inhibitors for PKDCC have not yet been comprehensively characterized, the development of small molecules to modulate its activity represents a prospective avenue for therapeutic intervention, particularly in the context of skeletal dysplasias and possibly in conditions linked to aberrant ECM remodeling. The integration of genetic association data with functional studies has elevated PKDCC as a candidate gene of interest not only for developmental disorders but also for adult pathologies such as osteoporosis and other bone-mineralization defects. Continued research is needed to further elucidate the structural mechanisms that govern its activity, the full spectrum of its substrates, and the regulatory networks in which it participates (du2023regulationofsecretory pages 7-8, yan2023prenataldiagnosisto pages 7-8).
