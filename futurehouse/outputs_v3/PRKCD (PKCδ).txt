1. Phylogeny  
Protein kinase C delta (PKCδ), encoded by the PRKCD gene and also known as nPKC‐δ or tyrosine‐protein kinase PRKCD, is a member of the protein kinase C (PKC) family that is part of the large AGC kinase superfamily. As classified by studies of the human kinome, PKCδ is grouped within the novel PKC subfamily, which is characterized by its calcium‐independent yet diacylglycerol (DAG)‐dependent activation mechanism. Orthologs of PKCδ are found throughout mammals and other eukaryotic organisms, attesting to its conservation over evolutionary time. Its phylogenetic placement – along with other PKC isoenzymes – traces back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes, and its catalytic domain exhibits extensive conservation among species, reflecting its essential role in intracellular signaling (miao2022roleandmechanism pages 1-2, newton2003regulationofthe pages 2-3, webb2000proteinkinasec pages 1-2).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
PKCδ functions as a serine/threonine kinase and catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of target proteins. The chemical reaction it mediates can be described as follows:  
  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺.  
This transfer of a phosphoryl group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins underlies the modulation of various signaling cascades (newton2003regulationofthe pages 1-2, sridhar2000proteinkinasesas pages 1-2).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The catalytic activity of PKCδ is dependent on essential cofactors. In addition to the common requirement for a divalent metal ion, Mg²⁺ is necessary for facilitating the phosphoryl transfer reaction from ATP. Unlike conventional PKC isoforms, PKCδ is calcium-independent; however, its activation is contingent upon binding lipid cofactors such as diacylglycerol (DAG) and phosphatidylserine (PS). These lipid cofactors mediate membrane association, which is critical for the enzyme’s activation and subsequent substrate phosphorylation (miao2022roleandmechanism pages 1-2, newton2003regulationofthe pages 1-2, webb2000proteinkinasec pages 2-3, farah2012theroleof pages 1-4).

4. Substrate Specificity  
PKCδ phosphorylates serine and threonine residues on a diverse range of substrate proteins. Although a strict consensus phosphorylation motif for PKCδ is not universally defined, its substrate recognition often involves docking interactions that occur outside the ATP-binding pocket. For instance, studies indicate that PKCδ phosphorylates cardiac troponin I at Ser23/Ser24, modulating myocardial contractile function, and it is also implicated in the phosphorylation of substrates involved in apoptotic pathways such as targets that regulate BCLAF1-mediated transcription in response to DNA damage. The substrate specificity appears to rely on sequence context and the availability of docking interfaces that facilitate selective binding, with basic or hydrophobic residues often contributing to effective substrate recognition (miao2022roleandmechanism pages 2-4, farah2012theroleof pages 20-21, lichtmurava2012exploitingsubstraterecognition pages 1-2).

5. Structure  
PKCδ is organized into distinct modular domains that confer both regulatory and catalytic functions. The overall architecture is divided into an amino-terminal regulatory region and a carboxy-terminal catalytic domain. The regulatory region contains tandem C1 domains that specifically bind diacylglycerol (DAG) and phosphatidylserine (PS), thereby controlling membrane anchoring and localization. In contrast to conventional PKCs, the C2-like domain in PKCδ does not bind Ca²⁺ and instead contributes to protein–protein interactions necessary for regulation. A variable hinge (V3) segment connects the regulatory elements to the catalytic core.  
The catalytic domain of PKCδ houses conserved subdomains (often designated as C3 and C4) that include an ATP-binding pocket, an activation loop, a turn motif, and a hydrophobic motif. These structural elements are responsible for both autoinhibition and subsequent activation upon release of the pseudosubstrate sequence that normally occupies the substrate-binding cleft. This domain organization, as predicted by crystallographic studies and reinforced by AlphaFold model predictions, emphasizes a bilobal structure typical of protein kinases, where the smaller N-terminal lobe contains the glycine-rich loop and the larger C-terminal lobe provides the substrate recognition surface (farah2012theroleof pages 18-20, newton2003regulationofthe pages 2-3, webb2000proteinkinasec pages 2-3, miao2022roleandmechanism pages 4-5, silnitsky2023anupdateon pages 36-37).

6. Regulation  
The activity of PKCδ is finely tuned by a combination of post-translational modifications and ligand binding events. Phosphorylation at multiple residues plays a pivotal role in governing its activation status. Initial phosphorylation by upstream kinases such as phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) targets the activation loop, which is subsequently followed by autophosphorylation events at the turn and hydrophobic motifs; these modifications stabilize the mature, catalytically competent form of the enzyme.  
In addition to serine/threonine phosphorylation, PKCδ is subject to tyrosine phosphorylation by members of the Src family kinases. Tyrosine phosphorylation at specific sites within the regulatory and hinge regions has been shown to alter substrate specificity and promote membrane translocation in response to oxidative stress. Moreover, during apoptosis, caspase-3-mediated proteolytic cleavage generates a constitutively active catalytic fragment that is capable of nuclear translocation and sustained kinase activity. Lipid binding further regulates PKCδ by promoting the necessary conformational shifts required for activation; DAG and PS binding displace the autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate, thereby facilitating substrate access. Collectively, these regulatory mechanisms—including multisite phosphorylation, tyrosine modification, and lipid cofactor binding—ensure that PKCδ activity is tightly modulated in response to diverse cellular signals (miao2022roleandmechanism pages 2-4, miao2022roleandmechanism pages 12-12, farah2012theroleof pages 16-18, chen2017proteinkinasec pages 1-1, silnitsky2023anupdateon pages 38-39, newton2003regulationofthe pages 6-7).

7. Function  
PKCδ is a multifunctional kinase with context-dependent roles in cell fate determination. It exhibits contrasting activities under different cellular conditions. In response to DNA damage, PKCδ acts as a pro-apoptotic protein. It initiates apoptotic signaling by activating the promoter of death-promoting transcription factors such as BCLAF1/Btf, thereby enhancing p53/TP53 gene transcription and driving programmed cell death. Conversely, during cytokine receptor-mediated cell death, PKCδ can exert anti-apoptotic effects, thereby contributing to cell survival.  
Beyond its role in apoptosis, PKCδ is implicated in tumor suppression as well as in the survival of several cancer types. It negatively regulates B cell proliferation and is necessary for self-antigen–induced B cell tolerance, ensuring proper immune homeostasis. In addition, PKCδ is required for the optimal production of oxygen radicals by NADPH oxidase, an activity that is central to host defense and inflammatory responses. Its involvement in platelet signaling further underscores its dual capacity to function as both a positive and negative regulator of cellular responses depending on the physiological context. These diverse biological roles are reflected in its complex regulation and widespread expression in tissues such as the heart, immune cells, and epithelial cells (miao2022roleandmechanism pages 8-9, miao2022roleandmechanism pages 9-10, farah2012theroleof pages 20-21, silnitsky2023anupdateon pages 19-21, sridhar2000proteinkinasesas pages 1-2).

8. Other Comments  
A number of small-molecule and peptide inhibitors have been developed to target PKCδ, although achieving isozyme specificity remains challenging because of the conserved nature of the catalytic domain among PKC family members. Rottlerin, for example, has been used experimentally as a PKCδ inhibitor; however, its lack of selectivity limits its clinical utility. More selective inhibitors, such as the peptide δV1-1 and compounds like delcasertib, have been investigated in preclinical and clinical studies for conditions including acute myocardial infarction, where modulation of PKCδ activity may confer cardioprotection.  
In addition, alterations in PKCδ expression and regulatory modifications have been implicated in a wide array of pathological conditions, notably in various cancers, cardiovascular disorders, and immune-related diseases. The dual role of PKCδ in both promoting apoptosis under genotoxic stress and facilitating survival signaling in other contexts underscores the importance of context-dependent regulation in disease pathogenesis. Its involvement in NADPH oxidase activation and platelet function also highlights potential therapeutic opportunities for modulating inflammatory responses and thrombosis (silnitsky2023anupdateon pages 42-43, brognard2008phlippingtheswitch pages 1-2, miao2022roleandmechanism pages 12-12, webb2000proteinkinasec pages 2-3).
