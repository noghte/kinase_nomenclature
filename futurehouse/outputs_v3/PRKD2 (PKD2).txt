1. Phylogeny  
PKD2, also referred to as PRKD2 or nPKC‐D2, is a member of the protein kinase D (PKD) family, which comprises three closely related serine/threonine kinases: PKD1, PKD2, and PKD3. These kinases are evolutionarily conserved among eukaryotes and are classified within the calcium/calmodulin‐dependent kinase (CAMK) superfamily, distinct from classical protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms despite sharing diacylglycerol (DAG)‐binding C1 domains. Orthologs of PKD2 exist in diverse species including mammals and zebrafish, indicating that the ancestral gene was present early in vertebrate evolution and that subsequent gene duplication events gave rise to the isoforms with overlapping yet specialized functions. Although all PKD isoforms share a high degree of homology within their catalytic domains, variations in their regulatory regions allow for differences in subcellular localization, substrate specificity, and ultimately their cellular functions (avkiran2008proteinkinased pages 1-2, giardoglou2021azebrafishforward pages 1-2, rozengurt2011proteinkinased pages 1-2).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
PKD2 catalyzes a highly specific chemical reaction that involves the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of a serine or threonine residue on a target protein. The general chemical reaction can be represented as:  
  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine-phosphate) + H⁺  
This reaction is fundamental to signal transduction, as the phosphorylation event serves to modulate the activity, subcellular localization, or protein–protein interactions of the substrate, thereby propagating the intracellular signal initiated by extracellular cues (armacki2016identificationandcharacterization pages 14-17, avkiran2008proteinkinased pages 1-2).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The catalytic activity of PKD2 requires divalent metal ions, with Mg²⁺ being essential for facilitating the correct binding and positioning of ATP within the catalytic site. This requirement for Mg²⁺ is common among serine/threonine kinases and is critical for the phosphorylation reaction to proceed efficiently (avkiran2008proteinkinased pages 1-2).

4. Substrate Specificity  
PKD2 phosphorylates serine and threonine residues on its target proteins and displays substrate specificity dictated by a consensus phosphorylation motif. Studies have suggested that PKD2, similar to other PKDs, preferentially recognizes the motif LXRXX(S/T), where the serine/threonine residue is the site of phosphorylation. This motif enables PKD2 to selectively regulate substrates that are involved in processes such as cell proliferation, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and membrane trafficking. The identification of substrates including proteins such as CIB1a reinforces the concept that substrate specificity is a key determinant of PKD2’s role in integrating extracellular signals into appropriate cellular responses (armacki2016identificationandcharacterization pages 14-17).

5. Structure  
The structural organization of PKD2 is defined by a modular architecture that underpins both its regulatory and catalytic functions. At its N-terminus, PKD2 contains an alanine- and proline-rich hydrophobic region followed by two zinc finger-like cysteine-rich domains designated as C1a and C1b. These C1 domains bind DAG and phorbol esters, which induce a conformational change essential for the recruitment of PKD2 to membrane compartments. An unusually long linker region, which separates the two C1 domains, contains a serine-rich stretch unique to PKD2 and may play a role in further modulating the protein’s conformation. Following the C1 region is a segment enriched in negatively charged amino acids and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that exerts autoinhibitory control over the kinase catalytic domain. The C-terminal region of PKD2 encompasses the kinase domain itself, which exhibits the typical bilobal structure found in serine/threonine kinases. Key catalytic features include an activation loop containing critical serine residues (e.g., Ser706 and Ser710) whose phosphorylation by upstream PKC isoforms is required for full activation, as well as autophosphorylation events that stabilize the active state. Notably, unlike PKD1, PKD2 lacks a C-terminal PDZ-binding motif, which influences its pattern of protein–protein interactions and subcellular localization (armacki2016identificationandcharacterization pages 14-17, azoitei2018proteinkinased2 pages 1-2, sundram2011emergingrolesof pages 3-4, avkiran2008proteinkinased pages 5-6). Recent structural models and experimental insights further indicate that the kinase domain of PKD2 maintains conserved features such as the hydrophobic spine and C-helix that are essential for catalytic activity (azoitei2018proteinkinased2 pages 11-12, cobbaut2018functionandregulation pages 2-3).

6. Regulation  
The regulation of PKD2 involves a complex interplay of post-translational modifications, conformational changes, and protein–protein interactions that collectively determine its activation state and functional output. A central regulatory mechanism is the phosphorylation of key serine residues in the activation loop, notably Ser706 and Ser710. These phosphorylation events, typically mediated by novel PKC isoforms such as PKCα, PKCε, and PKCη, rapidly relieve the autoinhibition imposed by the PH domain and trigger catalytic activation. In addition, PKD2 can undergo autophosphorylation that further reinforces its active conformation and extends its signaling output. Phosphorylation within the zinc finger linker region, for example at Ser244, has been shown to modulate nuclear export by interrupting Crm-1 binding, thereby affecting the subcellular distribution of PKD2. The binding of DAG to the C1 domains is another pivotal step that targets PKD2 to membrane microdomains, positioning it for subsequent activation by PKC-mediated phosphorylation. Beyond these phosphorylation events, PKD2 activity is also influenced by caspase-mediated cleavage under apoptotic conditions and by interactions with molecular chaperones such as HSP90, which assist in stabilizing the kinase in a signaling-competent form. These multiple layers of regulation ensure that PKD2 activity is intricately linked to extracellular stimuli such as growth factors, neuropeptides, G protein-coupled receptor agonists, and oxidative stress, thereby precisely controlling downstream signaling pathways (armacki2016identificationandcharacterization pages 14-17, avkiran2008proteinkinased pages 1-2, avkiran2008proteinkinased pages 7-7, azoitei2018proteinkinased2 pages 10-11, cobbaut2018functionandregulation pages 3-4).

7. Function  
PKD2 functions as a pivotal mediator that converts transient diacylglycerol signals into sustained cellular responses. It plays multiple roles in cell signaling by phosphorylating a variety of substrates involved in critical processes such as cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. One prominent function of PKD2 is the regulation of cell proliferation; by potentiating mitogenic signaling, PKD2 extends the duration of MAPK1/3 (ERK1/2) activation, thereby promoting the accumulation of immediate-early gene products including FOS that drive cell cycle progression. In the context of oxidative stress, PKD2 plays a central role in activating the NF-κB pathway, a key survival mechanism that enables cells to adapt to stress conditions. Additionally, PKD2 is involved in the regulation of gene expression through its inhibition of HDAC7-mediated transcriptional repression, which has implications for T-cell receptor (TCR)-mediated cytokine production. Beyond signal transduction, PKD2 is crucial for Golgi membrane trafficking where it regulates the fission of transport vesicles and the release of secretory granules, thereby influencing protein secretion and cell adhesion. In endothelial cells and various tumor cells, PKD2 contributes to angiogenesis and regulates cytoskeletal organization by interacting with regulators of small GTPases such as Rho, Rac, and Cdc42. This multifaceted functionality is further exemplified by its roles in cardiac tissues, where PKD2 participates in myocardial contractility and hypertrophic remodeling, and in platelets, where it modulates aggregation and secretion processes. Collectively, these diverse functions underscore the central role of PKD2 in translating extracellular signals into coordinated intracellular responses (armacki2016identificationandcharacterization pages 17-20, avkiran2008proteinkinased pages 1-2, azoitei2018proteinkinased2 pages 11-12, bhavanasi2011proteinkinasecδ pages 1-2, irie2006proteinkinased2 pages 10-11, qiu2016phostagsdspageresolves pages 1-7, matthews2010uniquefunctionsfor pages 1-2, giardoglou2021azebrafishforward pages 1-2, steinberg2021decodingthecardiac pages 1-2).

8. Other Comments  
Selective pharmacological inhibition of PKD2 remains an area of active research, with several small molecule inhibitors targeting the broader PKD family under preclinical development. In experimental settings, PKC inhibitors such as GF109203X are capable of indirectly suppressing PKD2 activity by blocking phosphorylation events upstream of PKD2 activation. Moreover, the interaction of PKD2 with molecular chaperones like HSP90 offers alternative therapeutic avenues, as HSP90 inhibitors can destabilize PKD2 and attenuate its signaling in certain cancer models. Dysregulation of PKD2 has been implicated in various pathological conditions; in oncology, aberrant PKD2 signaling is associated with enhanced tumor cell proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis observed in cancers such as breast, prostate, pancreatic, and colorectal carcinomas. In the cardiovascular realm, PKD2 contributes to maladaptive myocardial remodeling and hypertrophic responses, while in immune cells, it is critical for T-cell activation and cytokine production. These disease associations and emerging therapeutic strategies underscore the clinical potential of PKD2 as a drug target, though isoform-specific inhibitors with high selectivity for PKD2 over its family members remain to be developed (azoitei2018proteinkinased2 pages 1-2, durand2015functionalandtherapeutic pages 1-2, bhavanasi2011proteinkinasecδ pages 1-2, steinberg2021decodingthecardiac pages 8-9).
