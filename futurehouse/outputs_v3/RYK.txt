1. Phylogeny  
Tyrosine‐protein kinase RYK is classified within the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) superfamily and represents a unique subfamily characterized by an intracellular kinase‐like domain that deviates from the canonical catalytic motifs found in most RTKs. RYK orthologs are present in mammals as well as in lower eukaryotes, with studies in mouse and Drosophila (via its ortholog “derailed”) confirming its conservation across species. This receptor is evolutionarily related to other RTKs identified in metazoans, and its atypical kinase domain places it among pseudokinases that have diverged to serve primarily scaffolding or modulatory roles in signaling rather than to function as conventional enzymes (halford2001revelationsofthe pages 1-2, halford2001revelationsofthe pages 2-4, karvonen2021theroleof pages 29-32).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
In general, tyrosine kinases catalyze the transfer of the γ‐phosphate of ATP to a tyrosine residue on protein substrates, which can be summarized by the chemical reaction:  
  ATP + [protein]-L-tyrosine → ADP + [protein]-L-tyrosine-phosphate + H⁺.  
Although RYK possesses an intracellular domain with homology to protein tyrosine kinases, multiple biochemical analyses have shown a severe attenuation or lack of classical autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation activity in vitro (halford2001revelationsofthe pages 1-2, halford2015therykreceptor pages 14-17).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The kinase reaction catalyzed by typical tyrosine kinases is dependent on divalent cations; in particular, Mg²⁺ is required to coordinate ATP binding and facilitate phosphoryl transfer. Although RYK’s kinase domain is atypical, by analogy with related RTKs the cofactor requirement for Mg²⁺ is assumed to be maintained (bailey2014biochemicalanalysisof pages 17-23).

4. Substrate Specificity  
Active tyrosine kinases usually exhibit defined substrate specificities characterized by consensus motifs in their target sequences. In the case of RYK, however, experimental evidence indicates that it does not display robust intrinsic kinase activity and does not phosphorylate substrates following a clear consensus sequence typical of classical tyrosine kinases. Instead, while RYK contains numerous potential phosphorylation sites within its intracellular domain, substrate phosphorylation is only observed when other active kinases (such as members of the Eph or Src families) are co-expressed. Consequently, a definitive substrate motif for RYK has not been established (halford2001revelationsofthe pages 1-2, halford2015therykreceptor pages 14-17, yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 1-2).

5. Structure  
RYK exhibits a modular architecture typical of receptor tyrosine kinases. Its extracellular region is dominated by a Wnt Inhibitory Factor (WIF) domain, which is structurally configured as a β‐sandwich fold and contains a putative lipid-binding pocket. In RYK, however, a conserved arginine within the WIF domain appears to sterically hinder lipid binding, thus differentiating its extracellular function from that of related molecules such as WIF-1 (malinauskas2011structuralandfunctional pages 90-96). Following the large extracellular region is a single transmembrane helix that anchors the receptor in the plasma membrane. The intracellular domain comprises a juxtamembrane segment—often enriched in serine/threonine clusters—and a C-terminal protein tyrosine kinase-like domain. Extensive sequence analyses have revealed that this intracellular domain lacks several of the canonical motifs required for effective ATP binding and phosphotransferase activity; for example, substitutions in the glycine-rich ATP-binding loop and alterations in key catalytic residues are consistently observed (halford2001revelationsofthe pages 2-4, halford2015therykreceptor pages 12-14). Although the kinase domain adopts the general bilobal architecture seen in tyrosine kinases—with an N-terminal lobe composed largely of β-sheets and an αC-helix, and a C-terminal lobe that is predominantly α-helical—the deviations in several conserved subdomains have led to its classification as a pseudokinase. In addition, a conserved PDZ-binding motif at the extreme C-terminus may facilitate interactions with scaffolding proteins, thereby modulating downstream signaling without necessitating classical catalytic activity (halford2015therykreceptor pages 12-14, loris2007exploringstructureand pages 27-28, karvonen2021theroleof pages 29-32).

6. Regulation  
RYK is regulated predominantly through mechanisms that differ from those of classical active kinases. One key regulatory event is proteolytic processing: upon binding of Wnt ligands—for example, WNT3—the extracellular region is cleaved within the transmembrane domain. This cleavage event liberates an intracellular fragment that subsequently translocates to the nucleus where it may participate in transcriptional regulation (halford2015therykreceptor pages 1-5, halford2015therykreceptor pages 48-50). Furthermore, while direct autophosphorylation of RYK has not been consistently observed, phosphorylation on its tyrosine residues is reported when RYK is co-expressed with active kinases such as EphB2, EphB3, or SRC64B. In this context, RYK appears to be phosphorylated in trans rather than through intrinsic catalytic activity. In addition, the intracellular fragment generated by proteolytic cleavage is subject to polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation, suggesting that its cellular levels are tightly controlled by post-translational modifications (halford2015therykreceptor pages 14-17).

7. Function  
RYK functions primarily as a co-receptor within the Wnt signaling pathway. It binds a subset of Wnt proteins, including WNT1, WNT3, WNT3A, and WNT5A, in conjunction with Frizzled receptors—such as FZD8—to mediate non‐canonical Wnt signaling events. These signaling events are critical for several developmental processes, including neuronal differentiation, axon guidance, and the establishment of interhemispheric connections such as the corpus callosum, as well as for promoting neurite outgrowth. In response to specific Wnt ligands, the proteolytic cleavage of RYK facilitates the release and nuclear translocation of its intracellular fragment, thereby enabling it to contribute to transcriptional programs that are essential for neuronal development. Expression studies have demonstrated that RYK is present in various embryonic tissues as well as in differentiated adult tissues, supporting its role in the regulation of developmental and cell guidance processes (halford2001revelationsofthe pages 1-2, halford2015therykreceptor pages 48-50, sakamoto2001expressionofdiscoidin pages 6-6).

8. Other Comments  
Despite being classified as a protein tyrosine kinase, RYK exhibits characteristics that are more in keeping with pseudokinases; its kinase-like domain does not display robust catalytic activity under standard in vitro conditions, and its phosphorylation appears contingent on the activity of other kinases. RYK has been incorporated into kinome array profiling studies of patient-derived pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma samples, which underscores its potential relevance in oncogenic signaling networks (creeden2020kinomearrayprofiling pages 28-30). To date, no selective inhibitors have been established for RYK, and its atypical kinase domain has posed challenges for the development of small molecules targeting its catalytic activity. Nevertheless, the receptor’s unique mode of regulation—via proteolytic cleavage and nuclear translocation—and its pivotal role in mediating Wnt-dependent signaling in neuronal tissues highlight its importance in both developmental biology and disease contexts (halford2015therykreceptor pages 14-17, karvonen2021theroleof pages 29-32).
