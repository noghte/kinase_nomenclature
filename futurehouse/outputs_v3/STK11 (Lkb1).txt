1. Phylogeny  
STK11, commonly known as LKB1, is an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine kinase that belongs to the AMPK‐related (also termed CAMKL) family of kinases. Its orthologs are found throughout eukaryotes, from lower organisms to mammals, underscoring its central role in regulating energy homeostasis and cell polarity. LKB1 is grouped with other key members of the energy‐sensing kinome, which includes kinases such as AMPK and NUAK as well as the salt‐inducible kinases and MARK family members. This evolutionary lineage, as highlighted in comparative kinome analyses, indicates that LKB1 and its downstream effectors share ancient regulatory mechanisms that trace back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes (kang2024theroleof pages 1-2, trelford2024lkb1biologyassessing pages 1-2, faisal2020developmentandtherapeutic pages 1-2).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
LKB1 catalyzes the phosphorylation of specific serine/threonine residues on its substrate proteins. The chemical reaction it drives follows the general kinase mechanism:  
  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺  
This transfer of the γ-phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of a serine or threonine residue on the substrate is essential for the activation of downstream kinases, especially those within the AMPK family (faisal2020developmentandtherapeutic pages 4-6, trelford2024lkb1biologyassessing pages 2-4).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The catalytic activity of LKB1 is dependent on the presence of divalent cations, most notably Mg²⁺, which are required to facilitate the binding of ATP within the active site. The coordination of ATP by Mg²⁺ is critical for the phosphoryl transfer reaction and is a common requirement among serine/threonine kinases (faisal2020developmentandtherapeutic pages 4-6).

4. Substrate Specificity  
LKB1 exhibits substrate specificity by targeting a conserved threonine residue located in the activation (T-) loop of AMPK-related kinases. Its phosphorylation of this key threonine residue is critical for the full enzymatic activation of substrates such as PRKAA1 (AMPKα1), PRKAA2 (AMPKα2), BRSK1, BRSK2, MARK1–MARK4, NUAK1, NUAK2, SIK1–SIK3, and SNRK. Although no single consensus motif for LKB1 has been defined independently, its action is characterized by the selection of substrates that harbor a T-loop region amenable to phosphorylation. In many cases, activation of these substrate kinases involves an established motif that includes hydrophobic and basic residues flanking the target threonine, thereby ensuring selective phosphorylation (kang2024theroleof pages 13-14, trelford2024lkb1biologyassessing pages 18-18, faisal2020developmentandtherapeutic pages 4-6).

5. Structure  
Human LKB1 is organized into three principal regions. The N-terminal domain contains a nuclear localization signal that, in isolation, would promote nuclear retention; however, in the presence of binding partners, this localization is altered. The central core of the protein is comprised of the catalytic kinase domain, which is responsible for its phosphotransferase activity and contains key features such as the ATP-binding pocket, the invariant lysine essential for catalysis, and the activation loop (T-loop) that requires phosphorylation for substrate activation. The C-terminal regulatory region harbors sites for post-translational modifications and plays an important role in modulating the kinase’s overall conformation and activity. Structurally, LKB1 functions as part of a heterotrimeric complex formed with the pseudokinase STRAD and the scaffold protein MO25. Association with these partners induces an allosteric rearrangement that locks LKB1 into its active conformation and promotes its cytoplasmic localization. Crystal structure and AlphaFold modeling studies reveal that this complex formation is essential for full kinase activity, providing insights into the arrangement of the catalytic core and the regulatory elements that modulate substrate access (kang2024theroleof pages 1-2, trelford2024lkb1biologyassessing pages 2-4, trelford2024lkb1biologyassessing pages 4-5).

6. Regulation  
The activity of LKB1 is tightly regulated by multiple mechanisms that ensure its function as a master kinase is executed only under appropriate cellular conditions. A key regulatory step is the formation of the heterotrimeric complex with STRAD and MO25, which is necessary to induce the active conformation of the kinase and drive its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. In addition to this complex formation, LKB1 undergoes a series of post-translational modifications that modulate its stability, localization, and catalytic activity. These modifications include phosphorylation at several residues—such as those found within the activation loop and regulatory regions—as well as ubiquitination and sumoylation, which can influence its degradation and signaling output. For example, phosphorylation events mediated by kinases such as PKA and p90-RSK have been implicated in both the activation and inhibition of LKB1, depending on the specific sites modified. Ubiquitination of LKB1 by E3 ligases may target it for proteasomal degradation, thereby down-regulating its function in certain contexts. Collectively, these regulatory mechanisms allow LKB1 to integrate signals from cellular energy status and stress, thereby modulating the activity of its downstream substrates in a context-dependent manner (trelford2024lkb1biologyassessing pages 13-14, trelford2024lkb1biologyassessing pages 16-17).

7. Function  
LKB1 functions primarily as a tumor suppressor by acting as a key upstream regulator of a family of kinases that are central to cellular energy homeostasis and growth control. By phosphorylating the T-loop threonine residue on its substrates, LKB1 activates proteins such as AMPKα1 and AMPKα2, as well as other AMPK-related kinases including the BRSK, MARK, NUAK, SIK, and SNRK families. Activation of these kinases leads to the inhibition of anabolic signaling pathways such as mTOR, especially during energy-deprived states, and promotes catabolic processes in order to restore energy balance. Through these pathways, LKB1 inhibits signaling cascades that would otherwise promote cell growth and proliferation under low-energy conditions. In addition to its role in metabolism, LKB1 contributes to the maintenance of cell polarity, regulation of apoptosis, and DNA damage responses. It also phosphorylates non-AMPK family proteins such as STRADA and PTEN, and potentially p53, thereby extending its influence to additional pathways involved in tumor suppression and genomic stability. Expression of LKB1 is widespread, with high levels reported in tissues such as the liver and testis, consistent with its critical roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis in metabolically active organs. Its tumor suppressor activity is underscored by the observation that inactivating mutations in LKB1 are associated with inherited cancer predisposition syndromes such as Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, as well as sporadic cancers including lung and renal carcinomas (kang2024theroleof pages 14-15, trelford2024lkb1biologyassessing pages 14-15, faisal2020developmentandtherapeutic pages 1-2).

8. Other Comments  
LKB1 is also known by alternative names including Liver kinase B1 and Renal carcinoma antigen NY-REN-19, reflecting its discovery in the context of tumor suppression and cancer immunology. Although specific inhibitors that directly target LKB1 are not yet well characterized, therapeutic strategies have focused on exploiting vulnerabilities in downstream pathways, such as the LKB1-AMPK axis. Agents targeting metabolic reprogramming—such as glutaminase inhibitors and PARP inhibitors—have been investigated in tumors harboring LKB1 mutations, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer and ovarian cancers. LKB1 mutations and dysregulation are associated with poor prognosis and can confer resistance to certain therapies, making this kinase a significant focus for the development of combination treatments. As a tumor suppressor, loss or inactivation of LKB1 leads to unchecked cell growth, loss of polarity, and impaired cellular stress responses, thereby contributing to oncogenesis. The multifaceted regulation of LKB1, involving complex formation and numerous post-translational modifications, underscores its role as an integrator of metabolic and stress signals within the cell (trelford2024lkb1biologyassessing pages 19-20, kang2024theroleof pages 16-16, faisal2020developmentandtherapeutic pages 4-6, fabbro2015tenthingsyou pages 1-2).
