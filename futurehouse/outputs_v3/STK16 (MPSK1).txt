1. Phylogeny  
STK16 (also known as MPSK1, PKL12, TSF1, or hPSK) is a serine/threonine‐protein kinase that is evolutionarily conserved across eukaryotes. Orthologs of STK16 have been identified in yeast (for example, ENV7 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae) as well as in plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana, demonstrating its ancient origin and evolutionary conservation in regulation of intracellular signaling processes (guinea2006nucleocytoplasmicshuttlingof pages 1-2, manandhar2013saccharomycescerevisiaeenv7 pages 10-12). Phylogenetic analyses based on the conserved catalytic domain place STK16 within a distinct subfamily of serine/threonine kinases. Several studies have noted that it belongs to the Numb‐associated kinase (NAK) family, which is characterized by non‐canonical activation segments and membrane‐targeting lipid modifications. In particular, STK16 exhibits only about 25% sequence identity with classical kinases such as Aurora kinase A, underscoring its unique evolutionary trajectory (rangwala2022kinasesondouble pages 13-14). According to the classification schemes established by Manning et al. (2002), STK16 and its orthologs are grouped within the broader serine/threonine kinase complement; its distinct subfamily assignment reflects both its divergent primary sequence features and its conserved roles across diverse species (guinea2006nucleocytoplasmicshuttlingof pages 7-9, park2011globalanalysisof pages 2-3, thiriet2013preambletocytoplasmic pages 1-4).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
STK16 catalyzes the phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues on protein substrates by transferring the γ‐phosphate group from ATP. The overall chemical reaction can be summarized as follows:  
ATP + [protein]–(L‐serine or L‐threonine) → ADP + [protein]–(L‐serine/threonine)‐phosphate + H⁺.  
In addition, STK16 is capable of autophosphorylation, which includes phosphorylation on tyrosine residues; however, whether it phosphorylates other proteins on tyrosine is still unclear (in2014serinethreoninekinase16 pages 1-3, liu2017stk16regulatesactin pages 1-2).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The catalytic activity of STK16 is dependent upon the presence of divalent metal ions, with Mg²⁺ serving as the primary cofactor. Magnesium ions facilitate the proper coordination of ATP within the active site and stabilize the transition state during the phosphoryl-transfer reaction (wang2019serinethreonineproteinkinase pages 1-3).

4. Substrate Specificity  
STK16 phosphorylates serine/threonine residues on a range of target proteins. In vitro studies have demonstrated that its substrates include developmentally regulated GTP‐binding protein 1 (DRG1), α‐enolase (ENO1), and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E‐binding protein 1 (EIF4EBP1). Peptide library screening experiments have further delineated its substrate specificity by identifying a consensus phosphorylation motif characterized by the sequence:  
X–X–P/V/I–Φ–H/Y–T*–N/G–X–X–X,  
where ‘T*’ represents the phosphorylated threonine residue and ‘Φ’ denotes a hydrophobic amino acid. This consensus motif suggests that STK16 preferentially recognizes substrates in which a proline or a branched aliphatic residue is followed by a hydrophobic and a polar residue upstream of the phospho-threonine (in2014serinethreoninekinase16 pages 10-11, wang2019serinethreonineproteinkinase pages 3-5).

5. Structure  
STK16 is a relatively small kinase comprising 305 amino acids. The majority of its sequence forms a highly conserved catalytic kinase domain that includes the characteristic structural elements observed in serine/threonine kinases. This domain contains a glycine-rich loop that is important for ATP binding, a catalytic loop that supports phosphotransfer reactions, and an activation segment that is atypical in its architecture. Specifically, crystal studies and structural analyses have revealed that the activation loop of STK16 contains a β-sheet at its tip accompanied by a large α-helical insert, features that contribute to its constitutive catalytic activity without the need for extensive phosphorylation-based activation (rangwala2022kinasesondouble pages 13-14, wang2019serinethreonineproteinkinase pages 9-11).  
At its N-terminus, STK16 is modified by myristoylation at glycine residue 2 and palmitoylation at cysteine residues 6 and 8. These fatty acyl modifications promote its stable association with cellular membranes, particularly the Golgi apparatus (in2014serinethreoninekinase16 pages 1-3, thiriet2013cytoplasmicproteinserinethreonine pages 57-60). In addition, molecular dynamics and inhibitor‐binding studies have identified a flexible loop region spanning approximately residues 98–106 that is important for ligand interactions; key residues in this loop, such as Thr105, Pro99, Lys49, Phe101, and Asp166, have been implicated in establishing hydrogen bond networks that influence binding of small molecules (alfahad2024virtualscreeningand pages 9-12). Collectively, the overall 3D structure of STK16 features a compact catalytic core decorated with specific regulatory and membrane-targeting elements that distinguish it from many other serine/threonine kinases.

6. Regulation  
Regulation of STK16 occurs through multiple post-translational modifications as well as through spatial dynamics within the cell. One important regulatory mechanism is autophosphorylation, which predominantly occurs on threonine residues within the catalytic domain; in addition, STK16 is capable of autophosphorylation on a tyrosine residue, although the extent to which this contributes to its activity toward other substrates remains to be fully elucidated (liu2017stk16regulatesactin pages 1-2, in2014serinethreoninekinase16 pages 1-3).  
Furthermore, the N-terminal lipid modifications—namely myristoylation and palmitoylation—play essential roles in mediating the subcellular localization of STK16 to the Golgi apparatus. Under conditions where Golgi integrity is compromised (for instance, upon treatment with brefeldin A), STK16 translocates to the nucleus in a manner that is independent of its catalytic function; this nucleocytoplasmic shuttling is thought to contribute to regulatory feedback in cellular signaling pathways (guinea2006nucleocytoplasmicshuttlingof pages 9-10, thiriet2013preambletocytoplasmic pages 7-11).  
In addition to these modifications, protein turnover represents an important regulatory axis for STK16. Recent experiments have demonstrated that STK16 undergoes regulated degradation via the ubiquitin–proteasome system, a process mediated by the adapter protein KCTD17. This degradation pathway has been linked to physiological processes such as the sleep–wake cycle in the hypothalamus, where fluctuations in STK16 protein levels are observed (tanaka2022degradationofstk16 pages 1-2, tanaka2022degradationofstk16 pages 6-8).

7. Function  
STK16 functions as a membrane-associated kinase that is involved in several key intracellular processes. Its primary catalytic activity—phosphorylation of serine/threonine residues on substrates—has been demonstrated in vitro using proteins such as DRG1, ENO1, and EIF4EBP1, indicating its role in the direct regulation of protein function via modification (in2014serinethreoninekinase16 pages 1-3).  
Localization studies have consistently shown that STK16 is predominantly associated with the Golgi apparatus; its membrane-targeting, driven by N-terminal acylation, is critical for maintaining proper Golgi function and facilitating the sorting of secretory vesicles through the trans-Golgi network (guinea2006nucleocytoplasmicshuttlingof pages 1-2, wang2019serinethreonineproteinkinase pages 7-9).  
In addition, STK16 plays a role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Experimental data indicate that modulation of STK16 activity affects actin polymerization and depolymerization dynamics, which in turn impact Golgi organization and cell cycle progression. Such effects on actin dynamics have been observed as alterations in cell division parameters, including changes in mitotic progression and cytokinesis (liu2017stk16regulatesactin pages 6-8, liu2017stk16regulatesactin pages 15-16).  
Other functional roles attributed to STK16 include its involvement in TGF‐β signaling pathways and possible regulation of stromal‐epithelial interactions during ductal morphogenesis in the mammary gland. Moreover, STK16 has been implicated in the regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, thereby linking its activity to angiogenic control and the modulation of tumor vascularization (in2014serinethreoninekinase16 pages 13-14, guinea2006nucleocytoplasmicshuttlingof pages 9-10).

8. Other Comments  
Several selective inhibitors targeting STK16 have been reported for experimental purposes. Notably, STK16-IN-1 has been shown to effectively inhibit its kinase activity in vitro, providing a valuable tool for dissecting its cellular roles (liu2017stk16regulatesactin pages 8-10, rangwala2022kinasesondouble pages 24-25). In addition, regulated turnover of the STK16 protein via ubiquitination mediated by KCTD17 indicates that its steady-state levels are subject to control by the ubiquitin–proteasome system, a mechanism that may have broader implications in circadian regulation within the hypothalamus (tanaka2022degradationofstk16 pages 1-2, tanaka2022degradationofstk16 pages 6-8). Although no direct clinical associations have yet been firmly established, the involvement of STK16 in processes such as cell cycle control, intracellular vesicle trafficking, and VEGF-mediated angiogenesis suggests its potential relevance in oncogenic contexts and as a candidate sensitizer to mitotic chemotherapies (guinea2006nucleocytoplasmicshuttlingof pages 9-10, in2014serinethreoninekinase16 pages 13-14).
