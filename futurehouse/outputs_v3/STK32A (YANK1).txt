1. Phylogeny  
STK32A, also known as YANK1 or Yet Another Novel Kinase 1, belongs to the small STK32 subfamily within the highly diverse AGC kinase family, a group that originated early in eukaryotic evolution and can be traced back to the common ancestor of opisthokonts (sorrell2020stk32aisa pages 1-5). STK32A is the most ancient member of its family, with orthologs detected in diverse eukaryotic lineages including fungi such as Magnaporthe oryzae, Neurospora crassa, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, while its paralogs STK32B and STK32C appear to have emerged later in evolution, with STK32C being restricted to bony vertebrates (sorrell2020stk32aisa pages 5-7). The protein shares a conserved kinase catalytic domain with distinct features when compared to other AGC kinases, and its relatively low overall sequence identity (approximately 36% to the closest non-STK32 kinases) highlights its unique evolutionary trajectory (sorrell2020stk32aisa pages 1-5). Comparative phylogenetic analyses, as originally formulated by Manning and co-workers for the human kinome, place STK32A within the AGC branch that includes related kinases such as PKB/Akt and PKA; however, the STK32 subfamily forms a discrete clade with specialized functional and structural characteristics (sorrell2020stk32aisa pages 1-5).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
STK32A catalyzes the ATP-dependent transfer of a phosphate group to hydroxyl groups of amino acid residues on substrate proteins, thereby phosphorylating serine, threonine, and, in dual-specificity fashion, tyrosine residues (sorrell2020stk32aisa pages 7-10). The enzymatic reaction can be summarized as follows:  
  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine, L-threonine, or L-tyrosine) → ADP + [protein]-(phospho-serine/threonine/tyrosine) + H⁺ (sorrell2020stk32aisa pages 7-10).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The catalytic activity of STK32A is dependent on the presence of ATP as the phosphate donor and requires divalent metal ions for activity, with Mg²⁺ being a principal cofactor under standard assay conditions; in certain experimental settings, manganese ions (Mn²⁺) have been shown to enhance autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation efficiency (sorrell2020stk32aisa pages 7-10).

4. Substrate Specificity  
STK32A exhibits a pronounced preference for substrate peptides that are enriched in acidic residues, with substrate specificity studies demonstrating that acidic amino acids—particularly aspartate and glutamate—at positions P–4, P+1, P+2, and P+3 relative to the phosphorylated residue contribute to efficient phosphorylation (sorrell2020stk32aisa pages 5-7). Phosphorylation assays using synthetic peptides derived from dephosphorylated HeLa cell lysates have confirmed that STK32A preferentially targets substrates with acidic motifs, a feature that distinguishes it from many other AGC kinases with basic substrate preferences (sorrell2020stk32aisa pages 7-10). In addition, the dual-specificity nature of STK32A allows it to catalyze phosphorylation on tyrosine residues in substrates that may present both serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation sites (sorrell2020stk32aisa pages 12-15).

5. Structure  
The three-dimensional structure of STK32A has been elucidated using X-ray crystallography in complex with the nonspecific kinase inhibitor staurosporine, and subsequent small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analyses have provided corroborative insights into its solution conformation (sorrell2020stk32aisa pages 10-12). STK32A adopts the canonical AGC kinase fold, consisting of an N-terminal lobe that is predominantly composed of β-strands and an α-helix (C-helix), and a larger, predominantly helical C-terminal lobe that forms the substrate binding region (sorrell2020stk32aisa pages 10-12). A unique structural feature of STK32A is the presence of a novel alpha-helical element located between the turn motif and the hydrophobic motif within its C-terminal extension; this “HF motif helix” is thought to contribute to the stabilization of the active conformation and to underlie the enzyme’s distinctive substrate preference (sorrell2020stk32aisa pages 12-15). The ATP-binding pocket of STK32A is characterized by a notably small gatekeeper residue, Val100, which creates a more spacious catalytic cleft; this feature not only accommodates bulky inhibitors such as 1NM-PP1 but also distinguishes STK32A from many other human kinases that typically possess larger hydrophobic gatekeeper residues (sorrell2020stk32aisa pages 12-15, sorrell2020stk32aisa pages 29-39). Furthermore, despite the conservation of essential catalytic residues such as lysine, glutamate, and aspartate in motifs required for ATP binding and phosphate transfer, the region corresponding to the canonical hydrophobic motif in other AGC kinases is altered in STK32A, lacking the typical phosphorylatable serine/threonine residue and instead possessing a noncanonical F–X–X–F–N–R sequence (sorrell2020stk32aisa pages 43-47).

6. Regulation  
Regulatory control of STK32A is achieved in part through autophosphorylation, as the kinase is capable of self-phosphorylating multiple residues on serine, threonine, and tyrosine sites in vitro; autophosphorylation events are observed to be enhanced in the presence of manganese ions, suggesting that metal ion concentration can modulate catalytic activity (sorrell2020stk32aisa pages 7-10). The autophosphorylation sites identified include key residues within conserved regulatory elements such as the turn motif, which is a well-known site for regulatory phosphorylation in AGC kinases, although for STK32A the modification of this motif occurs without the need for an upstream activating kinase such as PDK1 (sorrell2020stk32aisa pages 43-47). In addition, the unusual configuration of the hydrophobic motif, which lacks the canonical phosphorylatable residue, indicates that STK32A does not rely on the typical phosphorylation-dependent interaction with the N-lobe for full activation; rather, the binding of the hydrophobic motif appears to stabilize the active conformation in a manner that is independent of additional phosphorylation events (sorrell2020stk32aisa pages 12-15). Furthermore, in vitro binding assays have demonstrated that STK32A is capable of interacting with a range of broad-spectrum kinase inhibitors, underscoring that its active conformation is accessible to small-molecule ligands and that the unique features of its ATP-binding pocket may be exploited for selective inhibition (sorrell2020stk32aisa pages 29-39).

7. Function  
STK32A functions as a dual-specificity kinase with the capacity to phosphorylate both serine/threonine and tyrosine residues, a property that is supported by biochemical assays employing both synthetic peptides and full-length protein substrates such as beta-casein and p38 MAP kinase activation loop-derived peptides (sorrell2020stk32aisa pages 7-10, sorrell2020stk32aisa pages 12-15). The substrate specificity of STK32A, with its clear preference for acidic motifs, suggests that the kinase plays a role in modulating signaling pathways that depend on the phosphorylation of proteins with acidic regions (sorrell2020stk32aisa pages 5-7). Expression studies have indicated that STK32A is highly expressed in neural and endocrine tissues and that its subcellular localization is predominantly cytoplasmic, with enrichment at the centrosome; these expression patterns imply involvement in processes such as cell cycle regulation and cytoskeletal organization (sorrell2020stk32aisa pages 5-7, sorrell2020stk32aisa pages 24-29). In addition to its catalytic activity, genetic association studies have linked alterations in the STK32A gene to various disease states, including coeliac disease, lung cancer susceptibility, and neurological conditions, while the identification of a melanoma-associated missense mutation (S89F) further underscores its clinical relevance (sorrell2020stk32aisa pages 1-5, sorrell2020stk32aisa pages 39-43). Thus, STK32A participates in signaling networks that control cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival, and its dysregulation may contribute to pathophysiological processes in diverse tissues (sorrell2020stk32aisa pages 15-18).

8. Other Comments  
Inhibitor profiling studies have demonstrated that STK32A binds multiple clinically relevant kinase inhibitors including staurosporine, ALK inhibitor ceritinib, BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib, and others that are commonly used in oncology research; this inhibitor sensitivity is attributed in part to the unique structural features of its ATP-binding site, particularly the small Val100 gatekeeper residue (sorrell2020stk32aisa pages 29-39, sorrell2020stk32aisa pages 15-18). Genetic studies have uncovered single nucleotide polymorphisms and missense mutations in STK32A, including a notable melanoma-associated S89F mutation, which may impact kinase activity and contribute to disease development (sorrell2020stk32aisa pages 1-5, sorrell2020stk32aisa pages 39-43). Although the precise physiological substrates and full spectrum of interacting partners for STK32A remain to be completely defined, its dual-specificity catalytic mechanism and preference for acidic substrates suggest roles in diverse regulatory pathways. While there is accumulating evidence for its involvement in immune function, lipid metabolism, and neurological processes, further studies are warranted to fully delineate its functions and to develop selective inhibitors that could serve as therapeutic agents (sorrell2020stk32aisa pages 12-15).
