1. Phylogeny  
Serine/threonine‐protein kinase 32B (STK32B), also designated as YANK2 or Yet Another Novel Kinase 2, is classified within the STK32 kinase family, which comprises three paralogues: STK32A, STK32B, and STK32C. This kinase family is part of the broader AGC kinase superfamily, a group of serine/threonine kinases that share a conserved kinase catalytic core and similar regulatory mechanisms. Comparative phylogenetic analyses indicate that within the STK32 family, STK32B is evolutionarily more recent than STK32A. The conservation of STK32B is evident among bilateral animals—including model organisms such as nematodes, jawless vertebrates, and certain insect species—while fungal species do not appear to maintain orthologs of this kinase (sorrell2020stk32aisa pages 1-5, sorrell2020stk32aisa pages 5-7). In addition, studies focusing on the YANK kinase subgroup highlight that STK32B is placed at a relatively high evolutionary level within its branch, suggesting that it diverged from its sibling kinases in correlation with the increasing complexity of signaling networks in metazoans (shi2024yank2activatedby pages 8-9). Early analyses of the human kinome also positioned the AGC kinases as an evolutionarily conserved core that can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes, and STK32B’s inclusion in this core set underscores its importance in supporting cellular signaling pathways that emerged during animal evolution (sorrell2020stk32aisa pages 1-5). The phylogenetic context indicates that while STK32A may be more ubiquitously distributed among a wider range of eukaryotic organisms, STK32B is specifically adapted to the signaling demands present in higher organisms, particularly those involved in neurological development and cellular proliferation (shi2024yank2activatedby pages 8-9). Genetic evidence from genome‐wide association studies, as aggregated in data platforms, further supports its classification as a kinase with a distinct evolutionary signature, with potential links to several human traits and diseases that emerged in the context of multicellular complexity (OpenTargets Search: -STK32B, arencibia2013agcproteinkinases pages 4-4).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
STK32B functions as a serine/threonine kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation reaction. In this biochemical process, the enzyme facilitates the transfer of a phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the hydroxyl group of either a serine or threonine residue on target protein substrates. The overall chemical reaction can be summarized as follows:  
  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺  
This reaction is fundamental to cellular signal transduction as it alters the biochemical properties, conformation, and interaction potential of the substrate proteins, thereby modulating their function. The catalytic activity of STK32B in phosphorylating these amino acids is central to its role in post-translational regulation of both neuronal and oncogenic signaling cascades (shi2024yank2activatedby pages 7-8).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The enzymatic activity of STK32B is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions, a common requirement among serine/threonine kinases. In particular, Mg²⁺ serves as an essential cofactor that coordinates with ATP in the active site of the kinase, ensuring proper orientation of the γ-phosphate for transfer to the acceptor hydroxyl group on the substrate. The ionic interaction provided by Mg²⁺ stabilizes the nucleotide binding and contributes to the proper formation of the transition state during catalysis. This cofactor requirement is consistent with the general mechanistic properties observed in the AGC kinase superfamily and is integral to the catalytic efficiency of STK32B (arencibia2013agcproteinkinases pages 4-4).

4. Substrate Specificity  
The substrate specificity of STK32B has been elucidated through both computational and experimental approaches. Deep learning‐coupled proximity proteomics studies have played a significant role in defining the consensus substrate motif for STK32B, also known as Brsk2 in certain contexts. These studies indicate that STK32B exhibits a distinctive sequence preference characterized by a non‐polar amino acid at the –5 position relative to the phosphoacceptor, with basic residues (arginine or lysine) at the –3 and –2 positions and acidic residues (aspartic acid or glutamic acid) at positions +1 to +3 relative to the phosphorylation site (jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 12-14). This molecular signature is indicative of an acidophilic substrate profile similar to that observed in its close homolog STK32A, where conserved substrate-binding residues—such as Arg109, Arg221, and Arg304—contribute to the recognition and stabilization of target peptides that feature these electrostatic characteristics (sorrell2020stk32aisa pages 12-15). Furthermore, in the context of glioma tumorigenesis, experimental studies have demonstrated that STK32B is capable of phosphorylating key substrates such as p70S6K at its threonine 389 activation site, an event that occurs independently of mTOR signaling (shi2024yank2activatedby pages 9-13). The defined consensus motif, therefore, provides not only a mechanistic explanation for the substrate interactions of STK32B but also a framework for understanding how its catalytic activity is directed towards substrates that play crucial roles in cellular proliferation and neuronal function. The specificity towards amino acid motifs with a non-polar, basic, and acidic arrangement offers insights into potential regulatory substrates across various cell types, reinforcing the diverse functional implications of STK32B in both normal physiology and disease states (jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 12-14).

5. Structure  
STK32B is predicted to adopt the canonical tertiary structure characteristic of AGC kinases. Although a crystallographically determined structure for STK32B is not presently available, structural insights from its closely related paralog STK32A and inhibitor profiling studies provide a substantial foundation for its inferred three-dimensional organization. The kinase domain of STK32B is expected to consist of two lobes: an N-terminal lobe predominantly formed by antiparallel β-sheets and a C-terminal lobe that is rich in α-helices. These two lobes converge to create a deep cleft that constitutes the ATP-binding pocket, an essential structural feature required for catalysis (jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 12-14). In addition, STK32B harbors the conserved catalytic motifs found in AGC kinases, including the glycine-rich loop (G-loop) at the N-terminus, the conserved DFG motif which coordinates the metal ion cofactor, and the catalytic loop that contains residues critical for the phosphate-transfer reaction. Notably, inhibitor studies have revealed that STK32B contains a small gatekeeper residue, specifically valine, in its ATP-binding pocket. The presence of this valine residue is significant because it leads to the formation of an expanded hydrophobic pocket adjacent to the nucleotide-binding site, thereby permitting binding by pyrazolopyrimidine-based inhibitors such as PP1, PP2, 1-naphthyl PP1, and CGP57380 (jester2012testingthepromiscuity pages 4-5, jester2012testingthepromiscuity pages 9-11). This structural hallmark not only differentiates STK32B from other kinases with bulkier gatekeeper residues but also presents a unique opportunity for the development of selective inhibitors.  
Further, the overall AGC kinase fold is complemented by a short C-terminal extension that typically contains a hydrophobic motif. This motif in many AGC kinases is essential for binding and stabilization of the active conformation. Although detailed experimental data specific to STK32B are currently limited, parallels drawn from STK32A suggest that STK32B likely possesses a similar C-terminal regulatory element. However, unlike classical calmodulin-dependent kinases, STK32B has been shown not to engage calmodulin, which aligns with its unique structural determinants and places it within a CAMK-related subgroup that operates independently of calcium-calmodulin regulation (shi2024yank2activatedby pages 8-9).  
The integrity of the ATP-binding site and the overall structural conformation are pivotal in maintaining kinase activity, and the conservation of key elements such as the C-helix, activation loop, and hydrophobic spine across the AGC kinase family underscores the structural and functional consistency observed in STK32B. In silico modeling and homology-based predictions reinforce that the three-dimensional architecture of STK32B comprises the essential features required for catalysis while also accommodating regulatory conformations that can be modulated through phosphorylation and interaction with small molecule inhibitors. These structural aspects, derived from inhibitor sensitivity profiles and comparative analyses with STK32A, support the classification of STK32B as an AGC kinase with distinctive features that set it apart from other serine/threonine kinases yet maintain the fundamental structural blueprint necessary for ATP-dependent phosphorylation reactions (jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 12-14, jester2012testingthepromiscuity pages 4-5).

6. Regulation  
The regulatory mechanisms controlling STK32B are predominantly mediated through phosphorylation events that modulate its enzymatic activity and protein stability. A critical aspect of STK32B regulation involves the phosphorylation of a highly conserved tyrosine residue, Y110. Research has demonstrated that the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Fyn is responsible for phosphorylating Y110, a modification that has been shown to enhance the stability of STK32B and to potentiate its oncogenic signaling in glioma cells (shi2024yank2activatedby pages 5-7). Mutation of Y110 to a non-phosphorylatable residue, such as phenylalanine, results in diminished kinase activity and reduced cell proliferation, thereby underscoring the functional importance of this modification (shi2024yank2activatedby pages 13-15).  
In addition to Fyn-mediated phosphorylation, there is evidence from proximity proteomics data that suggests involvement of other regulatory pathways. For example, phosphorylation events within the kinase’s activation loop—which may be mediated by CaMKK—contribute to conformational changes that enhance catalytic activity, even though STK32B does not interact with calmodulin directly (jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 12-14). Autophosphorylation is also posited as a contributory factor in fine-tuning the activity of STK32B, whereby the kinase self-modifies key residues to sustain an active or competent conformation required for substrate binding and catalysis.  
Moreover, STK32B’s regulation is intertwined with its cellular localization; data indicate that unlike STK32A, which predominantly localizes to centrosomes, STK32B is chiefly associated with microtubules and vesicular compartments. This subcellular distribution is critical because it dictates the enzyme’s access to specific substrates and interacting partners, thereby influencing both its basal activity and its response to external signaling cues (sorrell2020stk32aisa pages 12-15). The orchestration of these phosphorylation-dependent events, driven by both upstream kinases such as Fyn and potential autophosphorylation, constitutes a multi-layered regulatory network that ensures precise control of STK32B’s activity in both neuronal development and oncogenic processes (shi2024yank2activatedby pages 5-7, jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 20-22).

7. Function  
STK32B serves multifaceted roles in cellular physiology, participating in both neuronal development and oncogenic signaling. In the nervous system, STK32B—known in some contexts as Brain‐specific kinase 2 or Brsk2—is involved in the regulation of neuronal polarity, presynaptic vesicle clustering, and synaptic development. It achieves this by phosphorylating key substrates such as Tau and Rim1, proteins that are essential for maintaining cytoskeletal organization and the proper formation of synapses. These phosphorylation events are critical in shaping neuronal networks and ensuring the correct establishment of neuronal polarity, a process that is fundamental to proper brain development and function (jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 12-14).  
In parallel, STK32B has been implicated in cancer biology, specifically in the progression of glioma. Functional studies have revealed that STK32B phosphorylates p70S6K on threonine 389, a modification that plays a crucial role in the activation of p70S6K by an mTOR-independent mechanism. This phosphorylation event drives cell proliferation and contributes to tumorigenicity in glioma models. The oncogenic potential of STK32B is further supported by experimental evidence showing that overexpression of the kinase enhances glioma cell proliferation, colony formation, and tumor growth in vivo (shi2024yank2activatedby pages 7-8, shi2024yank2activatedby pages 9-13).  
Beyond its roles in neuronal and cancer signaling, genetic association studies have identified links between STK32B and several human phenotypes. Variants in the STK32B gene have been associated with developmental delay, autism, and intellectual disability, underscoring its significance in neurodevelopment. Genome-wide association signals have also connected STK32B to traits such as smoking initiation, mathematical ability, educational attainment, and even neurodegenerative conditions and body height. These associations suggest that STK32B is broadly involved in modulating neurodevelopmental and metabolic pathways, and they provide an impetus for further research into its precise biological functions (OpenTargets Search: -STK32B, arencibia2013agcproteinkinases pages 4-4).  
At the molecular level, STK32B’s role in catalyzing phosphorylation events impacts diverse downstream signaling pathways. For instance, the phosphorylation of p70S6K at T389 is a critical checkpoint in regulating cellular protein synthesis and growth, as p70S6K is a key mediator of translational control. In neurons, the phosphorylation of substrates such as Tau modulates microtubule stability and axonal transport, which are essential for neuron survival and function. Additionally, by interacting with a range of substrates and possibly forming regulatory complexes, STK32B contributes to the fine-tuning of intracellular signaling networks, thereby influencing processes ranging from cytoskeletal dynamics to gene expression patterns (jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 12-14, shi2024yank2activatedby pages 7-8).

8. Other Comments  
Inhibitor profiling studies have identified that STK32B exhibits a unique sensitivity to a particular subset of kinase inhibitors. Owing to the presence of its small valine gatekeeper residue, STK32B is particularly susceptible to inhibition by pyrazolopyrimidine-based compounds such as PP1, PP2, 1-naphthyl PP1, and CGP57380. This inhibitor sensitivity is not only of academic interest but also demonstrates the potential for developing selective pharmacological agents that target STK32B. Despite this promising feature, no inhibitor has yet been characterized as being entirely specific for STK32B, and further studies are needed to validate these compounds in therapeutic contexts (jester2012testingthepromiscuity pages 4-5, jester2012testingthepromiscuity pages 9-11).  
Furthermore, the genetic links to neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as to diverse traits identified in genome-wide association studies, underscore the clinical relevance of STK32B. Its involvement in both neuronal development and glioma tumorigenesis suggests that aberrant regulation of this kinase could contribute to disease phenotypes spanning from cognitive impairments to cancer progression. Although the specific molecular mechanisms connecting STK32B activity with these conditions remain to be fully elucidated, the convergence of functional, structural, and genetic data highlights its potential as a therapeutic target. In summary, the combination of inhibitor sensitivity, distinctive substrate specificity, and its dual role in neurodevelopment and oncogenesis marks STK32B as a kinase of considerable interest for future drug discovery and clinical investigation (OpenTargets Search: -STK32B, arencibia2013agcproteinkinases pages 4-4).
