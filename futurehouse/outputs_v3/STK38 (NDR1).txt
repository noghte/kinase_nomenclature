1. Phylogeny  
STK38, more commonly known as NDR1, is a serine/threonine kinase belonging to the Nuclear Dbf2-related (NDR) family, which is a subfamily within the larger AGC group of protein kinases. It is evolutionarily conserved across eukaryotes, with clear orthologs found in yeast (e.g., Dbf2p and Cbk1p), in Drosophila (e.g., Tricornered), and in Caenorhabditis elegans (e.g., SAX-1), thereby underscoring its fundamental role in cell division and morphogenesis (cornils2010functionalcharacterizationof pages 151-153). In mammals, the NDR kinase family comprises four kinases: NDR1 (STK38), NDR2 (STK38L), LATS1, and LATS2, each contributing distinct yet sometimes overlapping functions in cell cycle control and centrosome duplication (cornils2010functionalcharacterizationof pages 18-22). The presence of these kinases in diverse species indicates that they emerged early in eukaryotic evolution and are part of an ancestral signaling network that has been maintained from the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) to humans (hergovich2008mammalianndrprotein pages 1-2, fukasawa2023theroleof pages 1-2). Such deep conservation across species reveals that STK38 plays critical roles that have been refined throughout evolution to regulate key processes including cell proliferation, apoptosis, and genomic integrity (hergovich2016therolesof pages 11-12).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
STK38 functions as a serine/threonine kinase by catalyzing the transfer of the gamma‐phosphate group from ATP to hydroxyl groups on serine or threonine residues of target substrate proteins. In biochemical terms, the reaction can be summarized as:  
  ATP + [protein]–(L‐serine or L‐threonine) → ADP + [protein]–(L‐serine/threonine)‐phosphate + H⁺  
This phosphorylation reaction alters the function, localization, or stability of substrate proteins and is a common regulatory mechanism in eukaryotic signal transduction pathways (bichsel2005mechanismofactivation pages 101-105).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The catalytic activity of STK38 depends on divalent metal ions, notably Mg²⁺, which serve as essential cofactors by coordinating ATP binding and facilitating the transfer of the phosphate group (fukasawa2023theroleof pages 2-4). In addition to Mg²⁺, the kinase’s activity can be modulated indirectly by Ca²⁺ through its association with calcium-binding proteins such as S100B, which bind to the N-terminal regulatory domain of STK38 and may influence autophosphorylation events crucial for activation (fukasawa2023theroleof pages 2-4).

4. Substrate Specificity  
STK38 phosphorylates serine/threonine residues on a subset of substrates that are integral to diverse signaling networks. One well‐documented substrate is the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, which is phosphorylated at Ser146 by STK38; this post‐translational modification influences p21 stability and thereby modulates cell cycle progression (shi2012ndr1stk38potentiatesnf‐κb pages 1-2). In a regulatory capacity distinct from simple phosphorylation, STK38 functions as a negative regulator of MAP3K2 signaling by converting MAP3K2 from its phosphorylated (active) state to a non‐phosphorylated state and by inhibiting its autophosphorylation (cornils2010functionalcharacterizationof pages 153-154). Moreover, STK38 acts in a kinase‐independent manner as a ufmylation “reader” by specifically recognizing and binding to mono‐ufmylated histone H4; this recruitment facilitates the assembly of SUV39H1 at sites of DNA double‐strand breaks, thus contributing indirectly to ATM activation during the DNA damage response (fukasawa2023theroleof pages 7-8).

5. Structure  
The three‐dimensional organization of STK38 is characterized by a modular architecture typical of AGC kinases. It comprises an N-terminal regulatory (NTR) domain, a centrally located catalytic kinase domain, and a C-terminal hydrophobic motif (HM). The NTR domain is responsible for mediating interactions with adaptor proteins, particularly the MOB family members, which relieve autoinhibition and promote activation (hergovich2008mammalianndrprotein pages 1-2). The kinase domain contains all the canonical subdomains observed in serine/threonine kinases, including the ATP-binding pocket—where residue K118 is critical for ATP coordination—and the activation loop that harbors the autophosphorylation site at Ser281, essential for full catalytic activity (fukasawa2023theroleof pages 2-4). A unique feature of NDR family kinases is the presence of an insertion between subdomains VII and VIII that comprises an auto-inhibitory sequence (AIS), a cluster of basic residues that transiently block substrate access until relieved by phosphorylation and MOB binding (cornils2010functionalcharacterizationof pages 151-153, xiong2018structuralbasisfor pages 1-3). In addition, the C-terminal hydrophobic motif (phosphorylated at Thr444) is critical for proper alignment of the catalytic machinery, serving as a docking site for upstream regulatory kinases in the MST family (fukasawa2023theroleof pages 2-4, xiong2018structuralbasisfor pages 12-13). Crystal structure analyses of related NDR kinases have revealed that the activation segment in STK38 adopts an extended conformation in the inactive state, occluding substrate binding sites; phosphorylation-induced conformational changes in this loop transition the enzyme into an active state with a properly aligned catalytic spine and an ordered αC-helix (xiong2018structuralbasisfor pages 4-5, hergovich2016therolesof pages 11-12).

6. Regulation  
STK38 is subject to tight regulation via multiple interdependent mechanisms that ensure precise control of its kinase activity. One primary regulatory mechanism is multi-site phosphorylation: the kinase autophosphorylates at Ser281 within the activation loop, a modification that is essential for basal catalytic activity (cornils2010functionalcharacterizationof pages 18-22). In parallel, phosphorylation of the C-terminal hydrophobic motif at Thr444 by upstream kinases such as MST1, MST2, or MST3 further potentiates its activity (fukasawa2023theroleof pages 2-4, martin2021thestk38–xpo1axis pages 4-6). The binding of MOB proteins to the NTR domain is another critical regulatory step; this interaction not only facilitates autophosphorylation at the activation loop but also relieves the autoinhibitory effect conferred by the AIS located within the kinase domain (hergovich2008mammalianndrprotein pages 1-2, hergovich2016therolesof pages 11-12). In addition, the protein phosphatase PP2A plays a counteracting role by dephosphorylating both the activation loop and hydrophobic motif, thereby returning the enzyme to an inactive state (fukasawa2023theroleof pages 4-6). Regulatory inputs from other kinases also influence STK38: for instance, GSK-3 phosphorylates residues in the N-terminal region (S6 and T7), which act as negative regulatory modifications that can be reversed upon AKT activation in response to oxidative stress (fukasawa2023theroleof pages 4-6). Beyond its kinase function, STK38 also serves as a molecular sensor in the DNA damage response. In this capacity, it recognizes mono-ufmylated histone H4 via a specific binding interface and, independent of its catalytic activity, recruits SUV39H1 to sites of double-strand breaks; this recruitment triggers downstream events leading to ATM activation (fukasawa2023theroleof pages 7-8). Thus, the regulation of STK38 integrates phosphorylation, protein–protein interactions, and post-translational modifications to finely balance its role in cell cycle progression, stress response, and DNA repair (martin2021thestk38–xpo1axis pages 7-9).

7. Function  
STK38 exerts a variety of biological functions that are central to maintaining cellular homeostasis. During normal cell cycle progression, STK38 contributes to centrosome duplication, mitotic exit, and chromosome alignment; these events are crucial for genomic stability and proper cell division (cornils2010functionalcharacterizationof pages 9-14, hergovich2008mammalianndrprotein pages 2-3). One of its pivotal roles is as a negative regulator of MAP3K2 signaling: STK38 converts MAP3K2 from its phosphorylated, active form to a non-phosphorylated state and simultaneously inhibits its autophosphorylation. This modulation of MAP3K2 activity serves to temper downstream MAP kinase cascades and maintain balanced cellular proliferation and stress responses (cornils2010functionalcharacterizationof pages 153-154). In the context of the DNA damage response, STK38 functions as a ufmylation “reader” by specifically binding to mono-ufmylated histone H4; this interaction promotes the recruitment of the histone methyltransferase SUV39H1, which in turn catalyzes the trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 9 (H3K9me3) at double-strand break sites. The ensuing chromatin modification facilitates the activation of the ATM kinase—a master regulator of the DNA damage signaling network—thereby linking STK38 to pathways that safeguard genomic integrity (fukasawa2023theroleof pages 7-8, fukasawa2023theroleof pages 6-7). Moreover, STK38 plays a role in NF-κB signaling by potentiating TNFα-induced activation of this transcription factor; its kinase activity is essential for phosphorylating components such as p21 at Ser146, which contributes to the modulation of cellular responses to inflammatory stimuli (shi2012ndr1stk38potentiatesnf‐κb pages 1-2). In addition, by influencing key regulators such as Cyclin D1 and MYC, STK38 is implicated in cell cycle control and proliferative signaling, with alterations in its expression or activity contributing to oncogenic processes—particularly as aberrations in centrosome duplication and cell cycle checkpoints may lead to tumorigenesis (hergovich2016therolesof pages 1-3, cornils2010functionalcharacterizationof pages 158-160). Therefore, STK38 functions as an integrator of signals from growth factors, stress stimuli, and DNA damage, ensuring coordinated regulation of cell division, apoptosis, and repair mechanisms.

8. Other Comments  
Dysregulation of STK38 has been associated with several pathological states, most notably in various cancers. Its role as a negative regulator of MAP3K2 signaling and as a modulator of centrosome duplication underscores its function as a tumor suppressor; indeed, perturbations in STK38 activity can lead to centrosome amplification, genomic instability, and aberrant NF-κB signaling, which are hallmarks of malignant transformation (cornils2010functionalcharacterizationof pages 158-160, fukasawa2023theroleof pages 7-8). In the context of the DNA damage response, STK38’s ability to bind mono-ufmylated histone H4 and recruit SUV39H1 is particularly important, as it triggers ATM activation and influences cellular sensitivity to ionizing radiation; this has potential implications for strategies in radiosensitization during cancer therapy (fukasawa2023theroleof pages 4-6). Although selective chemical inhibitors for STK38 have not been as extensively characterized as those for other kinases, its unique regulatory features—namely, the integration of phosphorylation-dependent activation and ufmylation-dependent chromatin interactions—make it an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Continued research into the structural basis of STK38 regulation, including the conformational changes associated with MOB protein binding and hydrophobic motif phosphorylation, may provide a framework for the discovery of novel inhibitors that can modulate its activity in disease settings (martin2021thestk38–xpo1axis pages 11-12). In addition to its kinase activity, STK38’s capacity to function as a ufmylation “reader” highlights a dual role in cell signaling that is not solely dependent on catalysis; this multifaceted regulation may allow for selective targeting of its non-kinase functions in pathological conditions where distinct aspects of its signaling output are aberrant (fukasawa2023theroleof pages 11-12, shi2012ndr1stk38potentiatesnf‐κb pages 1-2). Overall, the combination of its functions in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, DNA damage response, and NF-κB signaling places STK38 at a central nexus in cellular signaling networks, with its dysregulation being a potential contributor to various cancers and other diseases.
