1. Phylogeny  
STK39, more commonly known as SPAK, is a member of the STE20 kinase family and specifically falls within the germinal center kinase (GCK) VI subfamily. Members of this subfamily are evolutionarily conserved across metazoans, with SPAK’s orthologs identifiable from lower invertebrates to mammals. Its closest paralog in mammals is OSR1, and both kinases share high sequence identity within their catalytic domains. Phylogenetic analyses of the human kinome, as detailed in the seminal works by Manning et al., have grouped SPAK together with other STE20 family kinases that regulate stress responses and ion transport pathways. Furthermore, comprehensive profiling of the STE20 kinase family demonstrates that SPAK forms part of an evolutionarily ancient signaling module that includes upstream WNK kinases and downstream effectors such as cation-chloride cotransporters, and these proteins trace their ancestry back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes (murthy2017wnksignallingpathways pages 1-3, miller2019comprehensiveprofilingof pages 27-28).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
SPAK functions as an effector serine/threonine protein kinase. The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of the γ-phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins. In biochemical terms, the reaction can be represented as:  
  ATP + protein-(L‑serine/L‑threonine) → ADP + protein-(L‑serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺.  
This phosphorylation event alters the conformation, activity or interactions of substrate proteins and is central to the modulation of ion transporter activity in tissues sensitive to electrolyte balance (murthy2017wnksignallingpathways pages 1-3, miller2019comprehensiveprofilingof pages 28-29).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
Like most protein kinases, SPAK requires divalent metal ions for its catalytic activity. In particular, Mg²⁺ acts as a crucial cofactor that coordinates with ATP to properly position the phosphate groups within the active site of the enzyme. The presence of Mg²⁺ is essential to promote the transfer of the phosphate moiety, and without this metal ion, the phosphoryl-transfer reaction would not proceed efficiently (murthy2017wnksignallingpathways pages 1-3, miller2019comprehensiveprofilingof pages 2-3).

4. Substrate Specificity  
SPAK exhibits substrate specificity that is dictated both by the amino acid sequence surrounding the target phosphorylation site and by its ability to dock with substrates via conserved protein–protein interaction motifs. A key determinant of its substrate specificity is the recognition of a conserved RFX[V/I] motif; this docking motif is present in proteins that interact with SPAK, including upstream WNK kinases as well as downstream ion cotransporter substrates. SPAK phosphorylates several ion cotransporters such as the Na⁺–K⁺–2Cl⁻ cotransporters (NKCC1 and NKCC2) and the Na⁺–Cl⁻ cotransporter (NCC); in some cases, it also modulates members of the potassium-chloride cotransporter family (KCC2 and KCC3). Although detailed consensus phosphorylation site data are still emerging, it is clear that the RFX[V/I] docking motif plays a pivotal role in aligning substrates for efficient phosphorylation by SPAK (murthy2017wnksignallingpathways pages 3-4, miller2019comprehensiveprofilingof pages 29-30).

5. Structure  
SPAK is organized into several distinct domains that work cooperatively to mediate its kinase activity and substrate interactions. At its core, SPAK contains a centrally located N-terminal kinase domain that adopts a bilobal structure typical of protein kinases, with a smaller N-terminal lobe that primarily binds ATP via a glycine-rich loop and a larger C-terminal lobe that participates in substrate binding and catalysis. A unique feature of SPAK is the presence of an N-terminal proline–alanine-rich region, often referred to as the PAPA box, which is not found in its close homolog OSR1. In addition to the catalytic domain, SPAK possesses two conserved regulatory regions located in its C-terminal portion: the S-motif (or PF1 domain) and the CCT domain (also known as the PF2 domain). The S-motif is involved in binding to the scaffolding protein MO25, which is essential for full enzymatic activation, while the CCT domain facilitates specific docking interactions with proteins harboring RFX[V/I] motifs, including upstream WNK kinases and downstream substrates. Structural studies, including those employing crystallographic and computational approaches as reviewed in comprehensive kinase profiling, have revealed that the kinase domain contains hallmark features such as the catalytic loop (often described by the HRDLKxxN sequence), the DFG motif located at the beginning of the activation loop, and a conserved C-helix that is critical for the formation of the active site. In some structural models, SPAK has been observed to form domain-swapped dimers, which may further influence its catalytic activity and regulatory interactions (miller2019comprehensiveprofilingof pages 27-28, murthy2017wnksignallingpathways pages 4-6).

6. Regulation  
The activity of SPAK is tightly regulated by multiple mechanisms that ensure precise control over ion transport processes. A central regulatory event is the phosphorylation of a conserved threonine residue within the activation loop (reported in some studies as Thr233 in humans) by upstream WNK kinases. This phosphorylation induces a conformational change that transitions SPAK from a low-activity state to a fully active conformation. The binding of the scaffolding protein MO25 to the S-motif further potentiates SPAK activity by stabilizing the active conformation of the kinase domain. In addition, the CCT domain mediates docking interactions that are critical for both the recruitment of activating kinases (WNKs) and the binding of substrate proteins. This dual docking mechanism not only ensures efficient phosphorylation of target substrates but also contributes to the spatial and temporal regulation of signaling within the broader WNK-SPAK/OSR1 cascade. Post-translational modifications, such as autophosphorylation, may also play a role in fine-tuning SPAK activity, although the predominant mode of regulation appears to involve phosphorylation by WNK kinases and subsequent interaction with MO25 (murthy2017wnksignallingpathways pages 14-15, miller2019comprehensiveprofilingof pages 29-30).

7. Function  
SPAK functions as a pivotal effector kinase within the WNK-SPAK/OSR1 signaling cascade, which is integral to the regulation of ion transport and overall electrolyte homeostasis. Following activation by upstream WNK kinases, SPAK phosphorylates a variety of ion cotransporters that control the movement of Na⁺, K⁺, and Cl⁻ ions across cellular membranes. Among its primary substrates are the sodium–potassium–chloride cotransporters NKCC1 and NKCC2, as well as the sodium–chloride cotransporter (NCC); in some tissues, it also modulates potassium–chloride cotransporters such as KCC2 and KCC3. The phosphorylation events mediated by SPAK promote activation of these transporters, thereby regulating processes such as salt reabsorption in the kidney, volume regulation in neurons, and the contractility of vascular smooth muscle. SPAK is also implicated in the cellular response to hypertonic stress, where it plays an essential role in the regulatory volume increase by modulating the activity of key ion transporters. In many salt-sensitive tissues, these regulatory actions are critical for maintaining blood pressure and fluid balance, and dysregulation of SPAK activity has been associated with hypertensive disorders. Through its interactions with both upstream activators and multiple downstream effectors, SPAK serves as a central node in a signaling network that integrates extracellular stress signals and intracellular chloride levels to coordinate adaptive responses in ion homeostasis (murthy2017wnksignallingpathways pages 1-3, murthy2017wnksignallingpathways pages 3-4, miller2019comprehensiveprofilingof pages 28-29).

8. Other Comments  
In addition to its established roles in electrolyte and blood pressure regulation, SPAK has attracted considerable attention as a potential therapeutic target. Several small-molecule inhibitors have been identified that disrupt the interactions between SPAK’s CCT domain and its binding partners, thereby attenuating its ability to phosphorylate downstream ion cotransporters. These inhibitors, which have been discovered using assays that measure changes in phosphorylation events and substrate docking, offer potential strategies for the treatment of hypertension and other disorders related to electrolyte imbalance. Moreover, mutations and dysregulation within the WNK-SPAK/OSR1 signaling cascade have been linked to various disease phenotypes, including familial forms of hypertension and salt-wasting syndromes. Although the majority of evidence supporting these associations comes from studies of the broader signaling pathway, the central role of SPAK in mediating ion transporter activation underscores its suitability as a drug target. Current research efforts continue to focus on developing more potent and selective inhibitors that can modulate SPAK activity without affecting other kinases in the STE20 family, thus minimizing off-target effects (murthy2017wnksignallingpathways pages 14-15, murthy2017wnksignallingpathways pages 20-20, miller2019comprehensiveprofilingof pages 27-28).
