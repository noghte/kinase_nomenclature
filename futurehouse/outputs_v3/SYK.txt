1. Phylogeny  
Tyrosine‐protein kinase SYK is a member of the Syk family of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases and, together with the closely related kinase ZAP‑70, represents an evolutionarily conserved branch of the tyrosine kinome in metazoans (bradshaw2010thesrcsyk pages 2-3). Orthologs of SYK have been identified across a wide range of species, from mammals to lower invertebrates, reflecting its presence in an ancient signaling module that emerged early during animal evolution (mocsai2010thesyktyrosine pages 1-2). In vertebrates, the Syk family is comprised principally of two paralogous proteins, SYK and ZAP‑70, with both proteins sharing a similar modular organization yet displaying distinct tissue expression profiles that correspond to different immune lineages (sada2001structureandfunction pages 1-2). In lower organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster, a related Syk‐like kinase termed SHARK has been described, illustrating that the core features of the Syk family have been preserved from insects to mammals (bradshaw2010thesrcsyk pages 2-3, mocsai2010thesyktyrosine pages 1-2). This phylogenetic conservation places SYK among an ancient and critical arm of immune–receptor signaling, and it forms part of a broader kinome that expanded significantly after the emergence of multicellularity (santos2016paralogspecificpatternsof pages 19-20, shah2018thesrcmodule pages 1-3).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
SYK catalyzes the transfer of the γ‐phosphate from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the hydroxyl group of tyrosine residues on substrate proteins, producing ADP, a phosphorylated tyrosine residue, and a proton (mocsai2010thesyktyrosine pages 1-2). This ATP‐dependent phosphorylation reaction is the fundamental catalytic process by which SYK relays and amplifies signals downstream of activated transmembrane receptors (taft2017ayeastbasedassay pages 13-22).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The catalytic activity of SYK depends on the presence of essential cofactors, most notably divalent metal ions such as Mg²⁺, which coordinate with ATP to facilitate the transfer of phosphate groups to substrate tyrosine residues (sada2001structureandfunction pages 1-2, taft2017ayeastbasedassay pages 13-22). The requirement for Mg²⁺ is typical of protein tyrosine kinases, and this cofactor is critical for binding ATP in a catalytically productive conformation (taft2017ayeastbasedassay pages 13-22).

4. Substrate Specificity  
SYK exhibits intrinsic substrate specificity characterized by its preferential phosphorylation of tyrosine residues within immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) that are present either as part of receptor subunits or within adapter proteins (bradshaw2010thesrcsyk pages 2-3, mocsai2010thesyktyrosine pages 1-2). The tandem SH2 domains of SYK recognize and bind to dually phosphorylated ITAM sequences, ensuring that its catalytic activity is directed toward substrates that participate in immune signaling complexes (mocsai2010thesyktyrosine pages 3-4, sada2001structureandfunction pages 3-3). In addition to classical ITAMs, SYK phosphorylates a series of downstream effectors, including the adapters BLNK (also known as SLP‑65 or BASH), LCP2, and VAV1, as well as effector enzymes such as phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLCG1) and the p110 catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide 3‑kinase (PI‑3‑kinase) (bradshaw2010thesrcsyk pages 7-9, mocsai2010thesyktyrosine pages 12-14). Comprehensive analysis of the intrinsic substrate specificities for the human tyrosine kinome has revealed that SYK displays a distinct preference for substrate motifs that include surrounding acidic residues, although a singular consensus sequence is not strictly enforced (yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 2-2).

5. Structure  
The modular architecture of SYK is defined by an N‑terminal region containing two tandem Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, followed by interdomain regions that include a unique insert, and a C‑terminal catalytic kinase domain (bradshaw2010thesrcsyk pages 2-3, sada2001structureandfunction pages 1-2). Specifically, the tandem SH2 domains, which are critical for binding to phosphorylated ITAM motifs, are connected by an inter-SH2 linker that, in the case of full-length SYK (often referred to as p72‑SYK), contains a unique 23 amino acid insert not found in the closely related ZAP‑70, contributing to differences in receptor binding and signaling efficacy (bradshaw2010thesrcsyk pages 2-3, sada2001structureandfunction pages 3-3). The C‑terminal kinase domain harbors key catalytic features—including the activation loop, wherein tyrosines such as Tyr525 and Tyr526 are positioned and undergo autophosphorylation to enhance catalytic activity, as well as a conserved DFG motif and a C‑helix that are critical for assembly of the regulatory hydrophobic spine (mocsai2010thesyktyrosine pages 10-12, sada2001structureandfunction pages 3-4). Structural models derived from crystallographic studies and computational approaches such as AlphaFold have provided insight into the three‑dimensional arrangement of these domains, revealing a configuration in which the tandem SH2 domains are poised to interact with phosphorylated receptor motifs, thereby relieving autoinhibitory interactions within the kinase domain (mocsai2010thesyktyrosine pages 3-4, sada2001structureandfunction pages 4-5). In addition, alternative splicing produces isoforms such as SykB, which lacks the unique 23 amino acid insert in the inter‑SH2 region and displays altered substrate binding and signaling properties (sada2001structureandfunction pages 3-3, bradshaw2010thesrcsyk pages 2-3).

6. Regulation  
Regulatory mechanisms governing SYK activity are mediated primarily by phosphorylation events as well as by interactions with receptor complexes and adaptor proteins. In quiescent cells, SYK exists in an autoinhibited state maintained by intramolecular interactions among its SH2 domains, interdomain regions, and the kinase domain (bradshaw2010thesrcsyk pages 3-5, mocsai2010thesyktyrosine pages 12-12). Engagement of immunoreceptors leads to the phosphorylation of ITAMs by Src family kinases such as Lyn, which in turn enables the recruitment of SYK via its tandem SH2 domains, triggering a conformational change that relieves the autoinhibitory constraints (bradshaw2010thesrcsyk pages 2-3, mocsai2010thesyktyrosine pages 2-3). Upon membrane recruitment, SYK undergoes autophosphorylation on several key tyrosine residues, including those within the linker region (Tyr348 and Tyr352) and the activation loop (Tyr525 and Tyr526), thereby stabilizing its active conformation and promoting full catalytic activity (bradshaw2010thesrcsyk pages 3-5, sada2001structureandfunction pages 2-3). In addition, phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue near the C‑terminus (Tyr630), which is unique to SYK, further disrupts autoinhibitory interactions, augmenting downstream signaling (mocsai2010thesyktyrosine pages 12-14). Regulation is further modulated by protein phosphatases such as SHP‑1 and CD45, which dephosphorylate SYK, and by ubiquitin ligases including c‑Cbl that target the kinase for proteasomal degradation (sada2001structureandfunction pages 5-6, mocsai2010thesyktyrosine pages 12-14). Additionally, alternative splicing generating isoforms like SykB contributes to differential regulatory properties and signal propagation (sada2001structureandfunction pages 3-3).

7. Function  
SYK functions as a central mediator of signal transduction downstream of a variety of immunoreceptors, including the B‑cell receptor (BCR), T‑cell receptor (TCR), Fc receptors, and C‑type lectin receptors present on cells of the innate immune system (bradshaw2010thesrcsyk pages 2-3, mocsai2010thesyktyrosine pages 1-2). Upon engagement of these receptors, Src family kinases phosphorylate ITAM motifs, thereby creating docking sites for the tandem SH2 domains of SYK; this recruitment initiates a cascade of phosphorylation events (bradshaw2010thesrcsyk pages 2-3, sada2001structureandfunction pages 3-4). The activated SYK phosphorylates numerous downstream substrates, including key adaptor proteins such as BLNK/SLP‑65, LCP2, and VAV1, as well as enzymes like PLCG1 and components of the PI‑3‑kinase complex, to propagate signals that regulate cellular processes such as calcium mobilization, cytoskeletal reorganization, and MAP kinase activation (mocsai2010thesyktyrosine pages 12-14, sada2001structureandfunction pages 3-4). Consequently, SYK plays critical roles in both adaptive and innate immunity, modulating processes that include B‑cell development, antibody production, mast cell degranulation, osteoclast maturation, platelet activation, and vascular development (bradshaw2010thesrcsyk pages 7-9, mocsai2010thesyktyrosine pages 16-16, patterson2015arespiratorychain pages 7-8). The integration of signals from multiple receptors by SYK ensures a coordinated cellular response that is essential for immune surveillance and tissue homeostasis (sada2001structureandfunction pages 7-8).

8. Other Comments  
A number of small molecule inhibitors have been developed to target SYK and modulate its signaling in pathological conditions; among these, fostamatinib, entospletinib, TAK659, and GSK986310C have been evaluated in preclinical and clinical settings for the treatment of autoimmune disorders and hematological malignancies (reinecke2024chemicalproteomicsreveals pages 4-5). Furthermore, fusion proteins in which the catalytic domain of SYK is linked to N‑terminal domains from TEC family kinases (such as ITK‑SYK and BTK‑SYK) or from ETS transcription factors (TEL‑SYK) have been characterized; these chimeric proteins exhibit constitutive kinase activity and distinct subcellular localization patterns, with ITK‑SYK in particular displaying activation‑inducible nuclear translocation (hamasy2025differentialregulatoryeffects pages 7-9). The aberrant activation of SYK or the formation of fusion kinases is associated with oncogenic transformation and has been implicated in rare hematologic malignancies, including peripheral T‑cell lymphomas and myelodysplastic syndromes (hamasy2025differentialregulatoryeffects pages 2-3, mocsai2010thesyktyrosine pages 12-14). Additionally, dysregulated SYK signaling has been linked to defects in immune complex handling and inflammatory responses, underscoring its importance not only in normal physiology but also in disease (mocsai2010thesyktyrosine pages 16-16, sada2001structureandfunction pages 9-10). Isoform variability through alternative splicing, which generates variants such as SykB that lack the unique inter‑SH2 domain insert, further contributes to the functional diversity observed in different cellular contexts (sada2001structureandfunction pages 3-3). Collectively, the development and characterization of selective inhibitors, along with detailed studies of SYK fusion proteins, have provided important molecular tools for dissecting SYK function and identifying potential therapeutic avenues (reinecke2024chemicalproteomicsreveals pages 4-5, hamasy2025differentialregulatoryeffects pages 7-9).
