1. Phylogeny  
TAOK1 (also referred to as TAO1, KIAA1361, MAP3K16, or MARKK) belongs to the STE20 kinase subfamily within the human kinome. Its evolutionary conservation is evident by the presence of orthologs in diverse species, ranging from invertebrates such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster to vertebrates including rodents, fish, and humans (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 1-3, nourbakhsh2021uncoveringtherole pages 44-49). Within the broader context of kinase evolution, TAOK1 shares strong sequence homology in its N-terminal kinase domain with its paralogs TAOK2 and TAOK3, although the regulatory regions display divergence that likely underpins their distinct cellular functions (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 3-4, byeon2024pleiotropicfunctionsof pages 1-3). This phylogenetic context places TAOK1 among kinases that have maintained a core signaling role through evolution while acquiring specialized functions in neural development and stress responses (hu2021clinicalandneurobiological pages 1-2).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
TAOK1 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to specific serine or threonine residues on its substrate proteins. In this reaction, ATP and the substrate protein yield ADP and a phosphorylated substrate protein. This enzymatic reaction can be generally summarized as:  
  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 6-7).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The kinase activity of TAOK1 depends on the presence of divalent metal ions as cofactors. In line with canonical serine/threonine kinases, TAOK1 requires Mg²⁺ ions for its catalytic function. These ions facilitate the correct positioning of ATP within the catalytic cleft, enhancing the phosphoryl transfer reaction (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 3-4).

4. Substrate Specificity  
TAOK1 phosphorylates specific target proteins involved in major signaling cascades, notably the p38/MAPK stress-activated pathway. Substrates include MAP2K3 and MAP2K6, whose activation is mediated via TAOK1-catalyzed phosphorylation, as well as MARK2, where phosphorylation at Thr208 is critical for subsequent effects on microtubule-associated proteins such as tau (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 6-7, ning2025multiomicsanalysisrevealed pages 14-16). Although a definitive consensus motif for TAOK1 substrates has not been explicitly defined in the available literature, the enzyme displays substrate specificity that aligns with its role in integrating stress signals and regulating cytoskeletal stability (byeon2024pleiotropicfunctionsof pages 12-14).

5. Structure  
TAOK1 is a large protein comprising approximately 1001 amino acids with a well-conserved domain organization. Its structure includes an N-terminal catalytic kinase domain, which is essential for phosphorylation activity, followed by several coiled-coil domains that contribute to its ability to bind membranes and potentially mediate protein–protein interactions (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 1-3, beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 3-4). Structural investigations and predictive models derived from AlphaFold2 indicate that the coiled-coil region is likely to fold into a triple helical bundle, reminiscent of certain BAR domain proteins that directly interact with phosphoinositides at the plasma membrane (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 25-26, byeon2024pleiotropicfunctionsof pages 3-4). Key catalytic features include an activation loop wherein autophosphorylation occurs – notable modifications such as phosphorylation at Thr440, Thr443, and Ser181 are crucial for modulating activity and subcellular localization (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 15-20, beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 6-7). The 3D structural organization supports its dual role in both enzymatic activity and plasma membrane remodeling, with structural elements ensuring a balance between cytosolic kinase function and membrane-associated processes (byeon2024pleiotropicfunctionsof pages 23-29).

6. Regulation  
TAOK1 regulation is achieved through multiple mechanisms that involve both autophosphorylation and interactions with regulatory proteins. Autophosphorylation events, notably at Thr440 and Thr443, play a pivotal role in controlling its plasma membrane binding and remodeling activity; phosphorylation at these sites can block membrane association, thus serving as an autoregulatory mechanism (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 25-26, byeon2024pleiotropicfunctionsof pages 7-9). Phosphorylation of Ser181 within the catalytic loop is also critical to achieving full kinase activity (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 3-4). Additionally, TAOK1 is subject to regulation by upstream signals; for example, it operates downstream of G-protein coupled receptor signaling to activate the p38/MAPK cascade during responses to DNA damage, linking its activation to cell cycle checkpoint control at the G2/M transition (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 6-7, hu2021clinicalandneurobiological pages 3-4). Modulatory phosphorylation by other kinases, such as MST3, has also been implicated in regulating TAOK1’s function in neuronal development (byeon2024pleiotropicfunctionsof pages 16-18).

7. Function  
TAOK1 plays an essential role in various biological processes due to its capacity to regulate key signaling cascades. It functions as an activator of the p38/MAPK stress-activated pathway by phosphorylating and thereby activating MAP2K3 and MAP2K6. This activity is particularly significant during cellular responses to DNA damage, where TAOK1 contributes to the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint by ensuring proper signaling through p38/MAPK14 (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 6-7, hu2021clinicalandneurobiological pages 5-6). In addition, TAOK1 phosphorylates MARK2 at Thr208, thereby activating MARK2 and promoting the phosphorylation and detachment of tau (MAPT) from microtubules. This function is central to the regulation of cytoskeletal stability, influencing neuronal morphology and potentially affecting neurite outgrowth and dendritic arborization (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 3-4, ning2025multiomicsanalysisrevealed pages 14-16). TAOK1 is highly expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in brain regions such as the neocortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum, underpinning its critical roles in neuronal development and migration (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 1-3, hu2021clinicalandneurobiological pages 2-3). Furthermore, TAOK1 influences apoptotic processes by activating the MAPK8/JNK cascade, which leads to morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis, including membrane blebbing and cell contraction (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 6-7). These functional roles integrate TAOK1 into multiple signaling networks that control neuron development, cytoskeletal regulation, stress responses, and programmed cell death (byeon2024pleiotropicfunctionsof pages 12-14).

8. Other Comments  
TAOK1 is associated with several pathologies when its normal function is disrupted. Mutations leading to catalytically inactive, membrane‐bound forms of TAOK1 have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and abnormal dendritic morphology (dulovicmahlow2019denovovariants pages 1-2, beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 3-4). Functional studies have demonstrated that the dysregulation of TAOK1’s kinase activity can cause anomalous plasma membrane remodeling, which in turn affects dendritic outgrowth and neuronal connectivity (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 15-20, dulovicmahlow2019denovovariants pages 3-4). In addition to its roles in neurodevelopment, TAOK1 has been implicated in cancer biology; multi-omics analyses indicate that TAOK1 is overexpressed in several tumor types and correlates with poor prognosis in cancers such as cervical cancer (ning2025multiomicsanalysisrevealed pages 1-2, ning2025multiomicsanalysisrevealed pages 6-9). TAOK1’s regulatory features make it a potential target for small-molecule kinase activators or inhibitors, with compounds (e.g., Compound 43 in experimental settings) shown to modulate its activity (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 3-4, byeon2024pleiotropicfunctionsof pages 29-34). TAOK1 thus emerges as a multifunctional kinase whose precise enzymatic regulation is essential for both neural integrity and broader cellular homeostasis, and whose mutation or altered expression can have significant pathological consequences (hunter2022inheritedandde pages 15-15, hu2021clinicalandneurobiological pages 4-5).
