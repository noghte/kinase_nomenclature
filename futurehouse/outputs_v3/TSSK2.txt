1. Phylogeny  
Testis-specific serine/threonine‐protein kinase 2 (TSSK2) is a member of an evolutionarily conserved family of serine/threonine kinases that are expressed exclusively in the testis. TSSK2 belongs to the TSSK family, a subgroup of kinases distinguished by their intronless gene organization and restricted expression patterns in post‐meiotic germ cells. The gene for TSSK2 appears to have arisen via retroposition, a process that gives rise to intronless retrogenes and is commonly observed in testis‐specific genes. In murine models, Tssk2 is found in a tandem arrangement with Tssk1 on mouse chromosome 16, a region syntenic to the human DiGeorge syndrome minimal region on chromosome 22; in humans, the corresponding gene is located on chromosome 22 and often found near a TSSK1 pseudogene, with an expressed paralogue designated TSSK1B located on chromosome 5. This conserved chromosomal organization and the presence of orthologs across mammalian species—including rodents and primates—underscore the essential reproductive role of TSSK2 (nayyab2025identificationoftssk1 pages 1-2, shang2014testisspecificproteinkinases pages 64-65). Moreover, phylogenetic analyses indicate that TSSK2 and its related kinases emerged early in mammalian evolution and have been maintained under strong purifying selection, particularly within their kinase domains; such conservation reflects the necessity of their catalytic functions in spermatogenesis (nayyab2025identificationoftssk1 pages 15-18, kadiyska2022roleoftestis‑specific pages 1-2). Comparisons with invertebrate homologs reveal that while a single dTssk gene is present in Drosophila melanogaster, mammalian TSSK2 exhibits only partial homology with the fly kinase, indicating functional divergence concomitant with the increased complexity of mammalian spermiogenesis (shang2010functionaltransformationof pages 1-2, nayyab2025identificationoftssk1 pages 18-19). Thus, TSSK2 is nested within a core group of testis‐specific kinases that, along with other AGC kinase family members, share ancestry dating back to early eukaryotic evolution and have been adapted to fulfill specialized reproductive roles in mammals (salicioni2020testisspecificserinekinase pages 14-15, shang2014testisspecificproteinkinases pages 133-139).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
TSSK2 catalyzes the phosphorylation of specific serine/threonine residues in target proteins, a hallmark reaction of serine/threonine kinases. In a reaction that utilizes ATP, TSSK2 transfers a gamma phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues on its substrate proteins, thereby converting ATP to ADP. The overall chemical reaction can be summarized as follows:  
  ATP + [protein]–OH → ADP + [protein]–O‐phosphate + H⁺  
This canonical phosphorylation reaction modifies the functional state of substrate proteins, often regulating protein–protein interactions, enzymatic activity, or subcellular localization. In the case of TSSK2, phosphorylation is central to the molecular remodeling events that occur during the late stages of spermiogenesis (nzi2021…àla pages 56-60). The reaction mechanism is consistent with those observed for other serine/threonine kinases and plays a critical role in the post‐translational modification of proteins involved in sperm differentiation (nayyab2025identificationoftssk1 pages 18-19).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The catalytic activity of TSSK2 is strictly dependent on the presence of divalent cations, with Mg²⁺ being the required cofactor. Mg²⁺ ions coordinate with ATP within the kinase active site to facilitate the proper positioning of the phosphate groups during catalysis. It has been shown that, unlike some related kinases that exhibit activity in the presence of Mn²⁺, TSSK2 displays negligible activity when Mn²⁺ is substituted for Mg²⁺, underscoring a specific requirement for magnesium ions (salicioni2020testisspecificserinekinase pages 15-16). The binding of Mg²⁺ not only stabilizes the ATP molecule but also plays a significant role in lowering the activation energy for the phosphotransfer reaction, ensuring efficient catalysis during spermatid maturation (nzi2021…àla pages 56-60). Therefore, the cofactor requirement for Mg²⁺ is fundamental to the kinase activity of TSSK2 and its subsequent role in phosphorylating target substrates in germ cells (salicioni2020testisspecificserinekinase pages 15-16).

4. Substrate Specificity  
TSSK2 exhibits a distinct substrate specificity that is integral to its role in spermatogenesis. One of its well‐characterized substrates is TSKS, the testis‐specific kinase substrate, which is phosphorylated at the serine residue at position 288. This phosphorylation event is crucial for the transformation of a ring‐shaped structure derived from the chromatoid body that forms around the flagellum base during the late stages of spermatid development (nayyab2025identificationoftssk1 pages 18-19). In addition, TSSK2 phosphorylates SPAG16, a protein associated with the axoneme of the sperm flagellum, thereby contributing to the regulation of flagellar structure and motility (salicioni2020testisspecificserinekinase pages 16-16). Although the precise consensus sequence or motif required for substrate recognition by TSSK2 has not been exhaustively characterized, it is evident that TSSK2 selectively targets serine/threonine residues in proteins that are pivotal for sperm cytoplasmic restructuring and flagellar assembly (nzi2021…àla pages 56-60). The substrate specificity observed for TSSK2 is further supported by in vitro kinase assays demonstrating its ability to phosphorylate bacterially produced TSKS and peptides derived from spermatogenic proteins (nayyab2025identificationoftssk1 pages 19-21). This selective reactivity ensures that only target proteins critical for the morphological changes during spermiogenesis are modified, thereby contributing to proper sperm maturation and function (shang2010functionaltransformationof pages 1-2).

5. Structure  
TSSK2 displays a three-dimensional structure common to serine/threonine kinases, featuring a conserved catalytic domain that is essential for its enzymatic activity. The kinase domain of TSSK2 typically spans the N-terminal region, approximately encompassing the first 269 amino acids. This domain includes several conserved motifs integral to the kinase’s function, such as the glycine-rich loop (G-loop), the catalytic loop, and the activation segment. A critical lysine residue (identified as K27) is located within the ATP binding pocket and is necessary for stabilizing the phosphate donor, ATP; mutagenesis studies have shown that alterations at this position severely diminish kinase activity (shang2014testisspecificproteinkinases pages 133-139). The activation loop, which is required for full catalytic activity, undergoes autophosphorylation at a key threonine residue (Thr174); this phosphorylation event is necessary to reconfigure the active site into a catalytically competent conformation (nzi2021…àla pages 56-60).  

Structural predictions, including those generated by AlphaFold, indicate that TSSK2 adopts the canonical two-lobe configuration seen in many protein kinases: an N-terminal lobe primarily composed of β-sheets, and a larger C-terminal lobe that is rich in α-helices. The interface between these lobes forms the deep cleft where ATP binds. Within this cleft, the glycine-rich loop confers flexibility, allowing for the proper accommodation of the ATP molecule, while the catalytic loop contains residues that participate directly in the transfer of the phosphate group to the substrate (shang2014testisspecificproteinkinases pages 125-126).  

In addition to the catalytic domain, TSSK2 possesses a relatively short C-terminal regulatory region; although the precise function of this region is less well defined, it is thought to contribute to substrate interactions and subcellular localization within developing spermatids. The intronless structure of the TSSK2 gene results in a streamlined primary sequence of approximately 358 amino acids and a molecular weight in the vicinity of 40–41 kDa, a profile that is typical for many testis-specific kinases. This compact structural organization may facilitate rapid translation and efficient folding within the specialized environment of the testis (salicioni2020testisspecificserinekinase pages 1-1, shang2014testisspecificproteinkinases pages 69-69).  

Notable features of the TSSK2 structure include the conservation of the catalytic core and the presence of structural elements such as the C-helix—a helical segment that helps position key catalytic residues—as well as a hydrophobic spine that stabilizes the active conformation of the kinase. Although high-resolution crystallographic data for TSSK2 are currently limited, homology modeling based on related kinases supports the presence of these structural motifs. Such conformational features are critical not only for catalytic activity but also for the potential binding of small-molecule inhibitors that target the kinase domain (shang2014testisspecificproteinkinases pages 125-126, salicioni2020testisspecificserinekinase pages 14-15). Overall, TSSK2’s structure reflects a well-adapted enzyme whose catalytic and regulatory domains cooperate to effect precise phosphorylation events during sperm development (nayyab2025identificationoftssk1 pages 1-2, shang2014testisspecificproteinkinases pages 133-139).

6. Regulation  
The regulation of TSSK2 is multifaceted and is tightly linked to its role in spermatogenesis. At the transcriptional level, TSSK2 expression is restricted exclusively to the testis and is temporally expressed during the later stages of spermatid maturation, a timing that aligns with its role in cytoplasmic restructuring and flagellum formation (nayyab2025identificationoftssk1 pages 7-9, salicioni2020testisspecificserinekinase pages 2-2). Such stringent tissue specificity minimizes off-target phosphorylation in other cell types and underscores the evolutionary pressure to maintain precise control over kinase activity in germ cells.

Post-translational regulation also plays a critical role in modulating TSSK2 activity. Autophosphorylation of the activation loop—specifically at Thr174—is essential for converting TSSK2 into an active conformation capable of efficient substrate phosphorylation. This autophosphorylation event not only facilitates catalytic activity but may also serve as a molecular switch that locks TSSK2 in an active state during critical periods of spermatid differentiation (nzi2021…àla pages 56-60). Furthermore, interactions with binding partners can influence TSSK2 function. TSKS, the testis-specific kinase substrate, forms a complex with TSSK2, suggesting that substrate recognition may in turn modulate kinase activity through feedback mechanisms that adjust the phosphorylation state of the complex components (nayyab2025identificationoftssk1 pages 19-21, shang2014testisspecificproteinkinases pages 77-81). 

In contrast to some other members of the TSSK family, such as TSSK4 and TSSK6, which display regulation via molecular chaperones like HSP90 and its associated cochaperones, TSSK2 appears to maintain its catalytic activity with relatively less sensitivity to HSP90 inhibitors. This observation suggests that although chaperone-mediated stabilization is a common regulatory mechanism among testis-specific kinases, TSSK2 may possess intrinsic structural features that allow it to achieve and maintain an active conformation independently of such external regulatory inputs (salicioni2020testisspecificserinekinase pages 16-17). Additionally, the formation of stable protein complexes during spermiogenesis, as evidenced by co-immunoprecipitation studies with TSKS and other interacting proteins, may represent another layer of regulation. These complexes are believed to facilitate spatially and temporally coordinated phosphorylation events that are necessary for the remodeling of cellular organelles, such as the transformation of the chromatoid body into a ring-shaped structure that encircles the sperm flagellum base (nayyab2025identificationoftssk1 pages 19-21, shang2010functionaltransformationof pages 2-3). 

Taken together, regulation of TSSK2 is achieved through a combination of transcriptional control, autophosphorylation-dependent activation, and protein complex formation, all of which ensure that its kinase activity is precisely modulated within the specialized environment of the testis (salicioni2020testisspecificserinekinase pages 16-17, nayyab2025identificationoftssk1 pages 7-9).

7. Function  
TSSK2 plays an indispensable role in the late stages of spermatogenesis, particularly during spermatid differentiation and maturation. Its primary function is to catalyze the phosphorylation of key substrate proteins that mediate cytoplasmic remodeling events vital for sperm development. One of the critical substrates of TSSK2 is TSKS, the testis‐specific kinase substrate, which is phosphorylated at serine residue 288. This event is required for the transformation of the chromatoid body—a cytoplasmic organelle involved in RNA processing—into a ring‐shaped structure that ultimately encircles the base of the emerging flagellum. This morphological transformation is essential for proper flagellar assembly and the formation of a stable mitochondrial sheath, both of which are key determinants of sperm motility and function (nayyab2025identificationoftssk1 pages 18-19, shang2010functionaltransformationof pages 1-2).

In addition to its role in cytoplasmic restructuring, TSSK2 also phosphorylates SPAG16, a protein that localizes to the axoneme of the sperm flagellum, suggesting a direct involvement in the regulation of flagellar function and motility (salicioni2020testisspecificserinekinase pages 16-16). Mouse knockout studies have provided compelling evidence for the functional importance of TSSK2: deletion of Tssk2—alone or in combination with Tssk1—results in pronounced male infertility characterized by abnormal sperm morphology, reduced motility, and defects in the assembly of the mitochondrial sheath (nayyab2025identificationoftssk1 pages 7-9, shang2010functionaltransformationof pages 1-2). These infertility phenotypes indicate that TSSK2 is crucial for the proper execution of the late-stage differentiation programs in spermatids.

The expression of TSSK2 is highly restricted to the testis and is confined to post-meiotic germ cells, which further emphasizes its specialized role in sperm development. In the developing testis, TSSK2 expression coincides with the period of spermatid elongation, a stage during which major morphological and biochemical changes occur. This temporal expression pattern ensures that TSSK2-mediated phosphorylation events are precisely coordinated with the remodeling processes that underpin the formation of a mature, motile spermatozoon (nayyab2025identificationoftssk1 pages 1-2, kadiyska2022roleoftestis‑specific pages 1-2).

Furthermore, TSSK2 is part of a coordinated network of kinases that work in concert during spermiogenesis. Its interaction with TSKS suggests that it may participate in feedback or feed-forward regulatory loops that ensure the sequential and spatially restricted activation of downstream pathways. Such pathways are responsible for the proper recovery of sperm head morphology, tail formation, and overall sperm function (salicioni2020testisspecificserinekinase pages 18-19, shang2014testisspecificproteinkinases pages 38-40). Collectively, these findings position TSSK2 as a central regulator of spermatid development whose enzymatic activity is essential for the generation of functional spermatozoa, making it a prime target for future interventions in male fertility (nayyab2025identificationoftssk1 pages 15-18, shang2010functionaltransformationof pages 1-2).

8. Other Comments  
Beyond its well-established role in spermatogenesis, TSSK2 is garnering considerable interest as a potential therapeutic target for non-hormonal male contraception. Its testis-specific expression minimizes the risk of off-target effects in non-reproductive tissues, and its essential function in sperm maturation makes it an ideal candidate for selective pharmacological inhibition (kadiyska2022roleoftestis‑specific pages 7-8, nayyab2025identificationoftssk1 pages 1-2). Inhibitor development efforts have led to the identification of small molecules featuring pyrrolopyrimidine and pyrimidine cores that exhibit potent inhibition of TSSK2 activity in vitro with low nanomolar IC₅₀ values. However, achieving the necessary selectivity to avoid interference with other kinases remains a significant challenge (nayyab2025identificationoftssk1 pages 19-21, shang2014testisspecificproteinkinases pages 125-126).

Clinically, mutations or deletions that compromise TSSK2 expression or function have been linked to various forms of male infertility, including asthenoteratozoospermia, oligospermia, and azoospermia. Such associations underscore the critical role of TSSK2 in sperm development and validate its significance as a biomarker for male reproductive health (kadiyska2022roleoftestis‑specific pages 7-8, nayyab2025identificationoftssk1 pages 1-2). Furthermore, ongoing research is expected to further elucidate the downstream signaling pathways orchestrated by TSSK2, potentially revealing additional targets for therapeutic intervention. The combination of genetic studies, biochemical analyses, and inhibitor development is paving the way for the design of next-generation compounds that could serve as effective non-hormonal contraceptives, thereby addressing a critical need in reproductive medicine (salicioni2020testisspecificserinekinase pages 24-25, shang2010functionaltransformationof pages 1-2).

In summary, TSSK2 presents an attractive profile owing to its exclusive expression in the testis, its highly conserved kinase domain, and its essential role in the morphological and functional maturation of spermatozoa. Future studies focusing on the structural elucidation and regulatory networks surrounding TSSK2 are necessary to fully harness its potential in both clinical diagnostics and as a target for male contraceptive development (nayyab2025identificationoftssk1 pages 7-9, salicioni2020testisspecificserinekinase pages 25-25).
