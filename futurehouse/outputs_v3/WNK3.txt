1. Phylogeny  
WNK3, also known as Protein kinase lysine‐deficient 3 or Protein kinase with no lysine 3, is a member of the atypical WNK (With No Lysine [K]) serine/threonine kinase family that diverges from classical kinases by its unique catalytic domain organization (jordan2011wnk2(wnklysine pages 1-3). Members of the WNK kinase family—comprising WNK1, WNK2, WNK3, and WNK4—share an evolutionary origin that can be traced back to early eukaryotic lineages, with the conservation of key catalytic and regulatory domains being evident in species from invertebrates to mammals (yarikipati2023unanticipateddomainrequirements pages 1-2). Comparative sequence analyses indicate that WNK3, in particular, exhibits high sequence similarity with its paralogs; for example, the catalytic domain of WNK2 shows approximately 91% identity with that of WNK3, underscoring their close evolutionary relationship (jordan2011wnk2(wnklysine pages 1-3). Phylogenetic studies place the WNK kinases as part of an ancient clade within the human kinome that is dedicated to the regulation of ion homeostasis and osmotic balance, and WNK3 is consistently found within this lineage alongside its orthologs in various vertebrate species (jung2022wnk1inmalignant pages 8-9). Although all WNK family members share a core catalytic architecture, sequence variations in accessory domains and regulatory regions contribute to the tissue-specific expression and functional diversification observed for WNK3 relative to other family kinases (kankanamalage2018wnkpathwaysin pages 1-3). Collectively, these evolutionary relationships define WNK3 as an integral component of a conserved regulatory network controlling ion transport and cell volume across metazoans (yarikipati2023unanticipateddomainrequirements pages 12-14).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
WNK3 catalyzes the phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues on target substrate proteins, thereby transferring a phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl groups of these amino acids (heros2014thewnkregulatedspakosr1 pages 14-15). The chemical transformation effected by WNK3 conforms to the general reaction characteristic of serine/threonine kinases: ATP + [protein]-(L‑serine or L‑threonine) yields ADP + [protein]-(L‑serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (heros2014thewnkregulatedspakosr1 pages 14-15). This reaction is fundamental for modulating the functional states of proteins, particularly in signaling cascades that regulate electrolyte balance and cellular adaptation to osmotic stress (heros2014thewnkregulatedspakosr1 pages 15-15).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The enzymatic activity of WNK3 requires ATP as a phosphate donor, which is coordinated by divalent metal ions, most notably magnesium (Mg²⁺), to stabilize the nucleotide within the active site (kim2024inhibitionofwnk pages 16-17). Magnesium ions, by complexing with ATP, facilitate the proper orientation of the phosphate groups for the phosphoryl transfer reaction, a requirement that is consistent with the cofactor dependencies observed in other serine/threonine kinases belonging to the WNK family (kankanamalage2018wnkpathwaysin pages 1-3). This cofactor dependency ensures that the catalytic mechanism of WNK3 proceeds efficiently under physiological conditions.

4. Substrate Specificity  
WNK3 exerts its regulatory function primarily through the phosphorylation of downstream kinases such as SPAK (also known as STK39) and OXSR1 (OSR1), which are crucial mediators of ion transport regulation (heros2014thewnkregulatedspakosr1 pages 14-15). The substrate specificity of WNK3 is determined in part by the recognition of specific sequence motifs present on its target proteins, with its activity directed toward serine/threonine residues located in conserved regions within SPAK and OSR1 (heros2014thewnkregulatedspakosr1 pages 15-15). Furthermore, the phosphorylation of these kinases results in their activation and subsequent phosphorylation of cation–chloride cotransporters including NKCC1, NKCC2, NCC, and various KCC isoforms; thus, WNK3 indirectly regulates integral components of ion homeostasis by controlling the activity state of these transporters (kankanamalage2018wnkpathwaysin pages 5-5). This cascade ensures that downstream responses such as regulatory volume increase and electrolyte balance can be swiftly modulated in response to changes in the cellular environment.

5. Structure  
WNK3 is characterized by a central catalytic kinase domain that is atypical due to the repositioning of the catalytic lysine residue away from the canonical subdomain II; instead, this lysine is found within the glycine-rich loop, which is a hallmark of the WNK kinase family (yarikipati2023unanticipateddomainrequirements pages 22-23). Structural investigations, including crystallographic studies of related WNK isoforms and predictive modeling via AlphaFold, indicate that the kinase domain of WNK3 adopts the classical bilobal architecture seen in serine/threonine kinases, with a smaller N-terminal lobe responsible for ATP binding and a larger C-terminal lobe that serves as the substrate binding region (yoon2022wnk3inhibitionelicits pages 8-9). In addition to the catalytic domain, WNK3 contains an auto-inhibitory domain that modulates its kinase activity by imposing a conformational restraint in the absence of activating stimuli (yoon2022wnk3inhibitionelicits pages 7-8). Coiled-coil motifs within the C-terminal region facilitate protein–protein interactions necessary for the assembly of multiprotein complexes within the WNK signaling cascade (yoon2022wnk3inhibitionelicits pages 7-8). Notably, recent structural data suggest that WNK3 may also participate in liquid–liquid phase separation, enabling the formation of membraneless compartments under hyperosmotic conditions; these compartments concentrate WNK3 along with its substrates, thereby enhancing the efficiency of substrate phosphorylation under stress (kim2024inhibitionofwnk pages 17-18). The unique structural features of WNK3, including its non-canonical catalytic residue positioning and modular regulatory domains, underpin its specialized functions in cellular osmoregulation and ion homeostasis (yarikipati2023unanticipateddomainrequirements pages 19-21).

6. Regulation  
The activity of WNK3 is modulated by several regulatory mechanisms that ensure its responsiveness to changes in the cellular environment. Under hyperosmotic stress, WNK3 undergoes autophosphorylation within its activation loop, a modification that is essential for shifting the kinase into an active conformation (heros2014thewnkregulatedspakosr1 pages 15-15). This autophosphorylation event is typically triggered by the reduced intracellular chloride concentration that accompanies cell shrinkage and osmotic imbalance (kankanamalage2018wnkpathwaysin pages 3-4). In addition to autophosphorylation, upstream signaling pathways such as EGF-mediated PI3K-AKT activation contribute to the regulation of WNK3 by phosphorylating regulatory regions or modulating the activity of interacting proteins (kim2024inhibitionofwnk pages 16-17). WNK3 is also subject to modulation through protein–protein interactions; for example, regulatory proteins including pseudokinases like NRBP1 can bind to components of the WNK pathway and enhance kinase activity through allosteric mechanisms, thereby contributing to the fine‐tuning of the stress response (yarikipati2023unanticipateddomainrequirements pages 21-22). Furthermore, chemical inhibition studies employing inhibitors such as WNK463 have provided insights into the dynamic regulation of WNK3, demonstrating that pharmacological intervention can suppress its kinase activity and downstream signaling outputs (yoon2022wnk3inhibitionelicits pages 6-6). These layers of regulation—ranging from intrinsic autophosphorylation to extrinsic modifications by upstream kinases and regulatory protein interactions—ensure that WNK3 activity is tightly controlled in the context of electrolyte homeostasis and cellular volume regulation (sharma2023insightsintothe pages 3-4).

7. Function  
WNK3 is a pivotal component of the WNK3-SPAK/OSR1 signaling cascade, which plays an essential role in the maintenance of electrolyte homeostasis and in mediating the regulatory volume increase response under hyperosmotic stress (heros2014thewnkregulatedspakosr1 pages 14-15). By phosphorylating and activating downstream kinases such as SPAK and OSR1, WNK3 indirectly governs the phosphorylation status and activity of key ion cotransporters, including those belonging to the NKCC and KCC families, thereby influencing cellular sodium, potassium, and chloride transport (heros2014thewnkregulatedspakosr1 pages 15-15). This cascade is essential for ensuring that cells can recover their volume after shrinkage induced by osmotic stress, a process that is critical for preserving cell integrity and function (kankanamalage2018wnkpathwaysin pages 4-5). In addition, recent studies have implicated WNK3 in the context of tumor biology; experimental data from non-small cell lung carcinoma models indicate that WNK3 regulates PD-L1 expression on tumor cells, with its inhibition leading to a reduction in PD-L1 levels and an enhancement of cytotoxic T-cell activity (yoon2022wnk3inhibitionelicits pages 7-8). This finding suggests that WNK3 not only modulates ion homeostasis but also plays an influential role in cancer immunology by affecting immune checkpoint regulation (yoon2022wnk3inhibitionelicits pages 8-9). Moreover, the tissue-specific expression of WNK3, which is observed predominantly in the brain, liver, and select epithelial tissues, underscores its importance in diverse physiological contexts, including neuronal signaling and renal function (kankanamalage2018wnkpathwaysin pages 1-3). Through its central position in the phosphorylation cascade, WNK3 facilitates coordinated responses to osmotic challenges, making it indispensable for both normal cellular physiology and pathophysiological conditions related to ion transport dysregulation (jung2022wnk1inmalignant pages 10-10).

8. Other Comments  
Selective inhibition of WNK3 with small-molecule inhibitors, such as WNK463, has emerged as an experimental strategy to attenuate its kinase activity and thereby modulate downstream signaling events (kim2024inhibitionofwnk pages 17-18). In preclinical settings, inhibition of WNK3 has been associated with a reduction in membrane PD-L1 levels, which correlates with enhanced T-cell effector function and improved antitumor immune responses, positioning WNK3 as a potential target in cancer immunotherapy (yoon2022wnk3inhibitionelicits pages 5-6). In addition, aberrations in the activity of the WNK3-SPAK/OSR1 cascade are linked to clinical conditions characterized by electrolyte imbalance and hypertension, mirroring the phenotypes observed in disorders related to other WNK family members (heros2014thewnkregulatedspakosr1 pages 14-15). One of the most noteworthy and unique aspects of WNK3 is its reported ability to undergo liquid–liquid phase separation under conditions of hyperosmotic stress, leading to the formation of membraneless compartments that concentrate the kinase together with its substrates—this property may augment the efficiency of downstream phosphorylation events (kim2024inhibitionofwnk pages 17-18). Furthermore, while the direct impact of specific WNK3 mutations on disease phenotypes has yet to be fully elucidated, the central role of WNK3 in regulating ion transport and cell volume suggests that dysregulation of its kinase activity could contribute to pathophysiological states such as salt-sensitive hypertension and possibly influence tumor microenvironment dynamics (sharma2023insightsintothe pages 14-14). Consequently, the unique enzymatic and regulatory properties of WNK3 underscore its potential as a therapeutic target for conditions ranging from electrolyte disorders to certain cancers, with ongoing research aimed at developing more selective inhibitors that exploit its atypical catalytic mechanism (yarikipati2023unanticipateddomainrequirements pages 22-23).
