1. Phylogeny  
Tyrosine‐protein kinase ZAP-70 (gene symbol ZAP70, also known as SRK) is a member of the Syk family of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases that is evolutionarily conserved among vertebrates. Its domain organization and sequence conservation, particularly within its two N-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domains and its C-terminal kinase domain, parallel those seen in Syk kinase, underscoring their derivation from a common ancestral gene duplication event. ZAP-70 is predominantly expressed in T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, and although low levels are transiently detected in early B cell precursors, its expression is mainly restricted to the cells responsible for adaptive immunity. This conservation of domain architecture and tissue specificity reflects an ancient evolutionary requirement for a dedicated kinase in T cell receptor (TCR) signaling (yan2013structuralbasisfor pages 1-2, mocsai2010thesyktyrosine pages 1-2, bolen1997leukocyteproteintyrosine pages 9-11).

2. Reaction Catalyzed  
ZAP-70 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to specific tyrosine residues on target protein substrates. The overall chemical reaction can be summarized as follows:  
  ATP + [protein]-tyrosine → ADP + [protein]-phosphotyrosine + H⁺.  
This phosphotransfer reaction is central to its role in signal transduction downstream of the activated TCR, allowing for the phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) as well as downstream adaptors (deindl2007structuralbasisfor pages 12-12).

3. Cofactor Requirements  
The catalytic activity of ZAP-70 depends on its ability to bind ATP, and like most protein kinases, it requires a divalent cation—most commonly Mg²⁺—as a cofactor. The presence of Mg²⁺ is essential for the correct positioning of ATP within the active site and for the subsequent transfer of the phosphate group to the substrate tyrosine residues (deindl2007structuralbasisfor pages 1-3, torchia2018intensityandduration pages 2-3).

4. Substrate Specificity  
ZAP-70 is known to preferentially phosphorylate tyrosine residues within specific sequence contexts. Its tandem SH2 domains bind with high affinity to doubly phosphorylated ITAM motifs, which generally conform to a consensus sequence of YXX(L/I)X₆₋₈YXX(L/I). In doing so, ZAP-70 is recruited to the TCR complex where it catalyzes phosphorylation events on the receptor itself as well as on downstream adaptor proteins—most notably LAT (linker for activation of T cells) and SLP-76 (LCP2)—which contain critical tyrosine residues that propagate the TCR signal. In addition, peptide library screening approaches have identified that substrates for ZAP-70 display a preference for hydrophobic residues flanking the target tyrosine, contributing to its high degree of substrate specificity (deindl2007structuralbasisfor pages 1-3, nishikawa2000apeptidelibrary pages 1-2, dine2021positivefeedbackbetween pages 14-16).

5. Structure  
ZAP-70 is a 70 kDa protein that exhibits a modular organization characteristic of many signaling kinases. Its overall structure can be divided into three major regions:
 • The N-terminal region contains two tandem SH2 domains that are linked by a short interdomain (often referred to as interdomain A). These SH2 domains are responsible for binding to phosphorylated ITAMs on the TCR ζ-chain, a critical step in the recruitment of ZAP-70 to the activated TCR.
 • Following the SH2 domains is the interdomain B, commonly described as the SH2-kinase linker. This region plays an important autoregulatory role by forming intramolecular contacts with the kinase domain.
 • The C-terminal region harbors the kinase domain, which consists of the typical bilobal architecture with an N-terminal lobe largely responsible for ATP binding and a C-terminal lobe that provides the substrate binding surface and catalytic machinery. Within the kinase domain, the activation loop contains critical tyrosine residues (Tyr492 and Tyr493) whose phosphorylation is required for full catalytic activity.
Crystal structures of ZAP-70 in its autoinhibited form have revealed that the SH2-kinase linker interacts closely with the kinase domain to form what is sometimes described as a “linker-kinase sandwich,” a configuration that restricts flexibility and catalytic activity. Displacement of the linker from the kinase domain occurs upon binding to doubly phosphorylated ITAMs and is further stabilized by subsequent phosphorylation events on Tyr315 and Tyr319 within the linker, thereby relieving auto‐inhibition and allowing the kinase to adopt an open, active conformation. The kinase domain itself contains conserved motifs typical of tyrosine kinases, including the DFG motif at the start of the activation loop and the αC helix in the N-lobe. These elements form part of the hydrophobic spine that is essential for catalytic function and are common targets for kinase inhibitors in drug design (bunuel2024targetingzap70protein pages 74-79, deindl2007structuralbasisfor pages 9-10, yan2013structuralbasisfor pages 7-8, huber2015thestructuralbasis pages 2-4).

6. Regulation  
The activity of ZAP-70 is tightly regulated through multiple post-translational mechanisms and conformational changes that ensure precise control of TCR signaling:
 • Autoinhibition is maintained in the resting state by intramolecular interactions involving the SH2-kinase linker and the kinase domain. This “linker-kinase sandwich” holds the enzyme in a closed conformation that restricts substrate access.
 • Upon TCR engagement, phosphorylated ITAMs provide docking sites for ZAP-70 via its SH2 domains, which promotes a conformational rearrangement in the linker region. This rearrangement is a prerequisite for subsequent phosphorylation events.
 • Src family kinases, particularly Lck, catalyze the phosphorylation of key tyrosine residues within ZAP-70. Phosphorylation of Tyr315 and Tyr319 in the SH2-kinase linker is critical for relieving auto-inhibition, while phosphorylation of Tyr492 and Tyr493 in the kinase domain activation loop dramatically increases catalytic activity.
 • Negative regulation is achieved via ubiquitination; for instance, modification at Lys217 has been shown to attenuate ZAP-70 signaling without directing the protein for proteasomal degradation. This modification serves as a feedback mechanism to prevent overactivation of T cells.
 • Additional regulatory control is provided by phosphatases, which can dephosphorylate ZAP-70, thereby modulating the intensity and duration of downstream signaling events (deindl2007structuralbasisfor pages 11-12, yan2013structuralbasisfor pages 7-8, carpino2016negativeregulationof pages 1-2, torchia2018intensityandduration pages 3-4, dine2021positivefeedbackbetween pages 14-16).

7. Function  
ZAP-70 is a central signaling molecule within the adaptive immune system. Its primary functions include:
 • Mediation of TCR Signal Transduction: Upon antigen recognition, the TCR's ITAMs become phosphorylated by Src family kinases such as Lck. The phosphorylated ITAMs recruit ZAP-70 via its tandem SH2 domains, which in turn becomes activated following phosphorylation. Active ZAP-70 phosphorylates key adaptor proteins—most notably LAT and SLP-76—thereby initiating a cascade of downstream signaling events that result in T cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation. This cascade ultimately leads to the production of cytokines and lymphokines necessary for an effective immune response (dine2021positivefeedbackbetween pages 14-16, mel2022tandnk pages 15-16, torchia2018intensityandduration pages 2-3, yan2013structuralbasisfor pages 1-2).
 • Thymocyte Development: During T cell development in the thymus, ZAP-70 plays a crucial role in both positive and negative selection processes, ensuring that only T cells with appropriate antigen specificity mature and migrate to the periphery.
 • Regulation of Cytoskeletal Dynamics and Adhesion: Beyond its role in signal transduction, ZAP-70 also influences cytoskeletal rearrangements and adhesion processes, which are essential for proper T cell motility and the formation of the immunological synapse.
 • Contribution to B Lymphocyte Function: Although expressed at low levels in early B cell development, ZAP-70 has been implicated in modulating B cell receptor (BCR) signaling in certain contexts, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), where its aberrant expression correlates with aggressive disease phenotypes (mel2022tandnk pages 16-17, torchia2018intensityandduration pages 2-3).
Thus, ZAP-70 functions as a critical hub that translates extracellular antigen recognition into a coordinated intracellular response, ensuring the proper activation and development of lymphocytes (dine2021positivefeedbackbetween pages 14-16, mel2022tandnk pages 15-16).

8. Other Comments  
Multiple studies have focused on developing inhibitors targeting ZAP-70 due to its central role in TCR signaling. Peptide library approaches have been employed to identify inhibitors that can competitively block its kinase activity with high specificity, offering potential tools for dissecting T cell signaling and for therapeutic modulation in autoimmune conditions or lymphoid malignancies (nishikawa2000apeptidelibrary pages 1-2). In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), overexpression of ZAP-70 is correlated with an aggressive disease course, highlighting its prognostic value and raising the possibility of targeting its adaptor functions in such malignancies (fernandezaguilar2023astoryof pages 5-7, mel2022tandnk pages 2-4). Furthermore, the interplay of phosphorylation and ubiquitination—particularly the negative regulatory ubiquitination of Lys217—provides additional layers of regulatory control that may serve as alternative targets for pharmacological intervention (carpino2016negativeregulationof pages 1-2). No clinically approved specific inhibitors of ZAP-70 exist to date; however, its pivotal role in T cell activation makes it an attractive target for the design of novel immunomodulatory agents. The cumulative data from structural, biochemical, and cellular studies reinforce the importance of precise regulation of ZAP-70 activity in maintaining immune homeostasis and suggest that dysregulation may contribute to a variety of immune-related disorders (gangopadhyay2020anallosterichot pages 1-4, gangopadhyay2022regulatingthediscriminatory pages 5-6).
