## Phylogeny  
• MAP3K7/TAK1 is classified within the MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) family of the Tyrosine-Like Kinase (TKL) group of the human kinome (unknownauthors2017targetingtransforminggrowth pages 28-34).  
• One-to-one orthologs are documented in Mus musculus (Map3k7), Drosophila melanogaster (Tak1) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae members of the STE kinase group, demonstrating conservation from yeast to mammals (kilty2015tak1selectiveinhibition pages 7-8, totzke2020tak1apotent pages 4-5).  
• Sequence/structure clustering positions TAK1 closest to IRAK1, IRAK4 and TNNI3K, kinases that share the distinctive DFG-1 cysteine in the ATP pocket (unknownauthors2017targetingtransforminggrowth pages 64-76).  

## Reaction Catalyzed  
ATP + [protein]-Ser/Thr → ADP + [protein]-Ser/Thr-P (unknownauthors2017targetingtransforminggrowth pages 76-87).  

## Cofactor Requirements  
Catalysis requires divalent cations; Mg²⁺ or Mn²⁺ support optimal turnover in purified kinase assays (unknownauthors2017targetingtransforminggrowth pages 45-50).  

## Substrate Specificity  
• Phosphoproteomic profiling and peptide-based assays define a preference for basic residues at positions −3/−2 and a hydrophobic residue at +1 surrounding the phospho-acceptor Ser/Thr (fechtner2017transforminggrowthfactor pages 9-9).  
• The optimized assay peptide RLGRDKYKTLRQIRQ embodies this consensus and is efficiently phosphorylated by TAK1 (unknownauthors2017targetingtransforminggrowth pages 56-64).  
• Johnson et al. 2023 is cited in these studies as the global source of the TAK1 consensus motif (kilty2015tak1selectiveinhibition pages 8-10).  

## Structure  
• The catalytic domain spans residues 35–303 and adopts the canonical bilobal kinase fold with an N-lobe (residues 1-104), hinge (Met104-Ser111) and C-lobe (111-303) (unknownauthors2017targetingtransforminggrowth pages 28-34).  
• Key catalytic elements: Lys63 (β3) couples with Glu77 (αC) for salt-bridge formation; the Asp175-Phe176-Gly177 (DFG) motif coordinates Mg²⁺; Cys174 at DFG-1 is a reactive nucleophile targeted by covalent inhibitors (tan2017structureguideddevelopmentof pages 17-21).  
• Crystal structures capture active DFG-in (TAK1–TAB1–Takinib, PDB 5V5N) and inactive DFG-out (TAK1–ABC-FP, PDB 4L53) conformations, illustrating activation-loop mobility and hydrophobic spine alignment (unknownauthors2017targetingtransforminggrowth pages 39-45).  
• A TAB1-binding helix centred on Phe484 within the C-terminal regulatory tail stabilises the active kinase (unknownauthors2017targetingtransforminggrowth pages 28-34).  

## Regulation  
Post-translational modifications  
– Autophosphorylation on Thr178, Thr184, Thr187 and Ser192 is essential for full catalytic activity (unknownauthors2017targetingtransforminggrowth pages 87-91).  
– PKA/PRKX-mediated phosphorylation of Ser412 provides an additional positive regulatory site (unknownauthors2018novelsignalingmechanisms pages 27-31).  
– K63-linked polyubiquitination at Lys158 (and Lys209) or monoubiquitination at Lys34 promotes activation, whereas K48-linked chains at Lys72 target the kinase for degradation (fechtner2017transforminggrowthfactor pages 1-2).  
Enzymes  
– TRAF6 (IL-1/TLR) and TRAF2/5 (TNF) catalyse activating ubiquitination; the deubiquitinase CYLD removes K63 chains to terminate signalling (hirata2017posttranslationalmodificationsof pages 10-12).  
– ITCH adds inhibitory ubiquitin chains that attenuate output (roh2014tak1regulateshepatic pages 7-8).  
Complex assembly and conformational control  
– Constitutive TAB1 binding and TAB2/3 recruitment via K63-Ub chains position TAK1 molecules for intermolecular autophosphorylation (conner2006tak1bindingprotein1 pages 1-2).  
– Switching between DFG-out and DFG-in states serves as an intrinsic conformational gate and dictates inhibitor binding mode (unknownauthors2017targetingtransforminggrowth pages 39-45).  

## Function  
Expression  
– TAK1 is broadly expressed with pronounced levels in immune cells, hepatocytes, keratinocytes and fibroblasts (roh2014tak1regulateshepatic pages 7-8).  
Upstream signalling  
– Activated downstream of TNF-R via RIP1–TRAF2/5, IL-1R/TLR4 via MyD88–IRAK1/4–TRAF6, and TGF-β/BMP receptors via TRAF6 (fechtner2017transforminggrowthfactor pages 1-2).  
Downstream targets  
– Direct substrates include MAP2K4/7 leading to JNK activation, MAP2K3/6 leading to p38 activation, and the IKK complex leading to NF-κB activation (kilty2015tak1selectiveinhibition pages 10-10).  
Physiological roles  
– Coordinates pro-inflammatory cytokine production, maintains epithelial integrity, supports skeletal morphogenesis and preserves hepatocyte survival (roh2014tak1regulateshepatic pages 7-8, unknownauthors2017targetingtransforminggrowth pages 197-201).  

## Inhibitors  
• 5Z-7-Oxozeaenol – irreversible covalent inhibitor targeting Cys174; IC₅₀ ≈ 9 nM (kilty2015tak1selectiveinhibition pages 7-8).  
• Takinib – type 1.5 ATP-competitive inhibitor; IC₅₀ 8–10 nM; co-crystal structure PDB 5V5N (unknownauthors2017targetingtransforminggrowth pages 56-64).  
• NG-25 – type II inhibitor that stabilises the DFG-out state; IC₅₀ ≈ 4 nM (unknownauthors2017targetingtransforminggrowth pages 39-45).  
• LYTAK1 – reversible ATP-competitive inhibitor with anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activity (roh2014tak1regulateshepatic pages 7-8).  
• 2,4-Disubstituted pyrimidines (e.g., compound 5) – covalent inhibitors exploiting the DFG-1 cysteine, single-digit nM potency (tan2017structureguideddevelopmentof pages 17-21).  

## Other Comments  
• Germline MAP3K7 mutations that enhance autophosphorylation cause frontometaphyseal dysplasia; kinase-domain missense variants produce milder skeletal phenotypes (wade2016mutationsinmap3k7 pages 2-3).  
• Heterozygous loss- or gain-of-function variants also underlie cardiospondylocarpofacial syndrome, indicating the developmental importance of tightly regulated TAK1 activity (goff2016heterozygousmutationsin pages 7-7).  
• Persistent TAK1 activation is implicated in rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, Sjögren’s syndrome, gout and multiple cancers (fechtner2017transforminggrowthfactor pages 1-2, unknownauthors2017targetingtransforminggrowth pages 197-201).
