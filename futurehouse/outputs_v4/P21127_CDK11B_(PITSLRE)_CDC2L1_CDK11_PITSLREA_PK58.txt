## Phylogeny  
Cyclin-dependent kinase 11B (CDK11B; UniProt P21127) is assigned to the CMGC group, CDK family of the human kinome (manning2002theproteinkinase pages 2-3). A recent segmental duplication on chromosome 1 generated the very close paralog CDK11A; the two proteins differ by only 16 amino acids (malumbres2009cyclindependentkinasesa pages 2-4). Sequence-based clustering places CDK11B nearest to CDK11A, CDK8 and CDK9 within the CDK subfamily (varjosalo2013theproteininteraction pages 4-5). Single-copy orthologs are conserved in Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Xenopus laevis, Danio rerio, Drosophila melanogaster and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, reflecting broad evolutionary conservation of PITSLRE kinases (malumbres2009cyclindependentkinasesa pages 2-4).  

## Reaction Catalyzed  
ATP + protein-L-Ser/Thr ⇌ ADP + protein-L-Ser/Thr-phosphate (loyer2005roleofcdkcyclin pages 4-5).  

## Cofactor Requirements  
Catalysis requires a divalent cation, preferentially Mg²⁺, to coordinate the ATP phosphates within the active site (scheeff2005structuralevolutionof pages 12-13).  

## Substrate Specificity  
In vitro and cellular mapping indicate a preference for Ser/Thr-Pro motifs with a basic residue at +3; consensus: S/T-P-X-K/R (unknownauthors2020investigatingtherole pages 13-18).  

## Structure  
CDK11B is a 912-residue protein organised as follows:  
• N-terminal regulatory segment (≈1-400) containing multiple nuclear localisation signals and a canonical 14-3-3 docking site (unknownauthors2006theregulationand pages 35-39).  
• Central arginine/glutamic acid-rich (RE) domain (≈400-560) that recruits spliceosomal factors (unknownauthors2006theregulationand pages 35-39).  
• Poly-glutamic acid (poly-E) domain (≈560-650) harbouring an internal ribosome entry site essential for translation of the mitotic p58 isoform (zhou2016theemergingroles pages 3-5).  
• C-terminal kinase domain (≈700-912) displaying the canonical bilobal CDK fold with PSTAIRE helix, Lys-Glu ion pair, C-helix, DFG motif and activation-loop Thr required for catalysis; these elements are evident in the AlphaFold model AF-P21127-F1 (loyer2020rolesofcdkcyclin pages 9-10, scheeff2005structuralevolutionof pages 10-11).  
Unique features include multiple caspase cleavage sites within the regulatory segment that generate catalytically active p46 and p60 fragments during apoptosis (unknownauthors2006theregulationand pages 35-39). No experimentally solved PDB structure is currently available (loyer2020rolesofcdkcyclin pages 9-10).  

## Regulation  
Post-translational modifications  
– CK2 phosphorylates N-terminal Ser residues, enhancing transcription/splicing functions (unknownauthors2006theregulationand pages 35-39).  
– CHK2 phosphorylates CDK11p110, promoting homodimerisation and global splicing activity (unknownauthors2020investigatingtherole pages 25-28).  
– Autophosphorylation of the activation-loop Thr is necessary for full catalytic activity (loyer2020rolesofcdkcyclin pages 5-6).  
Proteolytic control  
– Caspase-1 and caspase-3 cleave p110 and p58 at defined Asp sites to release p46 and p60, shifting substrate specificity toward apoptotic targets (unknownauthors2006theregulationand pages 43-48).  
Translation control  
– An IRES embedded in the poly-E domain restricts p58 synthesis to G2/M and is modulated by eIF2α phosphorylation and Unr binding (unknownauthors2006theregulationand pages 35-39).  
Protein interactions  
– Kinase activation requires binding to Cyclin L1 or Cyclin L2; the mitotic p58 isoform can additionally engage Cyclin D3 (zhou2016theemergingroles pages 3-5).  
– 14-3-3γ and the chaperones Hsp70/Hsp90 associate with distinct isoforms to control localisation and stability (unknownauthors2006theregulationand pages 145-149).  

## Function  
Expression and isoforms  
– p110 is constitutively nuclear throughout the cell cycle; p58 is expressed exclusively at G2/M; p46 and p60 appear following caspase cleavage during apoptosis (unknownauthors2006theregulationand pages 53-57).  
Transcription and splicing  
– p110 phosphorylates the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain and SR splicing factors RNPS1 and 9G8, cooperating with elongation factor ELL2 to couple transcription with 3'-end processing (unknownauthors2006theregulationand pages 39-43).  
Mitosis  
– p58 regulates centrosome maturation, bipolar spindle assembly and sister-chromatid cohesion by recruiting PLK1, PLK4 and Cep192 (unknownauthors2020investigatingtherole pages 25-28).  
Apoptosis and translation control  
– p46 phosphorylates PAK1, NOT2, RanBPM and eIF3f, inhibiting translation and promoting anoikis; p60 relocates to mitochondria to trigger cytochrome c release (unknownauthors2006theregulationand pages 43-48).  
Cytoskeleton  
– Interaction with vimentin, α/β-tubulin and lamin A implicates CDK11B in microtubule dynamics (unknownauthors2006theregulationand pages 145-149).  

## Inhibitors  
OTS964 is a potent, selective small-molecule inhibitor of CDK11 (biochemical IC₅₀ ≈ 10–100 nM) that blocks spliceosome activation; resistance-conferring CDK11 mutations emerge upon chronic exposure (hluchy2022cdk11regulatespremrna pages 1-6, loyer2020rolesofcdkcyclin pages 7-8). No approved clinical inhibitors have been reported.  

## Other Comments  
High CDK11B expression is essential for survival of breast cancer, multiple myeloma, osteosarcoma and melanoma cells and correlates with poor prognosis (loyer2020rolesofcdkcyclin pages 7-8). The CDC2L1 gene resides within the 1p36.3 region, a hotspot for chromosomal alterations in cancer (zhou2016theemergingroles pages 1-3).
