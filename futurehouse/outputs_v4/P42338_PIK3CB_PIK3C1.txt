Phylogeny
PIK3CB is a Class IA phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) catalytic subunit (dbouk2013characterizationofa pages 7-7, ilic2010comparingtheroles pages 5-7). Based on Manning et al. 2002, PI3Ks are categorized separately from conventional eukaryotic protein kinase groups, sometimes considered 'Atypical' kinases (nakanishi2016activatingmutationsin pages 5-5, nakanishi2016activatingmutationsin pages 9-9). Another classification places Class I PI3Ks in the lipid kinase family within the Protein Kinase-like (PKL) group (burke2018structuralbasisfor pages 5-6). PIK3CB clusters phylogenetically with other PI3K isoforms like PIK3CA and PIK3CG (brown2011phylogenomicsofphosphoinositide pages 3-4). Well-conserved PIK3CB orthologs are found across vertebrates, including in human (*Homo sapiens*), mouse (*Mus musculus*), rat (*Rattus norvegicus*), zebrafish (*Danio rerio*), and pufferfish (*Tetraodon nigroviridis*) (brown2011phylogenomicsofphosphoinositide pages 3-4). Orthologs are also present in Deuterostomia (*Strongylocentrotus purpuratus*), Tunicata (*Ciona intestinalis*), and Cephalochordata (*Branchiostoma floridae*), indicating broad conservation across chordates (brown2011phylogenomicsofphosphoinositide pages 8-9).


Reaction Catalyzed
PIK3CB is a lipid kinase that catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of the 3'-hydroxyl group of the inositol ring of phosphoinositides (flanagan2014structurefunctionand pages 5-5, whale2017functionalcharacterizationof pages 1-2). The primary enzymatic reaction is the conversion of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) using ATP as a phosphate donor (burke2018structuralbasisfor pages 2-4, dbouk2013characterizationofa pages 7-7, gavgani2018classiphosphoinositide pages 1-3).


Cofactor Requirements
The kinase activity of PIK3CB requires ATP and a divalent metal ion cofactor (ilic2010comparingtheroles pages 5-7, miller2019structuraldeterminantsof pages 3-5). Both Mg2+ and Mn2+ can serve as cofactors for the catalytic reaction (flanagan2014structurefunctionand pages 5-5, ilic2010comparingtheroles pages 5-7). p110β functions with Mg2+, in contrast to the p110δ isoform which is Mn2+ dependent (buchanan2013oncogenicmutationsof pages 7-7).


Substrate Specificity
PIK3CB primarily functions as a lipid kinase with substrate specificity for phosphoinositides, preferentially phosphorylating phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) (dbouk2013novelapproachesto pages 1-2, whale2017functionalcharacterizationof pages 1-2). It can also phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) (miller2019structuraldeterminantsof pages 25-26). There are conflicting reports regarding its protein kinase activity. Some studies report that p110β possesses additional protein-serine kinase activity and can autophosphorylate and phosphorylate exogenous protein substrates such as p85 and IRS-1 (backer2011theregulationof pages 12-14, buchanan2013oncogenicmutationsof pages 7-7, buchanan2013oncogenicmutationsof pages 7-8). In contrast, comprehensive substrate profiling by Johnson et al. 2023 indicates that PIK3CB exhibits no significant intrinsic protein kinase activity (brown2011phylogenomicsofphosphoinositide pages 3-4, burke2018structuralbasisfor pages 5-6, nakanishi2016activatingmutationsin pages 7-7).


Structure
The p110β catalytic subunit contains five domains: an N-terminal adaptor-binding domain (ABD), a Ras-binding domain (RBD), a C2 domain, a helical domain, and a C-terminal bilobed kinase domain (backer2011theregulationof pages 1-4, rathinaswamy2020classiphosphoinositide pages 1-2). The ABD binds the inter-SH2 (iSH2) domain of the p85 regulatory subunit to stabilize the complex (backer2011theregulationof pages 1-4, gavgani2018classiphosphoinositide pages 3-5). The C2 domain of p110β contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS) absent in p110α (gavgani2018classiphosphoinositide pages 3-5). The kinase domain adopts a two-lobed structure with the ATP binding site at the hinge region between the lobes (miller2019structuraldeterminantsof pages 3-5). The crystal structure of murine p110β in complex with the inhibitor GDC-0941 and the iSH2 and cSH2 domains of p85β has been resolved (PDB: 2Y3A) (miller2019structuraldeterminantsof pages 3-5, dornan2017conformationaldisruptionof pages 2-3). The AlphaFold model for human PIK3CB is also available (miller2019structuraldeterminantsof pages 3-5). A key regulatory feature is the C-terminal helix (Kα12), which folds over the catalytic loop, locking it in an inactive conformation through an inhibitory interaction with the cSH2 domain of p85 (zhang2011structureoflipid pages 5-6). Unlike p110α, p110β stabilization depends primarily on the cSH2 domain of p85 (miller2019structuraldeterminantsof pages 3-5).


Regulation
The activity of p110β is tightly controlled by its interaction with a p85 regulatory subunit, which stabilizes the catalytic subunit and inhibits its basal activity (backer2011theregulationof pages 12-14, burke2018structuralbasisfor pages 2-4). Inhibition is mediated by contacts from the p85 nSH2 domain to the p110β helical, C2, and kinase domains, as well as a distinct contact between the p85 cSH2 domain and the p110β kinase domain C-terminus (rathinaswamy2020classiphosphoinositide pages 2-5, zhang2011structureoflipid pages 1-2). Activation downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) occurs when the p85 SH2 domains bind to pYXXM phosphotyrosine motifs, relieving inhibition (rathinaswamy2020classiphosphoinositide pages 2-5). Uniquely, p110β is also activated directly by Gβγ subunits from G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and by Rho family GTPases, such as RAC (backer2011theregulationof pages 12-14, burke2018structuralbasisfor pages 5-6, gavgani2018classiphosphoinositide pages 3-5). Post-translational modifications include inhibitory autophosphorylation at Ser1070 in the C-terminal region (backer2011theregulationof pages 12-14). Phosphorylation of the p85 subunit also modulates activity; for example, phosphorylation of p85α at Ser608 by p110 catalytic subunits acts as negative feedback, whereas phosphorylation of p85 at Tyr688 by kinases like Abl and Src can promote p110β activation (backer2011theregulationof pages 12-14, rathinaswamy2020classiphosphoinositide pages 2-5).


Function
PIK3CB is ubiquitously expressed and is localized in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (gavgani2018classiphosphoinositide pages 1-3, gavgani2018classiphosphoinositide pages 3-5). It functions downstream of both GPCRs and RTKs to activate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which regulates cell growth, survival, proliferation, and metabolism (gavgani2018classiphosphoinositide pages 1-3, li2024targetingpi3kfamily pages 7-8). The lipid product PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 recruits and activates downstream PH domain-containing effectors, including AKT and PDK1 (gavgani2018classiphosphoinositide pages 1-3, nakanishi2016activatingmutationsin pages 1-1). The lipid phosphatase PTEN antagonizes PI3K signaling by dephosphorylating PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (burke2018structuralbasisfor pages 2-4). Key interacting partners include p85 regulatory subunits, Gβγ subunits, Rab5, and the adaptor protein CRKL, which preferentially associates with p110β/p85 complexes (backer2011theregulationof pages 12-14, gavgani2018classiphosphoinositide pages 3-5, gavgani2018classiphosphoinositide pages 5-8). Through its interaction with Rab5, p110β has a kinase-independent scaffolding role in endocytosis (backer2011theregulationof pages 12-14). Its nuclear functions include roles in DNA replication, cell cycle progression, and DNA repair (gavgani2018classiphosphoinositide pages 3-5). Homozygous deletion of PIK3CB is embryonically lethal in mice (ilic2010comparingtheroles pages 5-7).


Inhibitors
Specific inhibitors of p110β include GSK2636771, AZD6482, TGX221, and KIN-193 (burke2018structuralbasisfor pages 2-4, dbouk2013novelapproachesto pages 1-2, miller2019structuraldeterminantsof pages 25-26). It is also targeted by pan-PI3K inhibitors such as GDC-0941 and pictilisib, and dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors like BEZ235 (nakanishi2016activatingmutationsin pages 1-1, pridham2017theroleof pages 2-3).


Other Comments
PIK3CB plays a critical role in tumorigenesis, especially in PTEN-deficient cancers where its activity is essential for cell survival (gavgani2018classiphosphoinositide pages 1-3, li2024targetingpi3kfamily pages 7-8). Overexpression of wild-type p110β can promote oncogenic transformation (gavgani2018classiphosphoinositide pages 3-5, zhao2008classipi3k pages 1-2). While mutations are less common than in PIK3CA, oncogenic gain-of-function mutations in PIK3CB have been identified, including E633K in the helical domain, and D1067Y/V/A, E1051K, L1049R, and A1048V in the kinase domain (li2024targetingpi3kfamily pages 7-8, gavgani2018classiphosphoinositide pages 3-5). Mutations at D1067 enhance basal kinase activity by disrupting the inhibitory interaction with the p85 cSH2 domain and can confer resistance to PI3K inhibitors (nakanishi2016activatingmutationsin pages 9-9, nakanishi2016activatingmutationsin pages 1-1). Germline mutations in the regulatory subunit PIK3R1 that cause Activated PI3K-delta Syndrome 2 (APDS2) can potentially activate p110β, although the resulting immunodeficiency phenotype is largely attributed to p110δ hyperactivation (dornan2017conformationaldisruptionof pages 1-2).
