## Phylogeny
Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a highly conserved serine/threonine protein kinase classified by Manning et al. within the CMGC kinase group, which also includes CDKs, MAPKs, and CLKs (fan2020glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-1, liu2018glycogensynthase‐3 pages 1-3, maixner2013theroleof pages 15-16). Its evolutionary conservation is evidenced by the presence of orthologs across a wide range of eukaryotic species, including mammals, flies (Drosophila), C. elegans, and plants (A. thaliana) (fan2020glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-1, thotala2011gsk3b(glycogensynthase pages 1-3)). Kinase domains between distant species, such as flies and humans, share more than 90% homology (fan2020glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-2). Vertebrates express two main isoforms, GSK-3α and GSK-3β, which are encoded by separate genes and share approximately 98% sequence identity within their catalytic domains (liu2018glycogensynthase‐3 pages 1-3, medina2010glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-2).



## Reaction Catalyzed
The enzymatic reaction catalyzed by GSK-3β is the transfer of the terminal γ-phosphate from ATP to the hydroxyl group of a serine or threonine residue on a substrate protein, yielding ADP and the phosphorylated protein as products (piretti2019structuralandbiophysical pages 14-18, liu2018glycogensynthase‐3 pages 1-3). The reaction is: ATP + substrate protein → ADP + phosphorylated substrate protein (piretti2019structuralandbiophysical pages 14-18).



## Cofactor Requirements
GSK-3β requires Mg²⁺ ions as an essential cofactor for its kinase activity, facilitating ATP binding and catalysis (fan2020glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-1, golpich2015glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 11-11, maixner2013theroleof pages 4-6).



## Substrate Specificity
The substrate specificity of GSK-3β is defined by a consensus motif that typically requires a "priming" phosphorylation event on the substrate (fan2020glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-1). As detailed by Johnson et al., 2023, the kinase favors substrates with a pre-phosphorylated serine or threonine residue located four residues C-terminal to the target site (fan2020glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-1, fan2020glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 2-2). This consensus motif is commonly described as S/T-X-X-X-pS/pT (liu2018glycogensynthase‐3 pages 1-3, medina2010glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-2). The priming phosphate binds to a specific pocket within the kinase domain formed by the critical basic residues Arg96, Arg180, and Lys205 (fan2020glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-2, piretti2019structuralandbiophysical pages 11-14).



## Structure
GSK-3β exhibits a conserved bilobal kinase fold, with an N-terminal lobe rich in β-sheets (residues 25-138) and a C-terminal lobe that is predominantly α-helical (residues 136-343) (piretti2019structuralandbiophysical pages 105-108, piretti2019structuralandbiophysical pages 5-11). The ATP-binding site is located in the cleft between these two lobes (piretti2019structuralandbiophysical pages 5-11). Key regulatory and catalytic features include the activation loop (residues 200-226), which contains the activating phosphorylation site Tyr216 and shapes the substrate binding groove (fan2020glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-1, piretti2019structuralandbiophysical pages 5-11). Two critical structural elements are the hydrophobic spine and the C-helix (liu2018glycogensynthase‐3 pages 1-3, piretti2019structuralandbiophysical pages 14-18). The hydrophobic spine is composed of aligned hydrophobic residues that stabilize the active conformation of the kinase domain, facilitating catalysis (piretti2019structuralandbiophysical pages 105-108, liu2018glycogensynthase‐3 pages 1-3). The C-helix, part of the N-terminal lobe, plays a regulatory role by positioning key residues for catalysis and ATP binding (piretti2019structuralandbiophysical pages 105-108, piretti2019structuralandbiophysical pages 14-18).



## Regulation
GSK-3β is typically constitutively active and is regulated primarily through inhibitory mechanisms, particularly post-translational modifications (medina2010glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-2).
- **Phosphorylation**: The primary regulatory mechanism is dual-site phosphorylation. Phosphorylation at Ser9 in the N-terminal region inhibits GSK-3β activity (fan2020glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-1, golpich2015glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 11-11). This inhibitory phosphorylation is mediated by several upstream kinases, including Akt/PKB (in the insulin/PI3K pathway), PKA, ERK, and p90RSK (fan2020glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-1, fan2020glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 2-3, piretti2019structuralandbiophysical pages 11-14). The phosphorylated Ser9 acts as a pseudosubstrate, binding to the substrate-docking site and preventing access by primed substrates (liu2018glycogensynthase‐3 pages 1-3, medina2010glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-2). Conversely, phosphorylation at Tyr216 within the activation loop is required for full catalytic activity and is thought to occur via autophosphorylation (fan2020glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-1, thotala2011gsk3b(glycogensynthase pages 1-3), seira2014glycogensynthasekinase pages 1-2).
- **Other Modifications**: Other post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination and acetylation, also modulate GSK-3β (fan2020glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 2-2, fan2020glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 2-3). Acetylation can affect ATP binding and reduce Tyr216 autophosphorylation (fan2020glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 2-3).



## Function
GSK-3β is ubiquitously expressed but has particularly high activity and expression in the brain, including the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and cerebellum (fan2020glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-1, fan2020glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-2, seira2014glycogensynthasekinase pages 1-2). Its diverse functions are mediated by the phosphorylation of over 100 substrates (fan2020glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-2).
- **Signaling Pathways**: It is a key regulatory node in the Wnt and insulin signaling pathways (fan2020glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-1, golpich2015glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 11-11). In the Wnt pathway, it phosphorylates β-catenin as part of a destruction complex, targeting it for degradation (fan2020glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 2-2). In the insulin pathway, Akt-mediated inhibition of GSK-3β at Ser9 leads to dephosphorylation and activation of glycogen synthase (GYS1), promoting glycogen synthesis (fan2020glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 2-2, medina2010glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-2).
- **Substrates and Biological Roles**: Key substrates include glycogen synthase, β-catenin, tau protein, transcription factors (e.g., c-Jun, p53, Myc, NFAT, CREB), and splicing factors (fan2020glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 2-2, liu2018glycogensynthase‐3 pages 1-3, thotala2011gsk3b(glycogensynthase pages 1-3)). GSK-3β is involved in regulating neurogenesis, neuronal survival, gene expression, cell cycle, synaptic plasticity, and apoptosis (fan2020glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-2, piretti2019structuralandbiophysical pages 5-11). It also influences alternative mRNA splicing by phosphorylating splicing factors (liu2018glycogensynthase‐3 pages 1-3).



## Inhibitors
GSK-3β is a significant therapeutic target, and several inhibitors are known (fan2020glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-1). Lithium is a clinically used non-competitive inhibitor that acts by competing with Mg²⁺ (medina2010glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 6-6, maixner2013theroleof pages 4-6). A number of experimental ATP-competitive small molecules have been developed, including AR-A014418, SB216763, hymenialdesine, and alsterpaullone (maixner2013theroleof pages 15-16, garcea2007glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 7-8, maixner2013theroleof pages 4-6). More selective, non-ATP competitive inhibitors have also been pursued to reduce off-target effects (fan2020glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 9-10).



## Other Comments
Dysregulation of GSK-3β activity is implicated in a wide range of human diseases (fan2020glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-1). Its strongest links are to neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, bipolar disorder, and depression (fan2020glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-1, golpich2015glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 11-11). In Alzheimer's disease, aberrant GSK-3β activity contributes to the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, a key event in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, and it also influences amyloid-β neurotoxicity (fan2020glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 2-2, medina2010glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 1-2). It is also implicated in diabetes, various cancers (e.g., glioblastoma, pancreatic, ovarian), and neuroinflammatory conditions (thotala2011gsk3b(glycogensynthase pages 4-4), garcea2007glycogensynthasekinase3 pages 7-8).
