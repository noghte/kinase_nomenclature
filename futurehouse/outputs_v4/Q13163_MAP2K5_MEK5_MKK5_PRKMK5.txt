## Phylogeny
MAP2K5 (MEK5) is a dual-specificity protein kinase belonging to the MAP kinase kinase (MAP2K) family (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 1-2, drew2012mek5erk5pathwaythe pages 1-2, min2009thestructureof pages 1-4). Sources are contradictory regarding its assignment to a higher-level kinome group, with some classifying it in the STE (Sterile) kinase group (andrianova2023evolutionaryhistoryof pages 21-27, nakamura2003pb1domainsof pages 5-5) and others in the CMGC group (CDK, MAPK, GSK3, CLK) (drew2012mek5erk5pathwaythe pages 1-2, avruch2007mapkinasepathways pages 1-2). MEK5 is phylogenetically related to MEK1 and MEK2 but is functionally distinct due to its specificity for ERK5 (drew2012mek5erk5pathwaythe pages 14-15, hoang2017oncogenicsignalingof pages 1-5). It shares 30–40% sequence identity with the yeast STE7 kinase, indicating evolutionary conservation, and has orthologs across eukaryotes (avruch2007mapkinasepathways pages 1-2, andrianova2023evolutionaryhistoryof pages 21-27).



## Reaction Catalyzed
As a dual-specificity kinase, MAP2K5 catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of its substrate, ERK5 (MAPK7), on both threonine and tyrosine residues (chen2001mapkinases. pages 20-21, drew2012mek5erk5pathwaythe pages 2-4). The specific residues phosphorylated on ERK5 are threonine 219 and tyrosine 221, located within a TEY motif in the activation loop (paudel2021themek5erk5pathway pages 1-2, wang2006regulationofcellular pages 1-2).

ATP + [ERK5 protein] → ADP + [phospho-ERK5 protein] (drew2012mek5erk5pathwaythe pages 2-4, drew2012mek5erk5pathwaythe pages 1-2)



## Cofactor Requirements
MAP2K5 requires ATP as a phosphate donor cofactor for its kinase activity (drew2012mek5erk5pathwaythe pages 15-17, unknownauthors2017mek5erk5signalingin pages 9-11). MAPKKs like MEK5 also typically require Mg²⁺ or Mn²⁺ for catalysis (drew2012mek5erk5pathwaythe pages 2-4, avruch2007mapkinasepathways pages 1-2).



## Substrate Specificity
MAP2K5 primarily phosphorylates serine/threonine residues that are preceded by a proline (drew2012mek5erk5pathwaythe pages 2-4). However, it also engages in non-Pro-directed phosphorylation events that are distinct from other MAPKs (unknownauthors2017mek5erk5signalingin pages 1-3). Data on substrate specificity show that MEK5 has strong specificity for the ERK phosphorylation site HTGFLTEYVA, phosphorylating the threonine residue within this sequence (johnson2023anatlasof pages 21-23).



## Structure
The AlphaFold predicted structure of MAP2K5 reveals the conserved bilobal kinase fold (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 19-20). This architecture consists of a small N-terminal lobe dominated by a β-sheet and the regulatory αC-helix, and a larger C-terminal lobe composed mostly of α-helices (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 19-20, avruch2007mapkinasepathways pages 5-6). The active site is located in the cleft between these lobes (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 19-20). The N-terminus contains a Phox and Bem1p (PB1) domain required for binding upstream kinases, which is present in the MEK5α isoform but not MEK5β (hoang2017oncogenicsignalingof pages 1-5, drew2012mek5erk5pathwaythe pages 2-4). Key regulatory features include the activation loop (A-loop) in the C-lobe, which controls substrate access, and the hydrophobic spine, a set of conserved residues that align upon activation to maintain structural integrity (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 19-20).



## Regulation
MAP2K5 activation is mediated by post-translational phosphorylation (chen2001mapkinases. pages 20-21). The upstream kinases MEKK2 and MEKK3 phosphorylate MEK5 at Ser311 and Thr315, stimulating its catalytic activity (hoang2017oncogenicsignalingof pages 1-5, unknownauthors2017mek5erk5signalingin pages 1-3). This interaction is dependent on the N-terminal PB1 domain of MEK5 (drew2012mek5erk5pathwaythe pages 2-4, nakamura2003pb1domainsof pages 1-1). Tpl2/Cot-1 and STAT-3 have also been implicated as upstream activators (chen2001mapkinases. pages 20-21, drew2012mek5erk5pathwaythe pages 2-4). Phosphorylation of the activation loop triggers conformational changes, including the inward movement of the regulatory αC-helix to form a critical salt bridge and the stabilization of the hydrophobic spine, which together enable the active conformation (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 19-20).



## Function
MAP2K5 is the sole direct upstream activator of ERK5 (hoang2017oncogenicsignalingof pages 1-5). It functions as a core component of the MEK5/ERK5 signaling pathway, which is activated by diverse stimuli including growth factors (EGF, FGF), cytokines (LIF, IL-6), and cellular stress (oxidative stress, shear stress) (drew2012mek5erk5pathwaythe pages 2-4, paudel2021themek5erk5pathway pages 1-2, simoes2016themek5erk5signalling pages 1-2). MEK5/ERK5 signaling regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, anti-apoptotic signaling, angiogenesis, and cell motility (drew2012mek5erk5pathwaythe pages 1-2, simoes2016themek5erk5signalling pages 1-2). MEK5 and ERK5 are highly expressed in tissues including the heart, brain, lung, skeletal muscle, placenta, and kidney (simoes2016themek5erk5signalling pages 1-2).



## Inhibitors
BIX02188 and BIX02189 are the first reported selective, ATP-competitive Type I inhibitors of MEK5 (cook2020smallmoleculeerk5 pages 3-5, cook2020smallmoleculeerk5 pages 9-11). In vitro kinase assays show potent IC50 values of 4.3 nM for BIX02188 and 1.5 nM for BIX02189 (cook2020smallmoleculeerk5 pages 3-5, drew2012mek5erk5pathwaythe pages 11-12). These compounds inhibit MEK5 kinase activity and suppress downstream ERK5 phosphorylation (drew2012mek5erk5pathwaythe pages 11-12). BIX02188 exhibits off-target activity on Src, CSF1R, KIT, and LCK, while BIX02189 also inhibits FGFR1 and RSK2/4 (cook2020smallmoleculeerk5 pages 3-5, cook2020smallmoleculeerk5 pages 9-11). Another compound, SC-1-181, is a Type III allosteric inhibitor with an IC50 of approximately 10 µM (cook2020smallmoleculeerk5 pages 3-5). Older, less specific inhibitors such as PD98059 and U0126 also show some activity against MEK5 (drew2012mek5erk5pathwaythe pages 11-12). Ponatinib indirectly inhibits MEK5 by targeting its upstream activator MEKK2 (hoang2017oncogenicsignalingof pages 1-5).



## Other Comments
Overexpression and constitutive activation of the MEK5/ERK5 pathway are observed in 20-50% of prostate and breast tumors and are linked to aggressive tumor growth, chemoresistance, and metastasis (drew2012mek5erk5pathwaythe pages 1-2). The pathway is also implicated in cardiovascular diseases like atherosclerosis (paudel2021themek5erk5pathway pages 1-2). Genetic knockout of MEK5 or ERK5 in mice is embryonically lethal, causing severe defects in cardiac development and angiogenesis (simoes2016themek5erk5signalling pages 1-2). Specific disease-related mutations in MEK5 have not been well defined (drew2012mek5erk5pathwaythe pages 1-2).
