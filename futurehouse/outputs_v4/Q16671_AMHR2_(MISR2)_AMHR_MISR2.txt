Phylogeny  
• Orthologous genes have been cloned in Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Oryctolagus cuniculus, Gallus gallus, Danio rerio and Xenopus laevis, demonstrating conservation across vertebrates (josso2003transductionpathwayof pages 2-3, howard2022molecularmechanismsof pages 1-2).  
• AMHR2 shares < 30 % sequence identity with the type-II receptors ACVR2A, ACVR2B, BMPR2 and TGFβR2, defining a distinct clade within the serine/threonine kinase receptor type-II (STKR-II) family (rak2019antimullerianhormonereceptor pages 3-5).  
• Sequence similarity to its closest paralogues is ~20 %, and the receptor has evolved as the only dedicated type-II receptor for a single TGF-β family ligand (AMH) (unknownauthors2022structuralandfunctional pages 80-83, hart2021structureofamh pages 1-1).  
• Structural and sequence analyses place AMHR2 in the STKR-II group of the human kinome (cate2022antimüllerianhormonesignal pages 6-8).  

Reaction Catalyzed  
ATP + [type I receptor]-Ser/Thr → ADP + [type I receptor]-O-phospho-Ser/Thr (josso2003transductionpathwayof pages 2-3).  

Cofactor Requirements  
Catalytic activity requires Mg²⁺ coordinated by the conserved HRD and DFG motifs of the kinase domain (howard2022molecularmechanismsof pages 1-2, cate2022antimüllerianhormonesignal pages 6-8).  

Substrate Specificity  
• Direct substrates: BMP-type I receptors ALK2 (ACVR1), ALK3 (BMPR1A) and ALK6 (BMPR1B); phosphorylation of these receptors triggers Smad1/5/9 activation (unknownauthors2022structuralandfunctional pages 43-46, cate2022antimüllerianhormonesignal pages 6-8).  
• A linear consensus phosphorylation motif for AMHR2 has not been defined; no Johnson-2023 atlas entry is available (unknownauthors2022structuralandfunctional pages 43-46).  

Structure  
• Domain organisation: signal peptide, 127-residue extracellular ligand-binding domain (three-finger toxin fold with five intramolecular disulfides), single transmembrane helix, and ~403-residue intracellular serine/threonine kinase domain (rak2019antimullerianhormonereceptor pages 3-5).  
• Extracellular complex: crystal structure of AMH bound to AMHR2 ECD at 2.6 Å (PDB 7L0J/7L0I) reveals a 933 Å² buried interface, a finger-1 loop extension unique to AMHR2, and a receptor shift of ~7.5 Å relative to Activin/BMP complexes (hart2021structureofamh pages 1-1, unknownauthors2022structuralandfunctional pages 73-76, unknownauthors2022structuralandfunctional pages 80-83).  
• Key contact elements include a Lys534AMH–Asp81/Glu84AMHR2 salt bridge and receptor residues Phe62, Met76, Asp81, Leu106 and Thr108; mutation of these sites substantially impairs signaling (unknownauthors2022structuralandfunctional pages 69-73, hart2020mutationalanalysisof pages 6-7).  
• Disulfide connectivity differs from other receptors by linking the finger 2/3 loop to finger 2, contributing to ligand specificity (unknownauthors2022structuralandfunctional pages 80-83).  
• Kinase domain: no crystal structure; sequence predicts a bilobal STKR-II fold with VAIK, HRD and DFG catalytic motifs, a regulatory C-helix, GS box and activation loop (cate2022antimüllerianhormonesignal pages 6-8). AlphaFold modelling supports this topology (howard2022molecularmechanismsof pages 1-2).  

Regulation  
• Two N-glycosylation sites in the ECD facilitate proper folding (josso2003transductionpathwayof pages 2-3).  
• Proteolytic cleavage removing most of the ECD generates inactive oligomers retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (rak2019antimullerianhormonereceptor pages 3-5).  
• Alternative splicing yields at least three isoforms with divergent C-termini (rak2019antimullerianhormonereceptor pages 3-5).  
• Activation requires formation of a heterotetramer with ALK2/3/6; AMHR2 phosphorylates the GS loop of the type I receptor, which then autophosphorylates and recruits Smad substrates (cate2022antimüllerianhormonesignal pages 6-8).  
• SMURF family E3 ubiquitin ligases mediate ubiquitination and degradation of type-II receptors, likely restraining AMHR2 signaling amplitude (howard2022molecularmechanismsof pages 1-2).  
• Inhibitory Smads 6/7 attenuate downstream signaling (josso2003transductionpathwayof pages 2-3).  

Function  
• Expression is largely restricted to reproductive tissues: fetal Sertoli cells, mesenchyme surrounding the Müllerian duct, and ovarian granulosa cells (unknownauthors2022structuralandfunctional pages 18-22, josso2003transductionpathwayof pages 2-3).  
• Male fetal development: AMHR2 mediates AMH-induced Müllerian duct regression (hart2021structureofamh pages 1-1).  
• Female ovary: signaling limits primordial follicle recruitment and modulates folliculogenesis (unknownauthors2022structuralandfunctional pages 69-73).  
• Canonical pathway: AMH binding → AMHR2 dimerisation with ALK2/3/6 → Smad1/5/9 phosphorylation → gene transcription (unknownauthors2022structuralandfunctional pages 43-46).  
• Non-canonical signaling: AMHR2 can activate NF-κB independently of Smads in certain cell types (rak2019antimullerianhormonereceptor pages 3-5).  

Other Comments  
• Biallelic loss-of-function variants cause persistent Müllerian duct syndrome (PMDS); a recurrent 27-bp deletion in exon 10 and missense mutations at Met76 and Asp81 impair receptor function (rak2019antimullerianhormonereceptor pages 3-5, hart2020mutationalanalysisof pages 9-10).  
• Conservative substitutions M76V or D81E retain in-vitro signaling yet are reported in PMDS cohorts, indicating additional pathogenic mechanisms such as misfolding or trafficking defects (unknownauthors2022structuralandfunctional pages 46-50).  
• Reduced AMHR2 activity has been implicated in polycystic ovary syndrome (unknownauthors2022structuralandfunctional pages 69-73).
