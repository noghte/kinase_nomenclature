Phylogeny  
• Kinome classification: Tyrosine Kinase (TK) group, Eph receptor family, A-class subgroup (tang2020ephreceptorsas pages 1-4).  
• Evolutionary relationships: clusters with EphA2, EphA7 and EphA8 in phylogenetic trees (aasheim2005characterizationofa pages 1-2); shares catalytic-site substitutions with the kinase-dead receptor EphB6 (truitt2011dancingwiththe pages 5-6).  
• Orthologs: mouse Epha10 (88 % nucleotide and 91 % amino-acid identity to human EPHA10) (aasheim2005characterizationofa pages 3-5). No additional orthologs reported in the cited literature.

Reaction Catalyzed  
ATP + [protein]-L-tyrosyl → ADP + [protein]-L-tyrosyl-phosphate (tang2020ephreceptorsas pages 1-4).  
Note: EPHA10 cannot catalyze this reaction because the VAIK, HRD and DFG motifs are replaced by VAVH, HRG and GFG, respectively (truitt2011dancingwiththe pages 5-6).

Cofactor Requirements  
Active Eph kinases require divalent cations such as Mg²⁺ or Mn²⁺ for phosphotransfer (tang2020ephreceptorsas pages 1-4). No cofactor dependence has been demonstrated for EPHA10 owing to its catalytic inactivity (truitt2011dancingwiththe pages 5-6).

Substrate Specificity  
No intrinsic substrate motif or phosphotyrosine preference has been reported for EPHA10; substrate specificity remains undefined (truitt2011dancingwiththe pages 5-6, shin2020thecatalyticallydefective pages 11-11).

Structure  
• Domain organisation: N-terminal ligand-binding domain, cysteine-rich/Sushi-EGF module, two fibronectin type-III repeats, single transmembrane helix, juxtamembrane segment, intracellular pseudokinase domain, SAM domain, and C-terminal PDZ-binding motif (unknownauthors2016…interactand pages 1-2, toracchio2024epha2incancer pages 1-2).  
• Catalytic-site substitutions: VAVH (β3-lysine region), HRG (catalytic loop) and GFG (activation loop) abolish phosphotransfer activity (truitt2011dancingwiththe pages 5-6).  
• Isoforms: full-length receptor, a transmembrane variant lacking the SAM domain, a soluble ectodomain, and additional 48 kDa, 50 kDa and 86 kDa species detected in breast cells (aasheim2005characterizationofa pages 1-2, unknownauthors2016…interactand pages 2-4).  
• Biophysical properties: intracellular regions are conformationally flexible and can bind ATP or ATP-competitive small molecules despite catalytic inactivity (liang2021theintracellulardomains pages 1-2).  
• No high-resolution crystal or cryo-EM structure has been published; current information derives from domain prediction and biophysical studies (liang2021theintracellulardomains pages 1-2).

Regulation  
• Heterodimerisation with catalytically active EphA7 leads to EPHA10 cross-phosphorylation and complex formation (unknownauthors2016…interactand pages 7-8).  
• Phosphorylated juxtamembrane tyrosines recruit SH2-domain proteins Abl, Src and Vav3 (liang2021theintracellulardomains pages 1-2).  
• EPHA10 expression enhances p38 MAPK phosphorylation (unknownauthors2016…interactand pages 1-2).  
• Alternative splicing that removes the SAM domain modulates oligomerisation potential (aasheim2005characterizationofa pages 1-2).  
• Specific phosphorylation or ubiquitination sites and the enzymes responsible have not been mapped.

Function  
• Expression patterns: high expression in testis with negligible levels in other normal adult tissues (aasheim2005characterizationofa pages 5-6). Over-expression documented in breast, pancreatic, prostate and non-small-cell lung cancers (unknownauthors2016…interactand pages 2-4, shin2020thecatalyticallydefective pages 10-11, wang2024comprehensiveanalysisof pages 6-9).  
• Ligand binding: highest affinity for ephrin-A3; lower affinity for ephrin-A1, A2, A4 and A5 (aasheim2005characterizationofa pages 5-6, truitt2011dancingwiththe pages 5-6).  
• Interacting partners: EphA7 (heterodimerisation) (unknownauthors2016…interactand pages 7-8); SH2-adaptors Abl, Src and Vav3 via phosphorylated JM region (liang2021theintracellulardomains pages 1-2).  
• Signalling outputs: increased p38 activation (unknownauthors2016…interactand pages 1-2) and up-regulation of PD-L1 expression contributing to immune evasion in tumour cells (shin2020thecatalyticallydefective pages 10-11).

Inhibitors  
Neutralising monoclonal antibodies and antibody–drug conjugates targeting EPHA10 have been generated and evaluated in pre-clinical cancer models (shin2020thecatalyticallydefective pages 10-11).

Other Comments  
• Breast cancer: EPHA10 over-expression correlates with lymph-node metastasis (anderton2021theroleof pages 5-6); nuclear localisation in invasive breast cells is suppressed by the metastasis inhibitor EphB6 (unknownauthors2016…interactand pages 7-8).  
• Pancreatic cancer: EPHA10 promotes tumourigenesis in cell and xenograft models (shin2020thecatalyticallydefective pages 10-11).  
• NSCLC: high EPHA10 transcript levels associate with poor prognosis and altered immune infiltration (wang2024comprehensiveanalysisof pages 6-9).  
• Isoform-specific modulation of E-cadherin/β-catenin complexes reported in breast cancer (buckens2020theroleof pages 31-34).
