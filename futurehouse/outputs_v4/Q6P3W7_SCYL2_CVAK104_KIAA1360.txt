## Phylogeny
SCYL2 is a member of the SCY1-like (SCYL) family of proteins, which is evolutionarily conserved and in mammals consists of three members: SCYL1, SCYL2, and SCYL3 (kuliyev2018overlappingroleof pages 1-2, gingras2015scyl2protectsca3 pages 11-12). Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the human kinome by Manning et al., SCYL2 is classified within the 'Other' group of kinases and is characterized as a pseudokinase (manning2002theproteinkinase pages 5-6, boudeau2006emergingrolesof pages 1-2, jacobsen2017thesecretlife pages 1-2).



## Reaction Catalyzed
The catalytic activity of SCYL2 is unconfirmed, and reports are contradictory. Most studies classify SCYL2 as a catalytically inactive pseudokinase, as no experimentally verified phosphoryl transfer reaction has been reported (boudeau2006emergingrolesof pages 1-2, burman2008scyl1mutatedin pages 12-12). In vitro kinase assays using recombinant and endogenous SCYL2 failed to demonstrate autophosphorylation or phosphorylation of substrates such as auxilin, histone H1, MBP, clathrin, or adaptor proteins (unknownauthors2006functionalpropertiesof pages 73-78). In contrast, one study identified SCYL2 (as CVAK104) as a poly-L-lysine stimulated serine/threonine kinase capable of autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of the β2-adaptin subunit of the AP2 adaptor complex in vitro (conner2005cvak104isa pages 1-2).



## Cofactor Requirements
Information regarding specific cofactor requirements for SCYL2 activity is not available in the provided context.



## Substrate Specificity
Direct phosphorylation targets and substrate specificity for SCYL2 have not been definitively established (boudeau2006emergingrolesof pages 1-2, boudeau2006emergingrolesof pages 2-4). A comprehensive analysis by Johnson et al. (2023) reported that no consensus substrate motif could be identified for SCYL2, a finding consistent with its classification as a pseudokinase (burman2008scyl1mutatedin pages 1-1, gingras2015scyl2protectsca3 pages 12-12, jacobsen2017thesecretlife pages 1-2). One study reported that SCYL2 phosphorylates the β2-adaptin subunit of the AP2 complex in vitro (conner2005cvak104isa pages 1-2).



## Structure
SCYL2 has a multi-domain architecture featuring an N-terminal pseudokinase domain (or serine/threonine kinase homology domain, residues 32-327) and C-terminal HEAT (Huntingtin, elongation factor 3, protein phosphatase 2A, yeast kinase TOR1) repeats that mediate protein-protein interactions (boudeau2006emergingrolesof pages 1-2, boudeau2006emergingrolesof pages 2-4, unknownauthors2006functionalpropertiesof pages 73-78). The protein also contains a central coiled-coil domain and a poorly structured C-terminal region (unknownauthors2006functionalpropertiesof pages 73-78). The protein kinase-like domain contains inactivating substitutions in conserved catalytic motifs essential for kinase activity, such as VAIK, HRD, and DFG (boudeau2006emergingrolesof pages 1-2, jacobsen2017thesecretlife pages 1-2). Specific mutations include variations in the β3 Lys residue and the HxD and DFG motifs; for example, the catalytically critical aspartic acid at position 135 is replaced by an asparagine (unknownauthors2014biochemicalanalysisof pages 29-33, unknownauthors2006functionalpropertiesof pages 73-78). Despite its lack of confirmed catalytic activity, SCYL2 has demonstrated ATP-binding capacity (unknownauthors2006functionalpropertiesof pages 73-78). The three-dimensional organization of SCYL2 has been modeled by AlphaFold (UniProt Q6P3W7) (boudeau2006emergingrolesof pages 1-2, burman2008scyl1mutatedin pages 1-1, jacobsen2017thesecretlife pages 1-2).



## Regulation
Regulatory post-translational modifications (PTMs) modulate the function of SCYL2, but specific modifications and their sites have not been conclusively characterized (boudeau2006emergingrolesof pages 1-2, kumar2022pseudokinasenrp1facilitates pages 13-14). One study reported that the in vitro kinase activity of SCYL2 is stimulated by poly-L-lysine (conner2005cvak104isa pages 1-2).



## Function
SCYL2 is ubiquitously expressed and functions as a regulatory or scaffold protein in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and vesicular trafficking, with localization to the Golgi apparatus, trans-Golgi network (TGN), and endosomes (kuliyev2018overlappingroleof pages 1-2, jacobsen2017thesecretlife pages 1-2, jung2017scyl2genesare pages 1-6). It interacts directly with core components of the endocytic machinery, including the clathrin heavy chain and the AP1 and AP2 adaptor complexes (boudeau2006emergingrolesof pages 1-2, gingras2015scyl2protectsca3 pages 11-12). Its role is considered accessory or regulatory rather than core to clathrin-mediated functions (gingras2015scyl2protectsca3 pages 11-12). In the nervous system, SCYL2 is essential for neuronal function, signaling, and survival (boudeau2006emergingrolesof pages 1-2, kuliyev2018overlappingroleof pages 1-2). It protects hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons from excitotoxicity by regulating the synaptic expression of excitatory glutamate receptor subunits, such as NR1 and KA1 (gingras2015scyl2protectsca3 pages 11-12).



## Other Comments
Pathogenic missense mutations in SCYL2 are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (boudeau2006emergingrolesof pages 1-2, unknownauthors2014biochemicalanalysisof pages 29-33). These pathogenic variants often affect the pseudokinase domain, disrupting regulatory protein interactions and intracellular trafficking, which contributes to disease phenotypes (boudeau2006emergingrolesof pages 1-2, unknownauthors2014biochemicalanalysisof pages 29-33). The loss of SCYL2 in mice results in severe neurological defects, including degeneration of hippocampal CA3 neurons and early death due to an impaired suckling behavior (kuliyev2018overlappingroleof pages 1-2).
