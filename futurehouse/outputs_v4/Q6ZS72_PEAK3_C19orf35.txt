## Phylogeny  
Orthologous PEAK3 proteins are documented in Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Gallus gallus, Danio rerio and Xenopus laevis, demonstrating conservation across vertebrates (hou2021peak3pseudokinaserepresents pages 1-3).  
Additional homologues occur in Monodelphis domestica, Alligator mississippiensis and Taeniopygia guttata, whereas the gene has been lost from several Squamata lineages, including snakes and lizards (lopez2019peak3c19orf35pseudokinasea pages 2-3).  
A RefSeq-based survey retrieved 251 PEAK3 homologues that form a discrete clade once PEAK1 and PEAK2 sequences are excluded, confirming paralogue distinction (torosyan2023structuralinsightsinto pages 14-15).  
Within the human kinome, PEAK3 belongs to the atypical New Kinase Family 3 (NKF3) pseudokinase branch, which was not catalogued in the original Manning 2002 classification because of extensive catalytic-motif degeneration; it clusters with PEAK1/SgK269 and PEAK2/Pragmin (lopez2019peak3c19orf35pseudokinasea pages 9-9).  

## Reaction Catalyzed  
Protein-L-tyrosine + ATP → Protein-L-tyrosine-phosphate + ADP.  
No phosphotransfer activity has been detected; an inhibitory triad blocks nucleotide access and key catalytic residues are substituted (lopez2019peak3c19orf35pseudokinasea pages 4-4, torosyan2023structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2).  

## Cofactor Requirements  
No divalent-cation requirement is observed because enzymatic activity is absent (lopez2019peak3c19orf35pseudokinasea pages 4-4).  

## Substrate Specificity  
No substrate specificity has been defined; kinase assays have failed to detect catalytic activity (unknownauthors2019functionalcharacterizationof pages 36-41).  

## Structure  
Domain organisation  
• N-terminal intrinsically disordered region (~130 aa) containing a high-affinity CrkII SH3N binding motif (PPPLPK) and a 14-3-3 docking motif centred on Ser69 (roy2023structuralmappingof pages 1-3).  
• Split Helical Dimerisation (SHED) module composed of helices αN, αJ, αK and αL that mediates obligate homodimerisation and permits heterodimerisation with PEAK1/2 (lopez2019peak3c19orf35pseudokinasea pages 2-3).  
• C-terminal pseudokinase domain retaining an intact DFG motif but harbouring an HRD→LxE substitution; residues D184/Y187/L201/Q231/L311 occlude the nucleotide pocket (lopez2019peak3c19orf35pseudokinasea pages 4-4).  

3-D structural data  
Cryo-EM structures of the PEAK3 homodimer bound to an endogenous 14-3-3 heterodimer have been deposited (PDB 6GN0, 6GNK, 6GNJ, 6GN8, 6GNN); the map reveals an asymmetric 14-3-3 engagement spanning the SHED and pseudokinase lobes (torosyan2023structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2, torosyan2023structuralinsightsinto pages 14-15).  
Homology modelling based on the Pragmin SHED/pseudokinase crystal structure (PDB 5VE6) was used to map the inhibitory triad and dimer interface (lopez2019peak3c19orf35pseudokinasea pages 4-4).  
The activation loop is fully ordered yet unphosphorylated, the αC helix adopts a closed conformation, and the intact DFG motif contributes to dimer stability rather than catalysis (torosyan2023structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2).  
A secondary PEAK3-specific interface supplements the canonical phospho-Ser69/14-3-3 groove interaction (torosyan2023structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2).  

## Regulation  
Post-translational modifications  
• Ser69 phosphorylation by PKD family kinases creates a high-affinity 14-3-3 binding site, resulting in cytoplasmic sequestration and reduced nuclear localisation (torosyan2023structuralinsightsinto pages 10-11).  
• Tyr24 phosphorylation by Src family kinases following EGF stimulation generates SH2 docking sites for Grb2 and ASAP1; PTPN12 rapidly removes this modification (hou2021peak3pseudokinaserepresents pages 1-3).  
• Ubiquitination by the E3 ligase SIAH1 has been reported and is implicated in regulating protein stability (lopez2019peak3c19orf35pseudokinasea pages 9-9).  

Allosteric and conformational control  
SHED-dependent homodimerisation is required for high-affinity CrkII binding; mutation of the DFG aspartate or SHED helices disrupts both dimer formation and adaptor engagement (unknownauthors2019functionalcharacterizationof pages 47-53).  
14-3-3 binding sterically competes with CrkII and PP2A, thereby rewiring the interactome and modulating subcellular localisation (torosyan2023structuralinsightsinto pages 10-11).  

## Function  
Expression patterns  
RNA-seq and immunohistochemistry data indicate predominant expression in granulocytes, monocytes and other lymphoid-lineage cells, with limited expression in most tissues (ounoughene2021sheddependentoncogenicsignaling pages 2-4, roy2023structuralmappingof pages 1-3).  

Interacting partners and pathway context  
Validated interactors include CrkII, CrkL, multiple 14-3-3 isoforms, Grb2, ASAP1/2, Cbl, PYK2 and EGFR, identified by co-immunoprecipitation and quantitative mass spectrometry (lopez2019peak3c19orf35pseudokinasea pages 4-4, hou2021peak3pseudokinaserepresents pages 3-5, torosyan2023structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2).  
Upstream regulators comprise Src (Tyr24) and PKD (Ser69), whereas downstream signalling involves inhibition of CrkII-dependent membrane ruffling and activation of a PEAK3-PYK2-AKT axis that drives motility and invasion in epithelial cells (ounoughene2021sheddependentoncogenicsignaling pages 2-4, hou2021peak3pseudokinaserepresents pages 1-3).  
Over-expression in MCF-10A mammary epithelial cells promotes elongation, migration and invasive 3-D acinar growth; these phenotypes require SHED-mediated dimerisation and Tyr24 phosphorylation (hou2021peak3pseudokinaserepresents pages 1-3).  

## Other Comments  
PEAK3 mRNA is significantly up-regulated in acute myeloid leukaemia patient samples, particularly in M4/M5 subtypes, and the protein interacts with SIAH1, an E3 ligase implicated in FLT3-ITD turnover (ounoughene2021sheddependentoncogenicsignalling pages 8-12, unknownauthors2019functionalcharacterizationof pages 57-61, lopez2019peak3c19orf35pseudokinasea pages 9-9).  
Mutation D330N within the DFG motif impairs dimerisation, CrkII binding and functional inhibition of membrane ruffling, underscoring the importance of the pseudoactive site for scaffold integrity (unknownauthors2019functionalcharacterizationof pages 47-53).
