## Phylogeny
UHMK1 is a serine/threonine kinase classified within the human kinome (manning2002theproteinkinase pages 1-2). One source classifies it within the AGC kinase family (arfelli2023uhmk1isa pages 19-20), while other sources suggest it aligns with the CMGC group (cyclin-dependent, MAP, GSK3, CDK-like kinases) based on its proline-directed substrate preference and functional roles (arfelli2023uhmk1isa pages 1-2, manning2002theproteinkinase pages 7-8, unknownauthors2008moleculargeneticsof pages 166-170). The protein is highly conserved evolutionarily; protein identity is >99% with primates and other mammals, 99.3% with rodents (*Mus musculus*, *Rattus norvegicus*), 88.2% with *Gallus gallus* (chicken), and 73.6% with *Danio rerio* (zebrafish) (arfelli2018uhmk1(u2afhomology pages 20-22). Its U2AF homology motif (UHM) is evolutionarily adapted from RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) to mediate protein-protein interactions (arfelli2023uhmk1isa pages 1-2).



## Reaction Catalyzed
UHMK1 catalyzes the ATP-dependent transfer of a γ-phosphate group to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins (manning2002theproteinkinase pages 1-2, arfelli2023uhmk1isa pages 19-20).



## Cofactor Requirements
The catalytic activity of UHMK1 is dependent on Mg²⁺ as a cofactor (arfelli2018uhmk1(u2afhomology pages 15-17, arfelli2023uhmk1isa pages 19-20, francone2010signalingfromthe pages 1-2, unknownauthors2008moleculargeneticsof pages 166-170).



## Substrate Specificity
UHMK1 preferentially phosphorylates proline-directed serine residues (arfelli2018uhmk1(u2afhomology pages 17-18, arfelli2023uhmk1isa pages 1-2, arfelli2023uhmk1isa pages 1-2, unknownauthors2008moleculargeneticsof pages 166-170). pLogo motif analysis of phosphoproteomic data identified a consensus phosphorylation motif of [R]-X(0,3)-S-P-[E/D/Q] (arfelli2023uhmk1isa pages 5-6). This analysis revealed proline at the +1 position in 41.67% of sites, with a significant enrichment of arginine (R) at position -3 and glutamic acid (E) at positions -4, +2, and +3 (arfelli23uhmk1isa pages 5-6). UHMK1 was among 303 human serine/threonine kinases whose substrate specificity was profiled using positional scanning peptide arrays, though a specific motif from this study is not detailed in the provided context (johnson2023anatlasof pages 1-2).



## Structure
UHMK1 consists of an N-terminal kinase core of 282 amino acids and a C-terminal U2AF homology motif (UHM) of 100 amino acids (arfelli2018uhmk1(u2afhomology pages 17-18). The kinase domain confers catalytic activity, for which Lysine 54 (K54) is essential (arfelli2018uhmk1(u2afhomology pages 17-18). The C-terminal UHM domain is a protein-protein interaction module that binds to UHM-ligand motifs (ULMs) found in substrates, particularly splicing factors (arfelli2018uhmk1(u2afhomology pages 17-18, arfelli2023uhmk1isa pages 5-6). No experimentally determined 3D structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) are mentioned in the context; computational models from AlphaFold are referenced (arfelli2023uhmk1isa pages 5-6, johnson2023anatlasof pages 1-2). Information regarding key catalytic and regulatory features such as the activation loop, C-helix, or hydrophobic spine is not available in the provided sources.



## Regulation
UHMK1 is regulated at the transcriptional and post-translational levels. Its transcription is activated by transcription factors GABP and FOXM1 and is promoted by WDR5, a component of the KMT2A/SETD1A methyltransferase complex that mediates H3K4 trimethylation at the UHMK1 promoter (arfelli2018uhmk1(u2afhomology pages 17-18). UHMK1 expression levels accumulate in the G1 phase and decrease during the S phase of the cell cycle (arfelli2018uhmk1(u2afhomology pages 17-18). Mitogenic stimulation activates UHMK1 via autophosphorylation (unknownauthors2008moleculargeneticsof pages 170-175).

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) identified on UHMK1 include phosphorylation at sites Y197, S283, and S290, and ubiquitination at lysines K190, K282, K383, and K387 (arfelli2018uhmk1(u2afhomology pages 17-18). However, the functional consequences of these specific phosphorylation and ubiquitination events on UHMK1 activity, localization, or stability are not clarified in the provided sources (arfelli2018uhmk1(u2afhomology pages 17-18). Upstream signaling pathways involving Akt, FGF-2, PI 3-kinase/Rac1, and ERK1/2 also regulate UHMK1 functions (arfelli2018uhmk1(u2afhomology pages 15-17, arfelli2018uhmk1(u2afhomology pages 22-23).



## Function
UHMK1 is a kinase that localizes to both the nucleus and cytoplasm and is ubiquitously expressed, with enriched levels in the nervous system (especially the hippocampus) and hematopoietic cells (arfelli2018uhmk1(u2afhomology pages 18-20, arfelli2018uhmk1(u2afhomology pages 17-18, francone2010signalingfromthe pages 1-2).

UHMK1's functions are mediated by phosphorylation of specific substrates:
*   **RNA Processing and Splicing:** It phosphorylates splicing factors SF1 and SF3B1 to enhance early spliceosome assembly and regulates over 270 alternative splicing events (arfelli2018uhmk1(u2afhomology pages 18-20, arfelli2023uhmk1isa pages 1-2). This phosphorylation of SF1 enhances its binding to U2AF65 (arfelli2018uhmk1(u2afhomology pages 22-23). Other substrates in this pathway include SUGP1, hnRNP M, and PRRC2B (arfelli2023uhmk1isa pages 9-11).
*   **Cell Cycle Progression:** In response to mitogenic signals, UHMK1 phosphorylates the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 (CDKN1B) on Ser10, leading to its nuclear export and subsequent proteasomal degradation, which facilitates progression through the G1 phase (arfelli2018uhmk1(u2afhomology pages 18-20, barbutti2018theu2afhomology pages 16-20, arfelli2023uhmk1isa pages 1-2).
*   **Cytoskeletal Dynamics and Cell Migration:** UHMK1 phosphorylates the microtubule destabilizer Stathmin (STMN) on Ser38, which targets STMN for degradation, thereby impacting microtubule dynamics and negatively regulating cell migration (arfelli2018uhmk1(u2afhomology pages 18-20, arfelli2023uhmk1isa pages 1-2).
*   **Neuronal and Secretory Function:** UHMK1 phosphorylates peptidylglycine α-amidating mono-oxygenase (PAM) on Ser949, a modification essential for proper protein trafficking in the secretory pathway and for regulating the nuclear localization of a PAM fragment (arfelli2018uhmk1(u2afhomology pages 20-22, unknownauthors2008moleculargeneticsof pages 170-175). In neurons, it associates with RNA granule components such as KIF3A and NONO and modulates the translation of transported mRNAs like β-actin (arfelli2018uhmk1(u2afhomology pages 18-20).

UHMK1 interacts with the proliferation marker PIMREG (FAM64A/CATS) and the transcription factor MYBL2 (arfelli2018uhmk1(u2afhomology pages 20-22, arfelli2023uhmk1isa pages 1-2). It also phosphorylates other kinases (PIK3C3, WNK1, NUCKS1, PRPF4B) and a phosphatase (PPP4R2), indicating a broader role in signaling networks (arfelli2023uhmk1isa pages 9-11).



## Inhibitors
No specific chemical inhibitors of UHMK1 are described in the provided context (arfelli2018uhmk1(u2afhomology pages 20-22, barbutti2018theu2afhomology pages 16-20, arfelli2018uhmk1(u2afhomology pages 22-23). UHMK1 expression is inhibited by the EGFR-targeting antibody trastuzumab (arfelli2018uhmk1(u2afhomology pages 20-22). The antipsychotic drug clozapine, but not haloperidol, downregulates UHMK1 expression in mice (unknownauthors2008moleculargeneticsof pages 170-175). Depletion of UHMK1 sensitizes EGFR-positive breast cancer cells to the kinase inhibitor erlotinib (arfelli2018uhmk1(u2afhomology pages 20-22).



## Other Comments
UHMK1 is associated with several human diseases. Higher UHMK1 transcript levels are observed in neurofibromatosis type 1-related tumors (arfelli2018uhmk1(u2afhomology pages 20-22). It is implicated in breast cancer, vascular remodeling, and neointima formation (arfelli2018uhmk1(u2afhomology pages 20-22). A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the UHMK1 locus linked to bone mineral density (arfelli2018uhmk1(u2afhomology pages 20-22, arfelli2018uhmk1(u2afhomology pages 22-23). An association with schizophrenia has been proposed but is considered controversial (arfelli2018uhmk1(u2afhomology pages 20-22).

No recurrent somatic mutations in UHMK1 have been identified in diseases like myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (barbutti2018theu2afhomology pages 16-20). The COSMIC database reports over 160 unique somatic mutations in various cancers, though their significance is not detailed (arfelli2018uhmk1(u2afhomology pages 20-22).

*Uhmk1* knockout mice exhibit disease-relevant phenotypes, including locomotor hyperactivity, reduced learning capacity, altered SF1 phosphorylation, and aberrant RNA splicing (arfelli2018uhmk1(u2afhomology pages 18-20).
