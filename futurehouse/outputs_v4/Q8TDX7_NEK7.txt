## Phylogeny  
Human NEK7 is assigned to the NEK sub-family within the CMGC group of the human kinome as defined by Manning et al. 2002 (bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 24-25).  
Within the NEK clade it is most closely related to NEK6 (≈86 % catalytic-domain identity) and operates downstream of the upstream activator NEK9 (liu2020nek7apotential pages 1-2).  
Experimentally verified orthologs exist in mouse, rat, zebrafish and Drosophila, and the Aspergillus nidulans NIMA kinase represents a conserved fungal counterpart (bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 24-25, oregan2007mitoticregulationby pages 6-8).  

## Reaction Catalyzed  
ATP + protein-Ser/Thr ⇌ ADP + protein-O-phospho-Ser/Thr (bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 29-30).  

## Cofactor Requirements  
Dependence on divalent cations has not been explicitly reported for NEK7 in the cited literature (bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 29-30).  

## Substrate Specificity  
Oriented peptide library screening defined a family consensus [L/M/F/W]-X-X-S/T-[no Pro+1] for NEKs; NEK7 adds a bias for acidic residues at −1 and hydrophobic residues (Leu/Phe) at +3 (kooij2019comprehensivesubstratespecificity pages 4-5).  
Additional preferences include phospho-tyrosine at −1 and tryptophan at +4, features validated by in vitro peptide phosphorylation (kooij2019comprehensivesubstratespecificity pages 5-6, kooij2019comprehensivesubstratespecificity pages 16-18).  
The Johnson 2023 kinome atlas does not report a NEK7 motif (kooij2019comprehensivesubstratespecificity pages 3-4).  
Cellular substrates that conform to these preferences include EML4-Ser146, TRF1-Ser114, kinesins KIF11/KIF14, Eg5-Ser1033 and RPS6KB1 (bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 14-15, bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 15-17).  

## Structure  
NEK7 is a 302-residue monomer composed of a short disordered N-terminus and a canonical bilobal serine/threonine kinase domain (liu2020nek7apotential pages 1-2).  
Crystal structures (PDB 2WQN, 5SY1) reveal a five-stranded β-sheet N-lobe and an α-helical C-lobe linked by a flexible hinge; Tyr97 protrudes into the active site, enforcing autoinhibition (byrne2020nek7conformationalflexibility pages 12-13).  
The regulatory spine (His159-Leu180-Leu86-Tyr97) is fully stacked only after Ser195 phosphorylation or engineered aromatic substitutions (byrne2020nek7conformationalflexibility pages 3-4).  
Key catalytic features include Lys81–Glu97 salt-bridge formation upon activation and an activation loop that harbours Thr169 and Ser195 (byrne2020nek7conformationalflexibility pages 12-13).  
Cryo-EM of the NEK7-NLRP3 complex (PDB 6NPY) shows the NEK7 C-lobe docking onto NLRP3 LRR and NACHT domains while the N-lobe remains flexible, explaining kinase-activity-independent licensing (sharif2019structuralmechanismfor pages 1-2, fu2023structuralmechanismsof pages 5-7).  

## Regulation  
• Ser195 phosphorylation by NEK9 stabilises the regulatory spine and activates the kinase (byrne2020nek7conformationalflexibility pages 12-13).  
• Thr169 undergoes autophosphorylation within the activation loop (kooij2019comprehensivesubstratespecificity pages 28-29).  
• Reactive-oxygen-species-induced phosphorylation enhances NLRP3 binding (shi2016nlrp3activationand pages 4-6).  
• Tyr97 mediates autoinhibition; Y97F mutation disengages this block (byrne2020nek7conformationalflexibility pages 3-4).  
• NEK9 promotes back-to-back dimerization that is mutually exclusive with NLRP3 engagement, providing an allosteric switch between mitosis and inflammasome licensing (sharif2019structuralmechanismfor pages 4-6).  
• Ubiquitination has been suggested but specific sites remain undefined (byrne2020nek7conformationalflexibility pages 15-15).  

## Function  
NEK7 is expressed in heart, brain, liver, lung and spleen and localises to centrosomes throughout the cell cycle, relocating to the spindle midzone and midbody during late mitosis (liu2020nek7apotential pages 1-2, oregan2007mitoticregulationby pages 8-9).  
Mitotic roles include pericentriolar material recruitment, centriole duplication, bipolar spindle assembly, chromosome congression and cytokinesis; depletion causes spindle defects, lagging chromosomes and cytokinesis failure (bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 14-15, fry2017mitoticregulationby pages 1-2).  
Upstream regulation: CDK1 and PLK1 activate NEK9, which in turn phosphorylates and activates NEK7 (liu2020nek7apotential pages 1-2).  
Documented downstream substrates: EML4-Ser146 (chromosome congression), KIF11 (spindle organisation), TRF1-Ser114 (telomere protection) and RPS6KB1 (growth signalling) (bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 14-15, bachus2022inmitosisyou pages 15-17).  
Inflammasome licensing: NEK7 binds NLRP3 LRR/HD2 interfaces, releases NLRP3 autoinhibition and enables ASC speck formation; kinase activity is dispensable for this scaffolding role (shi2016nlrp3activationand pages 4-6, sharif2019structuralmechanismfor pages 1-2).  

## Inhibitors  
Compound 51 is the first ATP-competitive inhibitor co-crystallised with NEK7 and serves as a structural template for probe development (byrne2020nek7conformationalflexibility pages 1-2).  
JNK-IN-1 inhibits NEK7 by >80 % at 10 µM with limited cross-NEK activity (wells2018indepthanalysis pages 13-15).  
GSK-3 Inhibitor XIII reduces NEK7 activity to ~46 % at 1.25 µM via a substrate-competitive mode (moraes2015kinaseinhibitorprofile pages 12-15).  
Additional low-micromolar hits have been identified in broad kinase screens but lack potency and selectivity (unknownauthors2021probingthefunctions pages 41-45, byrne2020nek7conformationalflexibility pages 13-14).  

## Other Comments  
Elevated NEK7 expression is linked to retinoblastoma, gallbladder carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma (xu2016nek7anovel pages 1-1).  
Through control of NLRP3 activation, NEK7 contributes to inflammatory diseases such as gout, atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease (liu2020nek7apotential pages 1-2).  
A disease-linked R121H variant resides in the regulatory region and perturbs kinase regulation (bayliss2015theysand pages 20-25).
