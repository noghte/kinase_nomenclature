## Phylogeny
FAM20A belongs to the Fam20 family of atypical, metazoan-specific secretory pathway kinases (worby2021theabcsof pages 1-2, tagliabracci2013phosphorylationofsubstrates pages 2-3). Due to unique sequence features, the Fam20 family was not included in the original human kinome classification (worby2021theabcsof pages 1-2, sreelatha2015thesecretorypathway pages 1-2). The family includes the paralogs Fam20B and Fam20C (cui2017structureoffam20a pages 1-2). Fam20B is considered the ancestral kinase, from which FAM20A and FAM20C are thought to have arisen by gene duplication (tagliabracci2013phosphorylationofsubstrates pages 2-3, worby2021theabcsof pages 11-12). FAM20A is derived from Fam20C and first appeared in vertebrates; no orthologs have been identified in invertebrates or protochordates (worby2021theabcsof pages 11-12). Fam20 family proteins are conserved in humans, mice, and rats (filatova2015theroleof pages 17-20).



## Reaction Catalyzed
FAM20A is a pseudokinase and is catalytically inactive (cui2015asecretorykinase pages 11-13, cui2017structureoffam20a pages 1-2, filatova2015theroleof pages 20-24). It does not hydrolyze ATP effectively or phosphorylate protein substrates (cui2015asecretorykinase pages 2-4, cui2015asecretorykinase pages 11-13).



## Cofactor Requirements
FAM20A binds ATP in an inverted orientation independently of divalent cations (cui2017structureoffam20a pages 1-2). The substitution of residue Gln258 abolishes manganese binding (worby2021theabcsof pages 7-9).



## Substrate Specificity
FAM20A is a catalytically inactive pseudokinase and does not phosphorylate substrates (cui2015asecretorykinase pages 2-4).



## Structure
FAM20A has an N-terminal signal peptide for entry into the secretory pathway and a C-terminal kinase domain (tagliabracci2013phosphorylationofsubstrates pages 1-2, ishikawa2012therainesyndrome pages 2-3). It is classified as a pseudokinase because it lacks a critical negatively charged residue required for catalytic activity (cui2015asecretorykinase pages 11-13). Specifically, the glutamic acid in the αC helix that forms a key ion pair for kinase activation is replaced by glutamine (Gln258), disrupting this interaction (filatova2015theroleof pages 20-24, sreelatha2015thesecretorypathway pages 6-7). The conformation of its C-helix and activation loop motifs are distinct from canonical kinases, though precise architectural details remain unresolved (worby2021theabcsof pages 1-2, cui2015asecretorykinase pages 11-13). The canonical DFG motif is replaced by a D(N/H)(A/G) motif, and the absence of the phenylalanine residue disrupts the regulatory spine, indicating an inactive conformation (tagliabracci2013phosphorylationofsubstrates pages 2-3).

Crystal structures show that FAM20A forms a reversed face-to-face heterodimer with FAM20C, with an interaction interface of approximately 1000 Å² (zhang2018structureandevolution pages 1-2). Unique structural features include a highly conserved insertion within its Gly-rich loop, an atypical disulfide bond pattern, and an unprecedented inverted ATP-binding mode (cui2017structureoffam20a pages 1-2, cui2017structureoffam20a pages 13-14). The protein surface contains unique hydrophobic residues (Ile214A, Ile255A, and Leu365A) that optimize the interaction with FAM20C (xu2021fam20cinhuman pages 1-2).



## Regulation
N-glycosylation has been identified as a post-translational modification in FAM20A, which is essential for its entry into the secretory pathway, secretion, and stability (worby2021theabcsof pages 1-2). Fam20 kinases contain predicted N-linked glycosylation sites (tagliabracci2013phosphorylationofsubstrates pages 2-3).

The primary regulatory mechanism of FAM20A is allosteric (cui2015asecretorykinase pages 18-18). It functions as an allosteric activator of the kinase FAM20C upon forming a functional complex, which can be a heterodimer or a heterotetramer (cui2015asecretorykinase pages 11-13, zhang2018structureandevolution pages 1-2, filatova2015theroleof pages 20-24). ATP binding to FAM20A, while catalytically incompetent, is thought to stabilize a conformation necessary for this allosteric function (cui2015asecretorykinase pages 11-13).



## Function
FAM20A is expressed in a tissue-specific manner, with high expression in dental tissues (secretory-stage ameloblasts and odontoblasts), the lactating mammary gland, parathyroid gland, kidney, lung, and liver (cui2015asecretorykinase pages 11-13, filatova2015theroleof pages 20-24). Within cells, it is localized to the Golgi apparatus and partially to the endoplasmic reticulum (ishikawa2012therainesyndrome pages 2-3).

The primary function of FAM20A is to act as a regulatory partner for FAM20C (cui2015asecretorykinase pages 2-4). By forming a complex with FAM20C, FAM20A significantly increases FAM20C's kinase activity toward secreted substrates with SxE motifs (cui2015asecretorykinase pages 11-13). Substrates of the FAM20A/FAM20C complex include enamel matrix proteins such as enamelin (ENAM), amelogenin X (AMELX), ameloblastin (AMBN), and amelotin (AMTN), as well as proteins of the SIBLING family and FGF23 (cui2015asecretorykinase pages 2-4, sreelatha2015thesecretorypathway pages 14-17). This regulatory function is critical for biomineralization processes, including enamel formation and osteoblast mineralization (cui2015asecretorykinase pages 11-13, ohyama2016fam20abindsto pages 5-7). FAM20A also regulates the extracellular accumulation and secretion of FAM20C (ohyama2016fam20abindsto pages 1-2, ohyama2016fam20abindsto pages 5-7).



## Other Comments
Loss-of-function mutations in the FAM20A gene cause Amelogenesis Imperfecta (AI), a hereditary disorder characterized by defective enamel formation (cui2015asecretorykinase pages 11-13, cui2015asecretorykinase pages 2-4). This condition is often part of Enamel-Renal Syndrome (ERS), which can include nephrocalcinosis, gingival hyperplasia, intrapulpal calcifications, and delayed tooth eruption (cui2015asecretorykinase pages 18-18, filatova2015theroleof pages 20-24, cui2017structureoffam20a pages 13-14). These mutations impair the formation or function of the FAM20A/FAM20C complex, leading to inefficient phosphorylation of enamel matrix proteins by FAM20C (cui2015asecretorykinase pages 18-18, cui2015asecretorykinase pages 11-13).

Documented mutations include missense changes (e.g., G331D, D403N, L173R), frameshifts, deletions (e.g., F252del, Q241-R271 deletion), and nonsense mutations (e.g., R243X) that disrupt protein structure, stability, or complex formation (sreelatha2015thesecretorypathway pages 14-17, worby2021theabcsof pages 11-12). A Q258E mutant exhibits a reduced ability to activate FAM20C (cui2015asecretorykinase pages 11-13). Abnormal mRNA splicing leading to the truncation of FAM20A's unique insertion region also disrupts its function (cui2017structureoffam20a pages 1-2).
