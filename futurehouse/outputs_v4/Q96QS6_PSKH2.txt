## Phylogeny  
- Member of the Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent kinase (CAMK) group and classified within the PSKH sub-family (Manning2002)  
- Closest human paralog is the catalytically active PSKH1, sharing ~70 % kinase-domain identity (Shrestha2020)  
- Orthologs reported in chimpanzee, gorilla, dog, guinea pig, whale and platypus; gene absent in mouse and rat owing to rodent-specific loss (Caenepeel2004)  
- Early kinase catalogues placed PSKH2 in the CMGC/CLK cluster, reflecting historical annotation discrepancies (Hanks1995)  

## Reaction Catalyzed  
- ATP + protein-Ser/Thr → ADP + protein-O-phospho-Ser/Thr (Hanks1995)  
- Human PSKH2 carries an HRN catalytic-loop motif instead of HRD, removing the catalytic Asp required for phosphotransfer (Shrestha2020)  

## Cofactor Requirements  
- Structural motifs (β3 Lys92, αC Glu108, DFG Asp204) support a Mg²⁺-coordinated active site, but no biochemical cofactor data are available (Shrestha2020)  

## Substrate Specificity  
- No experimentally defined substrate motif; PSKH2 is absent from current kinase specificity atlases (Shrestha2020)  

## Structure  
- Single polypeptide comprising an N-terminal segment (~1–70) and a bilobed kinase domain (~71–350); no auxiliary domains (Shrestha2020)  
- AlphaFold model AF-Q96QS6-F1 predicts an active-like fold with intact Gly-rich loop (GXGXXS), β3 Lys92–αC Glu108 ion pair, HRN catalytic loop and DFG Asp204 (Shrestha2020)  
- Lacks the N-terminal Golgi-targeting sequence present in PSKH1; predicted myristoylation/palmitoylation sites remain unverified (Shrestha2020)  
- Contains Asp316 in the C-lobe where PSKH1 has a basic residue, highlighting a conserved surface alteration (Shrestha2020)  

## Regulation  
- No verified post-translational modifications have been reported (Shrestha2020)  
- Mass-spectrometry proximity analysis identified UNC119B as a PSKH2 interactor (Salcedo2023)  

## Function  
- Expression detected at transcript and protein level in public omics datasets; detailed tissue distribution not yet published (Shrestha2020)  
- Knowledge-graph and MS data associate PSKH2 with the Reactome “Cilium Assembly” pathway via UNC119B interaction (Salcedo2023)  

## Inhibitors  
None reported (Shrestha2020)  

## Other Comments  
- Absence of the gene in rodent models limits conventional in vivo functional studies (Caenepeel2004)
