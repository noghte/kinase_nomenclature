## Phylogeny
Inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 2 (IP6K2) is one of three mammalian isoforms (IP6K1, IP6K2, and IP6K3) belonging to the inositol hexakisphosphate kinase (IP6K) family within the larger inositol polyphosphate kinase superfamily (azevedo2011thesignalingrole pages 1-3, unknownauthors2019discoverysynthesisand pages 35-39, chakraborty2018theinositolpyrophosphate pages 36-37). IP6Ks are classified as atypical kinases, as they possess a unique domain architecture and substrate specificity that places them outside the canonical protein kinome classification established by Manning et al. (chakraborty2018theinositolpyrophosphate pages 39-44, unknownauthors2003functionalstudiesof pages 22-27, shears2019inositolphosphatekinases pages 1-3). The IP6K family is evolutionarily ancient, with orthologs found across eukaryotes, including yeast (*Kcs1*) and the early-diverged protist *Giardia lamblia*, suggesting the family arose from a primordial IP6K precursor (chakraborty2011inositolpyrophosphatesas pages 21-23, wang2014ip6kstructureand pages 1-2, azevedo2011thesignalingrole pages 1-3).



## Reaction Catalyzed
IP6K2 catalyzes the ATP-dependent transfer of the terminal phosphate from ATP to the 5-position of the inositol ring of inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6), yielding 5-diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate (5-IP7, also known as 5PP-InsP5 or InsP7) and ADP (chakraborty2011inositolpyrophosphatesas pages 21-23, wang2014ip6kstructureand pages 1-2, azevedo2011thesignalingrole pages 1-3). The enzyme can also phosphorylate inositol pentakisphosphate (IP5) to produce diphosphoinositol tetrakisphosphate (PP-IP4) and possesses a reverse, ATP synthase-like activity, transferring a phosphate from IP7 back to ADP to form ATP (unknownauthors2003functionalstudiesof pages 22-27, azevedo2011thesignalingrole pages 1-3). The kinase exhibits a high Km for ATP of approximately 1 mM (unknownauthors2019discoverysynthesisand pages 43-48).



## Cofactor Requirements
The catalytic activity of IP6K2 requires divalent metal ions, specifically Mg2+, as a cofactor (chakraborty2011inositolpyrophosphatesas pages 21-23, chakraborty2018theinositolpyrophosphate pages 39-44, minini2020thekeyrole pages 10-12).



## Substrate Specificity
The primary substrate for IP6K2 is inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6) (chakraborty2011inositolpyrophosphatesas pages 21-23, chakraborty2018theinositolpyrophosphate pages 36-37). It shows a 20-fold higher affinity for InsP6 compared to inositol pentakisphosphate (InsP5) (minini2020thekeyrole pages 3-5). IP6K2 also retains vestigial kinase activity toward inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3), which it phosphorylates at the 6-OH position (wang2014ip6kstructureand pages 1-2). In addition to inositol phosphates, protein 4.1N has been identified as a protein substrate (unknownauthors2019discoverysynthesisand pages 35-39). The context provided does not contain information on consensus substrate motifs.



## Structure
IP6K2 belongs to the ATP-grasp fold kinase family (chakraborty2018theinositolpyrophosphate pages 36-37). The structure consists of a variable N-terminal region and a highly conserved C-terminal catalytic region (unknownauthors2003functionalstudiesof pages 22-27, barker2009inositolpyrophosphatesstructure pages 5-7). Structural modeling using AlphaFold (for UniProt Q9UHH9) reveals the organization of the N-terminus and a conserved catalytic domain, which contains isoform-specific regions that mediate selective protein interactions (chakraborty2018theinositolpyrophosphate pages 39-44). The catalytic domain contains a conserved PxxxDxKxG motif for inositol phosphate binding and an essential SSLL tetrapeptide motif required for kinase activity (minini2020thekeyrole pages 3-5, unknownauthors2019discoverysynthesisand pages 23-27, wang2014ip6kstructureand pages 1-2). IP6K2 is predominantly nuclear, a localization facilitated by a bipartite nuclear localization signal (barker2009inositolpyrophosphatesstructure pages 5-7).



## Regulation
IP6K2 activity and stability are regulated by post-translational modifications and protein interactions. Phosphorylation by casein kinase 2 (CK2) targets IP6K2 for proteasomal degradation, thereby reducing its stability and pro-apoptotic function (chakraborty2011inositolpyrophosphatesas pages 21-23, chakraborty2018theinositolpyrophosphate pages 39-44, unknownauthors2019discoverysynthesisand pages 35-39). While protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) regulate the IP6K1 isoform, their regulation of IP6K2 is not described or is considered less relevant (chakraborty2018theinositolpyrophosphate pages 39-44). Similarly, direct phosphorylation of IP6K2 by mTOR is not detailed in the provided context (chakraborty2018theinositolpyrophosphate pages 39-44). IP6K2 is a client protein of the molecular chaperone HSP90; the binding of HSP90 inhibits its catalytic activity (chakraborty2011inositolpyrophosphatesas pages 21-23, chakraborty2018theinositolpyrophosphate pages 17-19). Apoptotic stimuli stabilize and activate IP6K2 and promote its translocation into the nucleus (chakraborty2011inositolpyrophosphatesas pages 21-23).



## Function
IP6K2 is expressed in various mammalian tissues, including high levels in the brain (cerebellar granule and Purkinje cells), testis, breast, thymus, colon, adipose tissue, and prostate (chakraborty2018theinositolpyrophosphate pages 17-19, unknownauthors2019discoverysynthesisand pages 35-39, minini2020thekeyrole pages 3-5, unknownauthors2022theinositolpyrophosphates pages 23-28).

IP6K2 interacts with the tumor suppressor p53 in the nucleus, augmenting its apoptotic function (chakraborty2011inositolpyrophosphatesas pages 21-23, chakraborty2018theinositolpyrophosphate pages 17-19). Other interacting partners include TNF receptor-associated factor-2 (TRAF2), protein 4.1N, the kinase LKB1, and creatine kinase-B (chakraborty2018theinositolpyrophosphate pages 39-44, unknownauthors2019discoverysynthesisand pages 35-39, minini2020thekeyrole pages 10-12, unknownauthors2022theinositolpyrophosphates pages 23-28). The product of IP6K2 activity, 5-IP7, can activate protein kinase CK2 (minini2020thekeyrole pages 3-5).

IP6K2 plays a primary role in promoting apoptosis and is involved in DNA repair pathways, where it can stabilize DNA-PKcs and ATM (chakraborty2011inositolpyrophosphatesas pages 21-23, wang2014ip6kstructureand pages 1-2, unknownauthors2022theinositolpyrophosphates pages 23-28). Overexpression of IP6K2 enhances apoptosis induced by stimuli like γ-irradiation and cisplatin (minini2020thekeyrole pages 10-12, chakraborty2018theinositolpyrophosphate pages 17-19). It is also essential for neuronal migration and synapse formation in the brain (unknownauthors2019discoverysynthesisand pages 35-39). Additional functions include regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) via interaction with LKB1, vesicle trafficking, autophagy, and cellular energy dynamics (minini2020thekeyrole pages 10-12, chakraborty2011inositolpyrophosphatesas pages 21-23, unknownauthors2003functionalstudiesof pages 22-27, unknownauthors2022theinositolpyrophosphates pages 23-28).



## Inhibitors
The ATP-competitive molecule N2-(m-trifluorobenzyl)-N6-(p-nitrobenzyl)purine (TNP) is a known pan-IP6K inhibitor that also targets IP6K2, although it has off-target effects (minini2020thekeyrole pages 10-12, unknownauthors2019discoverysynthesisand pages 43-48). Other non-selective inhibitors that target IP6K1 and may also affect IP6K2 include phenylarsine oxide (PAO), U73122, and LY294002 (unknownauthors2019discoverysynthesisand pages 23-27).



## Other Comments
IP6K2 has an alternative name, PiUS (P(i)-uptake stimulator) (unknownauthors2003functionalstudiesof pages 22-27). The protein has a dual, context-dependent role in cancer. Deletion of IP6K2 increases susceptibility to carcinogen-induced tumors, yet it can also promote metastasis by enabling invasive phenotypes (minini2020thekeyrole pages 10-12, wang2014ip6kstructureand pages 1-2). IP6K2 is also implicated in the pathogenesis of Huntington’s disease through increased production of 5PP-IP5 (unknownauthors2019discoverysynthesisand pages 23-27). IP6K2 knockout mice show improved survival after ionizing radiation, highlighting the protein's pro-apoptotic role in response to DNA damage (chakraborty2018theinositolpyrophosphate pages 17-19).
