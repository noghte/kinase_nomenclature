## Phylogeny  
• Kinome placement: CMGC group → RCK (ros-cross-hybridizing kinase) subfamily together with MAK and ICK/MRK (chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 12-13).  
• Paralogous relationships: 42.6 % identity to MRK/ICK and 40.5 % to MAK (miyata1999molecularcloningand pages 2-3).  
• Activation-segment divergence: MOK carries a TEY motif whereas MAK/ICK harbour TDY, marking a distinct clade within RCK kinases (miyata1999molecularcloningand pages 2-3).  
• Orthologs: DYF-5 (Caenorhabditis elegans), LF4 (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii), LF4A (Tetrahymena thermophila), LmxMPK9 (Leishmania mexicana) – all conserved negative regulators of axonemal length (fu2019ciliogenesisassociatedkinase pages 8-9, fu2019ciliogenesisassociatedkinase pages 9-10).  

## Reaction Catalyzed  
ATP + [protein]-Ser/Thr → ADP + [protein]-Ser/Thr-P  
(intrinsic autophosphorylation on the TEY activation loop is also observed) (miyata1999molecularcloningand pages 1-2).  

## Cofactor Requirements  
No experimental study has defined divalent-metal dependence; cofactor requirement remains unreported (chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 12-13).  

## Substrate Specificity  
• Consensus motif: R-P-X-S/T-P derived from positional-scanning peptide arrays applied to RCK kinases and enriched among MOK interactors (unknownauthors2012ciliarylengthcontrol pages 62-65).  
• Validated cellular substrates  
  – Brd4 Ser492, controlling microglial inflammatory/type-I IFN gene expression (perezcabello2023mapkmakmrkoverlappingkinase pages 1-2).  
  – Raptor, linking MOK to mTORC1 signalling (unknownauthors2012ciliarylengthcontrol pages 49-52).  
• The kinase efficiently phosphorylates generic MAPK reporter peptides and undergoes robust autophosphorylation when the TEY motif is intact (miyata1999molecularcloningand pages 1-2).  

## Structure  
• Length 419–420 aa; single catalytic domain. Non-canonical glycine-rich loop GXGXXS replaces the canonical GXGXXG (miyata1999molecularcloningand pages 2-3).  
• Catalytic core adopts the bilobal MAPK fold according to AlphaFold model AF-Q9UQ07-F1; key elements: Lys41–Glu59 salt bridge, HRD (His153-Arg154-Asp155) catalytic triad, DFG motif at residues 175-177, correctly aligned hydrophobic spine, and outward-rotated C-helix in the inactive prediction (perezcabello2023mapkmakmrkoverlappingkinase pages 1-2).  
• Activation segment: TEY183-185; dual phosphorylation is obligatory for activity (miyata1999molecularcloningand pages 6-7).  
• No experimentally determined PDB structure is available to date (chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 12-13).  

## Regulation  
Post-translational modifications  
• Thr183/Tyr185 dual phosphorylation activates the kinase; TEY→AEA mutation ablates activity (miyata1999molecularcloningand pages 6-7).  
• Upstream activating kinase has not been identified (chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 12-13).  
• MOK performs tyrosine autophosphorylation on Tyr185 in vitro (miyata1999molecularcloningand pages 1-2).  
Signal-dependent control  
• Rapid activation by phorbol ester (TPA); no response to serum, anisomycin or hyperosmotic stress (miyata1999molecularcloningand pages 6-7).  
• Okadaic acid markedly augments activity, implicating serine/threonine phosphatases as negative regulators (miyata1999molecularcloningand pages 6-7).  
Protein interactions  
• Binds HSP90 and the co-chaperone Cdc37, indicating chaperone-assisted maturation/stability (unknownauthors2012ciliarylengthcontrol pages 70-72).  

## Function  
Expression  
• Broad mRNA expression in human heart, brain, lung, kidney and pancreas; highest in mouse testis (miyata1999molecularcloningand pages 2-3).  
• Present throughout the small intestine but low in colon epithelium (unknownauthors2018thelongand pages 96-100).  
• Endogenous protein detected in renal epithelial IMCD-3 cells (unknownauthors2012ciliarylengthcontrol pages 45-49).  
• Up-regulated in spinal-cord microglia from ALS patients and SOD1G93A mice (perezcabello2023mapkmakmrkoverlappingkinase pages 1-2).  
Subcellular localisation and roles  
• Localises along the axoneme and at the basal body of primary cilia; shRNA knock-down produces ~40 % ciliary elongation, defining MOK as a negative regulator of cilium length (unknownauthors2012ciliarylengthcontrol pages 38-45).  
• Modulates intraflagellar transport frequency without altering motor velocity (jansen2012regulationofcilium pages 1-1).  
Signalling interactions  
• Phosphorylates Raptor, attenuating mTORC1; rapamycin blocks the ciliary-elongation phenotype of MOK loss (unknownauthors2012ciliarylengthcontrol pages 49-52).  
• Phosphorylates Brd4 to enhance chromatin binding at cytokine promoters and drive TNF-α/IL-6/IL-1β induction in LPS-stimulated microglia (perezcabello2023mapkmakmrkoverlappingkinase pages 1-2).  
• Co-localises with cytoplasmic TDP-43 inclusions in ALS models (perezcabello2023mapkmakmrkoverlappingkinase pages 1-2).  
• Proteomic pull-downs identify centrosomal/ciliary partners such as centriolin, CEP350 and rootletin, consistent with roles in microtubule anchoring (unknownauthors2012ciliarylengthcontrol pages 62-65).  

## Inhibitors  
• C13: research-grade small molecule that inhibits MOK-dependent Brd4 Ser492 phosphorylation and suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in microglia (perezcabello2023mapkmakmrkoverlappingkinase pages 1-2).  

## Other Comments  
• MOK protein is markedly down-regulated in mouse intestinal adenomas, suggesting loss may accompany intestinal tumorigenesis (chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 12-13, unknownauthors2018thelongand pages 96-100).  
• Elevated expression in ALS microglia and functional mitigation by C13 nominate MOK as a potential neuroinflammatory target (perezcabello2023mapkmakmrkoverlappingkinase pages 1-2).
