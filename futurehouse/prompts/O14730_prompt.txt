# Information

**Protein Name: Serine/threonine-protein kinase RIO3 / gene: RIOK3 SUDD**
**Uniprot Id: O14730**
**Protein alternative names: RIO kinase 3; sudD homolog**
**Protein Function: Involved in regulation of type I interferon (IFN)-dependent immune response which plays a critical role in the innate immune response against DNA and RNA viruses. May act as an adapter protein essential for the recruitment of TBK1 to IRF3 (PubMed:24807708). Phosphorylates IFIH1 on 'Ser-828' interfering with IFIH1 filament assembly on long dsRNA and resulting in attenuated IFIH1-signaling (PubMed:25865883). Can inhibit CASP10 isoform 7-mediated activation of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway (PubMed:19557502). May play a role in the biogenesis of the 40S ribosomal subunit. Involved in the processing of 21S pre-rRNA to the mature 18S rRNA (PubMed:22418843)**

Develop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting. The output should mirror the organization and style of the template, without introducing new sections such as "Summary" or "Conclusion".
Also, do not interpret results. For example **DO NOT** add sentences to interpret the findings (such as **suggesting that**, etc.)
ONLY consider publications and ignore clinical trials/patents/opentargets.
Prioritize articles with a higher number of citations and prioritize domain leading or highest impact journals.

This template provides an example of expected **section headers, structure and writing tone**. Use it solely to guide the format. You are encouraged to improve the depth and comprehensiveness of your response without being repetitive and speculative.
