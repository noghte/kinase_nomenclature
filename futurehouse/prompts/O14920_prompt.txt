# Information

**Protein Name: Inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit beta / gene: IKBKB (IKKβ) IKKB**
**Uniprot Id: O14920**
**Protein alternative names: I-kappa-B kinase 2; Nuclear factor NF-kappa-B inhibitor kinase beta; Serine/threonine protein kinase IKBKB**
**Protein Function: Serine kinase that plays an essential role in the NF-kappa-B signaling pathway which is activated by multiple stimuli such as inflammatory cytokines, bacterial or viral products, DNA damages or other cellular stresses (PubMed:20434986, PubMed:20797629, PubMed:21138416, PubMed:30337470, PubMed:9346484). Acts as a part of the canonical IKK complex in the conventional pathway of NF-kappa-B activation (PubMed:9346484). Phosphorylates inhibitors of NF-kappa-B on 2 critical serine residues (PubMed:20434986, PubMed:20797629, PubMed:21138416, PubMed:9346484). These modifications allow polyubiquitination of the inhibitors and subsequent degradation by the proteasome (PubMed:20434986, PubMed:20797629, PubMed:21138416, PubMed:9346484). In turn, free NF-kappa-B is translocated into the nucleus and activates the transcription of hundreds of genes involved in immune response, growth control, or protection against apoptosis (PubMed:20434986, PubMed:20797629, PubMed:21138416, PubMed:9346484).

Develop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting. The output should mirror the organization and style of the template, without introducing new sections such as "Summary" or "Conclusion".
Also, do not interpret results. For example **DO NOT** add sentences to interpret the findings (such as **suggesting that**, etc.)
ONLY consider publications and ignore clinical trials/patents/opentargets.
Prioritize articles with a higher number of citations and prioritize domain leading or highest impact journals.

This template provides an example of expected **section headers, structure and writing tone**. Use it solely to guide the format. You are encouraged to improve the depth and comprehensiveness of your response without being repetitive and speculative.
