# Information

**Protein Name: Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase type-1 gamma / gene: PIP5K1C KIAA0589**
**Uniprot Id: O60331**
**Protein alternative names: Type I phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase gamma**
**Protein Function: Catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P/PI4P) to form phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2/PIP2), a lipid second messenger that regulates several cellular processes such as signal transduction, vesicle trafficking, actin cytoskeleton dynamics, cell adhesion, and cell motility (PubMed:12422219, PubMed:22942276). PtdIns(4,5)P2 can directly act as a second messenger or can be utilized as a precursor to generate other second messengers: inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), diacylglycerol (DAG) or phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3/PIP3) (Probable). PIP5K1A-mediated phosphorylation of PtdIns(4)P is the predominant pathway for PtdIns(4,5)P2 synthesis (By similarity). Together with PIP5K1A, is required for phagocytosis, both enzymes regulating different types of actin remodeling at sequential steps (By similarity). Promotes particle attachment by generating the pool of PtdIns(4,5)P2 that induces controlled actin depol**

Develop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting. The output should mirror the organization and style of the template, without introducing new sections such as "Summary" or "Conclusion".
Also, do not interpret results. For example **DO NOT** add sentences to interpret the findings (such as **suggesting that**, etc.)
ONLY consider publications and ignore clinical trials/patents/opentargets.
Prioritize articles with a higher number of citations and prioritize domain leading or highest impact journals.

This template provides an example of expected **section headers, structure and writing tone**. Use it solely to guide the format. You are encouraged to improve the depth and comprehensiveness of your response without being repetitive and speculative.
