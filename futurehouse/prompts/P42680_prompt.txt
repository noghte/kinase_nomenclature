# Information

**Protein Name: Tyrosine-protein kinase Tec / gene: TEC PSCTK4**
**Uniprot Id: P42680**
**Protein alternative names: **
**Protein Function: Non-receptor tyrosine kinase that contributes to signaling from many receptors and participates as a signal transducer in multiple downstream pathways, including regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Plays a redundant role to ITK in regulation of the adaptive immune response. Regulates the development, function and differentiation of conventional T-cells and nonconventional NKT-cells. Required for TCR-dependent IL2 gene induction. Phosphorylates DOK1, one CD28-specific substrate, and contributes to CD28-signaling. Mediates signals that negatively regulate IL2RA expression induced by TCR cross-linking. Plays a redundant role to BTK in BCR-signaling for B-cell development and activation, especially by phosphorylating STAP1, a BCR-signaling protein. Required in mast cells for efficient cytokine production. Involved in both growth and differentiation mechanisms of myeloid cells through activation by the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor CSF3, a critical cytokine to promoting the growth**

Develop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting. The output should mirror the organization and style of the template, without introducing new sections such as "Summary" or "Conclusion".
Also, do not interpret results. For example **DO NOT** add sentences to interpret the findings (such as **suggesting that**, etc.)
ONLY consider publications and ignore clinical trials/patents/opentargets.
Prioritize articles with a higher number of citations and prioritize domain leading or highest impact journals.

This template provides an example of expected **section headers, structure and writing tone**. Use it solely to guide the format. You are encouraged to improve the depth and comprehensiveness of your response without being repetitive and speculative.
