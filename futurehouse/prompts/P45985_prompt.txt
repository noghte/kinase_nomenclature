# Information

**Protein Name: Dual specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 / gene: MAP2K4 (SEK1) JNKK1; MEK4; MKK4; PRKMK4; SEK1; SERK1; SKK1**
**Uniprot Id: P45985**
**Protein alternative names: JNK-activating kinase 1; MAPK/ERK kinase 4; SAPK/ERK kinase 1; Stress-activated protein kinase kinase 1; c-Jun N-terminal kinase kinase 1**
**Protein Function: Dual specificity protein kinase which acts as an essential component of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. Essential component of the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAP/JNK) signaling pathway. With MAP2K7/MKK7, is the one of the only known kinase to directly activate the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinases MAPK8/JNK1, MAPK9/JNK2 and MAPK10/JNK3. MAP2K4/MKK4 and MAP2K7/MKK7 both activate the JNKs by phosphorylation, but they differ in their preference for the phosphorylation site in the Thr-Pro-Tyr motif. MAP2K4 shows preference for phosphorylation of the Tyr residue and MAP2K7/MKK7 for the Thr residue. The phosphorylation of the Thr residue by MAP2K7/MKK7 seems to be the prerequisite for JNK activation at least in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines, while other stimuli activate both MAP2K4/MKK4 and MAP2K7/MKK7 which synergistically phosphorylate JNKs. MAP2K4 is required for maintaining peripheral lymphoid homeostasis. The MKK/**

Develop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting. The output should mirror the organization and style of the template, without introducing new sections such as "Summary" or "Conclusion".
Also, do not interpret results. For example **DO NOT** add sentences to interpret the findings (such as **suggesting that**, etc.)
ONLY consider publications and ignore clinical trials/patents/opentargets.
Prioritize articles with a higher number of citations and prioritize domain leading or highest impact journals.

This template provides an example of expected **section headers, structure and writing tone**. Use it solely to guide the format. You are encouraged to improve the depth and comprehensiveness of your response without being repetitive and speculative.
