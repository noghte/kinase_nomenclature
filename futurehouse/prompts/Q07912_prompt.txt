# Information

**Protein Name: Activated CDC42 kinase 1 / gene: TNK2 (Ack) ACK1**
**Uniprot Id: Q07912**
**Protein alternative names: Tyrosine kinase non-receptor protein 2**
**Protein Function: Non-receptor tyrosine-protein and serine/threonine-protein kinase that is implicated in cell spreading and migration, cell survival, cell growth and proliferation. Transduces extracellular signals to cytosolic and nuclear effectors. Phosphorylates AKT1, AR, MCF2, WASL and WWOX. Implicated in trafficking and clathrin-mediated endocytosis through binding to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and clathrin. Binds to both poly- and mono-ubiquitin and regulates ligand-induced degradation of EGFR, thereby contributing to the accumulation of EGFR at the limiting membrane of early endosomes. Downstream effector of CDC42 which mediates CDC42-dependent cell migration via phosphorylation of BCAR1. May be involved both in adult synaptic function and plasticity and in brain development. Activates AKT1 by phosphorylating it on 'Tyr-176'. Phosphorylates AR on 'Tyr-267' and 'Tyr-363' thereby promoting its recruitment to androgen-responsive enhancers (AREs). Phosphorylates WWOX on 'Tyr-287'. Phosph**

Develop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting. The output should mirror the organization and style of the template, without introducing new sections such as "Summary" or "Conclusion".
Also, do not interpret results. For example **DO NOT** add sentences to interpret the findings (such as **suggesting that**, etc.)
ONLY consider publications and ignore clinical trials/patents/opentargets.
Prioritize articles with a higher number of citations and prioritize domain leading or highest impact journals.

This template provides an example of expected **section headers, structure and writing tone**. Use it solely to guide the format. You are encouraged to improve the depth and comprehensiveness of your response without being repetitive and speculative.
