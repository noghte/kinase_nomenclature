# Information

**Protein Name: Serine/threonine-protein kinase PAK 1 / gene: PAK1 **
**Uniprot Id: Q13153**
**Protein alternative names: Alpha-PAK; p21-activated kinase 1; p65-PAK**
**Protein Function: Protein kinase involved in intracellular signaling pathways downstream of integrins and receptor-type kinases that plays an important role in cytoskeleton dynamics, in cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, apoptosis, mitosis, and in vesicle-mediated transport processes (PubMed:10551809, PubMed:11896197, PubMed:12876277, PubMed:14585966, PubMed:15611088, PubMed:17726028, PubMed:17989089, PubMed:30290153, PubMed:17420447). Can directly phosphorylate BAD and protects cells against apoptosis (By similarity). Activated by interaction with CDC42 and RAC1 (PubMed:8805275, PubMed:9528787). Functions as a GTPase effector that links the Rho-related GTPases CDC42 and RAC1 to the JNK MAP kinase pathway (PubMed:8805275, PubMed:9528787). Phosphorylates and activates MAP2K1, and thereby mediates activation of downstream MAP kinases (By similarity). Involved in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, actin stress fibers and of focal adhesion complexes (PubMed:9032240, PubMed:9395435). Phospho**

Develop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting. The output should mirror the organization and style of the template, without introducing new sections such as "Summary" or "Conclusion".
Also, do not interpret results. For example **DO NOT** add sentences to interpret the findings (such as **suggesting that**, etc.)
ONLY consider publications and ignore clinical trials/patents/opentargets.
Prioritize articles with a higher number of citations and prioritize domain leading or highest impact journals.

This template provides an example of expected **section headers, structure and writing tone**. Use it solely to guide the format. You are encouraged to improve the depth and comprehensiveness of your response without being repetitive and speculative.
