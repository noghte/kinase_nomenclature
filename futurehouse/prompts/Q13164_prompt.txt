# Information

**Protein Name: Mitogen-activated protein kinase 7 / gene: MAPK7 (Erk5) BMK1; ERK5; PRKM7**
**Uniprot Id: Q13164**
**Protein alternative names: Big MAP kinase 1; Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5**
**Protein Function: Plays a role in various cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation and cell survival. The upstream activator of MAPK7 is the MAPK kinase MAP2K5. Upon activation, it translocates to the nucleus and phosphorylates various downstream targets including MEF2C. EGF activates MAPK7 through a Ras-independent and MAP2K5-dependent pathway. As part of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, acts as a negative regulator of apoptosis in cardiomyocytes via interaction with STUB1/CHIP and promotion of STUB1-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of ICER-type isoforms of CREM (By similarity). May have a role in muscle cell differentiation. May be important for endothelial function and maintenance of blood vessel integrity. MAP2K5 and MAPK7 interact specifically with one another and not with MEK1/ERK1 or MEK2/ERK2 pathways. Phosphorylates SGK1 at Ser-78 and this is required for growth factor-induced cell cycle progression. Involved in the regulation of p53/TP53 by disrupting the PML-MDM2 intera**

Develop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting. The output should mirror the organization and style of the template, without introducing new sections such as "Summary" or "Conclusion".
Also, do not interpret results. For example **DO NOT** add sentences to interpret the findings (such as **suggesting that**, etc.)
ONLY consider publications and ignore clinical trials/patents/opentargets.
Prioritize articles with a higher number of citations and prioritize domain leading or highest impact journals.

This template provides an example of expected **section headers, structure and writing tone**. Use it solely to guide the format. You are encouraged to improve the depth and comprehensiveness of your response without being repetitive and speculative.
