# Information

**Protein Name: cGMP-dependent protein kinase 1 / gene: PRKG1 (PKG1) PRKG1B; PRKGR1A; PRKGR1B**
**Uniprot Id: Q13976**
**Protein alternative names: cGMP-dependent protein kinase I**
**Protein Function: Serine/threonine protein kinase that acts as a key mediator of the nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP signaling pathway. GMP binding activates PRKG1, which phosphorylates serines and threonines on many cellular proteins. Numerous protein targets for PRKG1 phosphorylation are implicated in modulating cellular calcium, but the contribution of each of these targets may vary substantially among cell types. Proteins that are phosphorylated by PRKG1 regulate platelet activation and adhesion, smooth muscle contraction, cardiac function, gene expression, feedback of the NO-signaling pathway, and other processes involved in several aspects of the CNS like axon guidance, hippocampal and cerebellar learning, circadian rhythm and nociception. Smooth muscle relaxation is mediated through lowering of intracellular free calcium, by desensitization of contractile proteins to calcium, and by decrease in the contractile state of smooth muscle or in platelet activation. Regulates intracellular calcium levels via sev**

Develop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting. The output should mirror the organization and style of the template, without introducing new sections such as "Summary" or "Conclusion".
Also, do not interpret results. For example **DO NOT** add sentences to interpret the findings (such as **suggesting that**, etc.)
ONLY consider publications and ignore clinical trials/patents/opentargets.
Prioritize articles with a higher number of citations and prioritize domain leading or highest impact journals.

This template provides an example of expected **section headers, structure and writing tone**. Use it solely to guide the format. You are encouraged to improve the depth and comprehensiveness of your response without being repetitive and speculative.
