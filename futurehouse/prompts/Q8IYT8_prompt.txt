# Information

**Protein Name: Serine/threonine-protein kinase ULK2 / gene: ULK2 KIAA0623**
**Uniprot Id: Q8IYT8**
**Protein alternative names: Unc-51-like kinase 2**
**Protein Function: Serine/threonine-protein kinase involved in autophagy in response to starvation. Acts upstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase PIK3C3 to regulate the formation of autophagophores, the precursors of autophagosomes. Part of regulatory feedback loops in autophagy: acts both as a downstream effector and a negative regulator of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) via interaction with RPTOR. Activated via phosphorylation by AMPK, also acts as a negative regulator of AMPK through phosphorylation of the AMPK subunits PRKAA1, PRKAB2 and PRKAG1. May phosphorylate ATG13/KIAA0652, FRS2, FRS3 and RPTOR; however such data need additional evidences. Not involved in ammonia-induced autophagy or in autophagic response of cerebellar granule neurons (CGN) to low potassium concentration. Plays a role early in neuronal differentiation and is required for granule cell axon formation: may govern axon formation via Ras-like GTPase signaling and through regulation of the Rab5-mediated endocytic p**

Develop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting. The output should mirror the organization and style of the template, without introducing new sections such as "Summary" or "Conclusion".
Also, do not interpret results. For example **DO NOT** add sentences to interpret the findings (such as **suggesting that**, etc.)
ONLY consider publications and ignore clinical trials/patents/opentargets.
Prioritize articles with a higher number of citations and prioritize domain leading or highest impact journals.

This template provides an example of expected **section headers, structure and writing tone**. Use it solely to guide the format. You are encouraged to improve the depth and comprehensiveness of your response without being repetitive and speculative.
