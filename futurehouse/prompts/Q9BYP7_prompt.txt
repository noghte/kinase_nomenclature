# Information

**Protein Name: Serine/threonine-protein kinase WNK3 / gene: WNK3 KIAA1566; PRKWNK3**
**Uniprot Id: Q9BYP7**
**Protein alternative names: Protein kinase lysine-deficient 3; Protein kinase with no lysine 3**
**Protein Function: Serine/threonine-protein kinase component of the WNK3-SPAK/OSR1 kinase cascade, which plays an important role in the regulation of electrolyte homeostasis and regulatory volume increase in response to hyperosmotic stress (PubMed:16275911, PubMed:16275913, PubMed:16501604, PubMed:22989884, PubMed:36318922). WNK3 mediates regulatory volume increase in response to hyperosmotic stress by acting as a molecular crowding sensor, which senses cell shrinkage and mediates formation of a membraneless compartment by undergoing liquid-liquid phase separation (PubMed:36318922). The membraneless compartment concentrates WNK3 with its substrates, OXSR1/OSR1 and STK39/SPAK, promoting WNK3-dependent phosphorylation and activation of downstream kinases OXSR1/OSR1 and STK39/SPAK (PubMed:22989884). Following activation, OXSR1/OSR1 and STK39/SPAK catalyze phosphorylation of ion cotransporters SLC12A1/NKCC2, SLC12A2/NKCC1, SLC12A3/NCC, SLC12A4/KCC1, SLC12A5/KCC2 or SLC12A6/KCC3, regulating their activity (Pu**

Develop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting. The output should mirror the organization and style of the template, without introducing new sections such as "Summary" or "Conclusion".
Also, do not interpret results. For example **DO NOT** add sentences to interpret the findings (such as **suggesting that**, etc.)
ONLY consider publications and ignore clinical trials/patents/opentargets.
Prioritize articles with a higher number of citations and prioritize domain leading or highest impact journals.

This template provides an example of expected **section headers, structure and writing tone**. Use it solely to guide the format. You are encouraged to improve the depth and comprehensiveness of your response without being repetitive and speculative.
