# Information

**Protein Name: Serine/threonine-protein kinase PLK3 / gene: PLK3 CNK; FNK; PRK**
**Uniprot Id: Q9H4B4**
**Protein alternative names: Cytokine-inducible serine/threonine-protein kinase; FGF-inducible kinase; Polo-like kinase 3; Proliferation-related kinase**
**Protein Function: Serine/threonine-protein kinase involved in cell cycle regulation, response to stress and Golgi disassembly. Polo-like kinases act by binding and phosphorylating proteins that are already phosphorylated on a specific motif recognized by the POLO box domains. Phosphorylates ATF2, BCL2L1, CDC25A, CDC25C, CHEK2, HIF1A, JUN, p53/TP53, p73/TP73, PTEN, TOP2A and VRK1. Involved in cell cycle regulation: required for entry into S phase and cytokinesis. Phosphorylates BCL2L1, leading to regulate the G2 checkpoint and progression to cytokinesis during mitosis. Plays a key role in response to stress: rapidly activated upon stress stimulation, such as ionizing radiation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), hyperosmotic stress, UV irradiation and hypoxia. Involved in DNA damage response and G1/S transition checkpoint by phosphorylating CDC25A, p53/TP53 and p73/TP73. Phosphorylates p53/TP53 in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby promoting p53/TP53-mediated apoptosis. Phosphorylates CHEK2 i**

Develop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting. The output should mirror the organization and style of the template, without introducing new sections such as "Summary" or "Conclusion".
Also, do not interpret results. For example **DO NOT** add sentences to interpret the findings (such as **suggesting that**, etc.)
ONLY consider publications and ignore clinical trials/patents/opentargets.
Prioritize articles with a higher number of citations and prioritize domain leading or highest impact journals.

This template provides an example of expected **section headers, structure and writing tone**. Use it solely to guide the format. You are encouraged to improve the depth and comprehensiveness of your response without being repetitive and speculative.
