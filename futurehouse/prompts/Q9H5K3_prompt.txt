# Information

**Protein Name: Protein O-mannose kinase / gene: POMK (SgK196) SGK196**
**Uniprot Id: Q9H5K3**
**Protein alternative names: Protein kinase-like protein SgK196; Sugen kinase 196**
**Protein Function: Protein O-mannose kinase that specifically mediates phosphorylation at the 6-position of an O-mannose of the trisaccharide (N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)-beta-1,4-mannose) to generate phosphorylated O-mannosyl trisaccharide (N-acetylgalactosamine-beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosamine-beta-1,4-(phosphate-6-)mannose). Phosphorylated O-mannosyl trisaccharide is a carbohydrate structure present in alpha-dystroglycan (DAG1), which is required for binding laminin G-like domain-containing extracellular proteins with high affinity. Only shows kinase activity when the GalNAc-beta-3-GlcNAc-beta-terminus is linked to the 4-position of O-mannose, suggesting that this disaccharide serves as the substrate recognition motif**

Develop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting. The output should mirror the organization and style of the template, without introducing new sections such as "Summary" or "Conclusion".
Also, do not interpret results. For example **DO NOT** add sentences to interpret the findings (such as **suggesting that**, etc.)
ONLY consider publications and ignore clinical trials/patents/opentargets.
Prioritize articles with a higher number of citations and prioritize domain leading or highest impact journals.

This template provides an example of expected **section headers, structure and writing tone**. Use it solely to guide the format. You are encouraged to improve the depth and comprehensiveness of your response without being repetitive and speculative.
