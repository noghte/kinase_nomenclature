# Information

**Protein Name: Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 20 / gene: MAP3K20 (ZAK) MLK7; MLTK; ZAK**
**Uniprot Id: Q9NYL2**
**Protein alternative names: Human cervical cancer suppressor gene 4 protein; Leucine zipper- and sterile alpha motif-containing kinase; MLK-like mitogen-activated protein triple kinase; Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase MLT; Mixed lineage kinase 7; Mixed lineage kinase-related kinase; Sterile alpha motif- and leucine zipper-containing kinase AZK**
**Protein Function: Stress-activated component of a protein kinase signal transduction cascade that promotes programmed cell death in response to various stress, such as ribosomal stress, osmotic shock and ionizing radiation (PubMed:10924358, PubMed:11836244, PubMed:12220515, PubMed:14521931, PubMed:15350844, PubMed:15737997, PubMed:18331592, PubMed:20559024, PubMed:26999302, PubMed:32289254, PubMed:32610081, PubMed:35857590). Acts by catalyzing phosphorylation of MAP kinase kinases, leading to activation of the JNK (MAPK8/JNK1, MAPK9/JNK2 and/or MAPK10/JNK3) and MAP kinase p38 (MAPK11, MAPK12, MAPK13 and/or MAPK14) pathways (PubMed:11042189, PubMed:11836244, PubMed:12220515, PubMed:14521931, PubMed:15172994, PubMed:15737997, PubMed:32289254, PubMed:32610081, PubMed:35857590). Activates JNK through phosphorylation of MAP2K4/MKK4 and MAP2K7/MKK7, and MAP kinase p38 gamma (MAPK12) via phosphorylation of MAP2K3/MKK3 and MAP2K6/MKK6 (PubMed:11836244, PubMed:12220515). Involved in stress associated with adrene**

Develop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting. The output should mirror the organization and style of the template, without introducing new sections such as "Summary" or "Conclusion".
Also, do not interpret results. For example **DO NOT** add sentences to interpret the findings (such as **suggesting that**, etc.)
ONLY consider publications and ignore clinical trials/patents/opentargets.
Prioritize articles with a higher number of citations and prioritize domain leading or highest impact journals.

This template provides an example of expected **section headers, structure and writing tone**. Use it solely to guide the format. You are encouraged to improve the depth and comprehensiveness of your response without being repetitive and speculative.
