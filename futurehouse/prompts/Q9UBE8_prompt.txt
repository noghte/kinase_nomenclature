# Information

**Protein Name: Serine/threonine-protein kinase NLK / gene: NLK LAK1**
**Uniprot Id: Q9UBE8**
**Protein alternative names: Nemo-like kinase; Protein LAK1**
**Protein Function: Serine/threonine-protein kinase that regulates a number of transcription factors with key roles in cell fate determination (PubMed:12482967, PubMed:14960582, PubMed:15004007, PubMed:15764709, PubMed:20061393, PubMed:20874444, PubMed:21454679). Positive effector of the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway, acting downstream of WNT5A, MAP3K7/TAK1 and HIPK2 (PubMed:15004007, PubMed:15764709). Negative regulator of the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway (PubMed:12482967). Binds to and phosphorylates TCF7L2/TCF4 and LEF1, promoting the dissociation of the TCF7L2/LEF1/beta-catenin complex from DNA, as well as the ubiquitination and subsequent proteolysis of LEF1 (PubMed:21454679). Together these effects inhibit the transcriptional activation of canonical Wnt/beta-catenin target genes (PubMed:12482967, PubMed:21454679). Negative regulator of the Notch signaling pathway (PubMed:20118921). Binds to and phosphorylates NOTCH1, thereby preventing the formation of a transcriptionally activ**

Develop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting. The output should mirror the organization and style of the template, without introducing new sections such as "Summary" or "Conclusion".
Also, do not interpret results. For example **DO NOT** add sentences to interpret the findings (such as **suggesting that**, etc.)
ONLY consider publications and ignore clinical trials/patents/opentargets.
Prioritize articles with a higher number of citations and prioritize domain leading or highest impact journals.

This template provides an example of expected **section headers, structure and writing tone**. Use it solely to guide the format. You are encouraged to improve the depth and comprehensiveness of your response without being repetitive and speculative.
