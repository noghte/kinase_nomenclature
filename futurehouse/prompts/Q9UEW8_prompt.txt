# Information

**Protein Name: STE20/SPS1-related proline-alanine-rich protein kinase / gene: STK39 (STLK3) PASK; SPAK**
**Uniprot Id: Q9UEW8**
**Protein alternative names: DCHT; Serine/threonine-protein kinase 39**
**Protein Function: Effector serine/threonine-protein kinase component of the WNK-SPAK/OSR1 kinase cascade, which is involved in various processes, such as ion transport, response to hypertonic stress and blood pressure (PubMed:16669787, PubMed:18270262, PubMed:21321328, PubMed:34289367). Specifically recognizes and binds proteins with a RFXV motif (PubMed:16669787, PubMed:21321328). Acts downstream of WNK kinases (WNK1, WNK2, WNK3 or WNK4): following activation by WNK kinases, catalyzes phosphorylation of ion cotransporters, such as SLC12A1/NKCC2, SLC12A2/NKCC1, SLC12A3/NCC, SLC12A5/KCC2 or SLC12A6/KCC3, regulating their activity (PubMed:21321328). Mediates regulatory volume increase in response to hyperosmotic stress by catalyzing phosphorylation of ion cotransporters SLC12A1/NKCC2, SLC12A2/NKCC1 and SLC12A6/KCC3 downstream of WNK1 and WNK3 kinases (PubMed:12740379, PubMed:16669787, PubMed:21321328). Phosphorylation of Na-K-Cl cotransporters SLC12A2/NKCC1 and SLC12A2/NKCC1 promote their activation and i**

Develop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting. The output should mirror the organization and style of the template, without introducing new sections such as "Summary" or "Conclusion".
Also, do not interpret results. For example **DO NOT** add sentences to interpret the findings (such as **suggesting that**, etc.)
ONLY consider publications and ignore clinical trials/patents/opentargets.
Prioritize articles with a higher number of citations and prioritize domain leading or highest impact journals.

This template provides an example of expected **section headers, structure and writing tone**. Use it solely to guide the format. You are encouraged to improve the depth and comprehensiveness of your response without being repetitive and speculative.
