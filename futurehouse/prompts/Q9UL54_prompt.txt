# Information

**Protein Name: Serine/threonine-protein kinase TAO2 / gene: TAOK2 (TAO2) KIAA0881; MAP3K17; PSK; PSK1**
**Uniprot Id: Q9UL54**
**Protein alternative names: Kinase from chicken homolog C; Prostate-derived sterile 20-like kinase 1; Thousand and one amino acid protein kinase 2**
**Protein Function: Serine/threonine-protein kinase involved in different processes such as membrane blebbing and apoptotic bodies formation DNA damage response and MAPK14/p38 MAPK stress-activated MAPK cascade. Phosphorylates itself, MBP, activated MAPK8, MAP2K3, MAP2K6 and tubulins. Activates the MAPK14/p38 MAPK signaling pathway through the specific activation and phosphorylation of the upstream MAP2K3 and MAP2K6 kinases. In response to DNA damage, involved in the G2/M transition DNA damage checkpoint by activating the p38/MAPK14 stress-activated MAPK cascade, probably by mediating phosphorylation of upstream MAP2K3 and MAP2K6 kinases. Isoform 1, but not isoform 2, plays a role in apoptotic morphological changes, including cell contraction, membrane blebbing and apoptotic bodies formation. This function, which requires the activation of MAPK8/JNK and nuclear localization of C-terminally truncated isoform 1, may be linked to the mitochondrial CASP9-associated death pathway. Isoform 1 binds to microtubul**

Develop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting. The output should mirror the organization and style of the template, without introducing new sections such as "Summary" or "Conclusion".
Also, do not interpret results. For example **DO NOT** add sentences to interpret the findings (such as **suggesting that**, etc.)
ONLY consider publications and ignore clinical trials/patents/opentargets.
Prioritize articles with a higher number of citations and prioritize domain leading or highest impact journals.

This template provides an example of expected **section headers, structure and writing tone**. Use it solely to guide the format. You are encouraged to improve the depth and comprehensiveness of your response without being repetitive and speculative.
