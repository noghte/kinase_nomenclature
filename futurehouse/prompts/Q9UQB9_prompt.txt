# Information

**Protein Name: Aurora kinase C / gene: AURKC (AurC) AIE2; AIK3; AIRK3; ARK3; STK13**
**Uniprot Id: Q9UQB9**
**Protein alternative names: Aurora 3; Aurora/IPL1-related kinase 3; Aurora/IPL1/Eg2 protein 2; Serine/threonine-protein kinase 13; Serine/threonine-protein kinase aurora-C**
**Protein Function: Serine/threonine-protein kinase component of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), a complex that acts as a key regulator of mitosis. The CPC complex has essential functions at the centromere in ensuring correct chromosome alignment and segregation and is required for chromatin-induced microtubule stabilization and spindle assembly. Also plays a role in meiosis and more particularly in spermatogenesis. Has redundant cellular functions with AURKB and can rescue an AURKB knockdown. Like AURKB, AURKC phosphorylates histone H3 at 'Ser-10' and 'Ser-28'. AURKC phosphorylates the CPC complex subunits BIRC5/survivin and INCENP leading to increased AURKC activity. Phosphorylates TACC1, another protein involved in cell division, at 'Ser-228'**

Develop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting. The output should mirror the organization and style of the template, without introducing new sections such as "Summary" or "Conclusion".
Also, do not interpret results. For example **DO NOT** add sentences to interpret the findings (such as **suggesting that**, etc.)
ONLY consider publications and ignore clinical trials/patents/opentargets.
Prioritize articles with a higher number of citations and prioritize domain leading or highest impact journals.

This template provides an example of expected **section headers, structure and writing tone**. Use it solely to guide the format. You are encouraged to improve the depth and comprehensiveness of your response without being repetitive and speculative.
