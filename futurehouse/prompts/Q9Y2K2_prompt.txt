# Information

**Protein Name: Serine/threonine-protein kinase SIK3 / gene: SIK3 (QSK) KIAA0999; QSK**
**Uniprot Id: Q9Y2K2**
**Protein alternative names: Salt-inducible kinase 3; Serine/threonine-protein kinase QSK**
**Protein Function: Positive regulator of mTOR signaling that functions by triggering the degradation of DEPTOR, an mTOR inhibitor. Involved in the dynamic regulation of mTOR signaling in chondrocyte differentiation during skeletogenesis (PubMed:30232230). Negatively regulates cAMP signaling pathway possibly by acting on CRTC2/TORC2 and CRTC3/TORC3 (Probable). Prevents HDAC4 translocation to the nucleus (By similarity)**

Develop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting. The output should mirror the organization and style of the template, without introducing new sections such as "Summary" or "Conclusion".
Also, do not interpret results. For example **DO NOT** add sentences to interpret the findings (such as **suggesting that**, etc.)
ONLY consider publications and ignore clinical trials/patents/opentargets.
Prioritize articles with a higher number of citations and prioritize domain leading or highest impact journals.

This template provides an example of expected **section headers, structure and writing tone**. Use it solely to guide the format. You are encouraged to improve the depth and comprehensiveness of your response without being repetitive and speculative.
