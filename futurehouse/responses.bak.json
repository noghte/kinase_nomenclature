    "answer": "1. Phylogeny  \nSerine/threonine‑protein kinase H1 (PSKH1) is a member of the non‐specific serine/threonine protein kinase family (EC 2.7.11.1), a broad group of enzymes that are evolutionarily conserved across eukaryotes (anti2009nonspecificserinethreonineprotein pages 1-7). Within the human kinome, PSKH1 is grouped alongside other serine/threonine kinases that share a common catalytic domain and regulatory features. Orthologs of PSKH1 have been identified in several species, including mammals, yeast, and plants, reflecting the deep phylogenetic conservation of the kinase catalytic machinery (anti2009nonspecificserinethreonineprotein pages 13-16). Its inclusion with kinases that regulate diverse processes—from cell cycle control to RNA processing—suggests that PSKH1 lies within a core set of kinases whose origin dates back to the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (anti2009nonspecificserinethreonineprotein pages 7-10).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nThe catalytic reaction performed by PSKH1 conforms to the universal kinase mechanism in which ATP is used as a phosphate donor to phosphorylate serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins. The generalized reaction is:  \nATP + protein-[L-serine or L-threonine] → ADP + protein-[phospho-L-serine or phospho-L-threonine] + H⁺ (anti2009nonspecificserinethreonineprotein pages 19-22, anti2009nonspecificserinethreonineprotein pages 34-37). Although specific substrates of PSKH1 are still under extensive study, the reaction mechanism is consistent with other non-specific serine/threonine kinases that utilize conserved catalytic motifs to promote phosphotransfer.\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nLike many protein kinases, PSKH1 requires divalent metal ions to facilitate the phosphotransfer reaction. Mg²⁺ is the most common cofactor needed for ATP binding and proper positioning within the active site (anti2009nonspecificserinethreonineprotein pages 19-22). In some contexts, Mn²⁺ may also support kinase activity, but Mg²⁺ remains the primary cofactor essential for catalytic function in serine/threonine kinases such as PSKH1.\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nPSKH1 is proposed to participate in the regulation of pre-mRNA processing by phosphorylating components of nuclear splice factor compartments. In particular, it appears to target non-snRNP splicing factors containing serine/arginine-rich (SR) domains (Information section; anti2009nonspecificserinethreonineprotein pages 97-99). The phosphorylation of SR proteins by PSKH1 is thought to modulate their nucleoplasmic release and local concentration, which in turn influences alternative splicing decisions. Although a detailed consensus motif specific to PSKH1 substrates has not yet been fully elucidated, the kinase is expected to recognize features similar to other serine/threonine kinases in this family. Such enzymes sometimes prefer motifs with basic residues preceding the phosphoacceptor serine/threonine; hence, phosphorylation of SR proteins, known to contain repeated arginine–serine dipeptides, underscores the likely physiological substrate preference for PSKH1 (anti2009nonspecificserinethreonineprotein pages 37-39, anti2009nonspecificserinethreonineprotein pages 25-27).\n\n5. Structure  \nThe domain organization of PSKH1 is characteristic of serine/threonine kinases. It contains a central catalytic (kinase) domain that harbors the conserved motifs required for ATP binding and phosphotransfer. Although no high-resolution crystal structure specific to PSKH1 is reported in the provided context, predicted models (e.g., those from AlphaFold) likely reveal a typical kinase fold consisting of an N-terminal lobe mainly composed of β‑sheets and a C‑terminal lobe rich in α‑helices (anti2009nonspecificserinethreonineprotein pages 97-99). Unique to PSKH1 is its subcellular distribution—localization studies have shown that it is present in centrosomes, the Golgi apparatus, and the nucleus, suggesting additional targeting sequences or regulatory domains that mediate its partitioning within the cell (anti2009nonspecificserinethreonineprotein pages 97-99). Moreover, recent findings indicate that PSKH1 undergoes lipidation modifications, such as myristoylation and palmitoylation, which are known to contribute to the membrane association and spatial regulation of kinases (gormal2024locationlocationlocation pages 9-11). These post-translational modifications may serve to anchor PSKH1 near specialized nuclear or Golgi subdomains involved in spliceosome assembly.\n\n6. Regulation  \nRegulation of PSKH1 activity is expected to involve several mechanisms common to serine/threonine kinases. Autophosphorylation events within the activation loop can enhance catalytic activity, while reversible phosphorylation of regulatory domains may serve to modulate substrate access and enzyme activity (anti2009nonspecificserinethreonineprotein pages 84-87). In addition, lipidation through myristoylation and palmitoylation—as reported in recent studies—likely influences its subcellular localization, thereby indirectly controlling access to spliceosomal substrates (gormal2024locationlocationlocation pages 9-11). Genetic studies have also indicated that mutations in PSKH1, such as a missense mutation (valine to aspartic acid) observed in an ENU-induced mouse model, lead to a significant reduction in protein expression (~58%), suggesting that protein stability and expression levels are an important facet of its regulation (ji2015anenuinducedpoint pages 77-83). While specific upstream kinases or phosphatases that modify PSKH1 remain to be fully characterized, its inclusion within the non-specific serine/threonine kinase family implies that it may be regulated in a manner analogous to other kinases involved in spliceosome regulation.\n\n7. Function  \nThe principal proposed function of PSKH1 is its involvement in pre-mRNA processing regulation. By phosphorylating key non-snRNP splicing factors—particularly those containing extensive serine/arginine-rich regions—PSKH1 can alter the assembly and dynamics of nuclear splice factor compartments (Information section; anti2009nonspecificserinethreonineprotein pages 97-99). Through the reversible phosphorylation of SR proteins, PSKH1 is likely to modulate the release of these proteins into the nucleoplasm, thereby influencing alternative splicing events. This regulatory capacity is critical for controlling gene expression and generating protein diversity, with broad implications for cell differentiation and function. PSKH1 expression patterns suggest that it may be ubiquitously expressed, although its enriched localization to the nucleus, centrosomes, and Golgi implies roles not only in splicing but also possibly in cell cycle regulation and intracellular trafficking (anti2009nonspecificserinethreonineprotein pages 7-10, ji2015anenuinducedpoint pages 77-83). Mutational analysis linking PSKH1 to kidney developmental defects further underscores its biological significance and suggests that disruption of its kinase activity can have pathological consequences.\n\n8. Other Comments  \nThere are currently no well‐established inhibitors reported specifically for PSKH1 in the literature provided, and detailed studies on its disease associations remain limited. However, the identification of a missense mutation in the Pskh1 gene that co-segregates with a nephronophthisis-like kidney phenotype in mice indicates that alterations in PSKH1 function or expression may contribute to disease (ji2015anenuinducedpoint pages 77-83). This mutation, which causes a substitution of a nonpolar valine to a negatively charged aspartic acid, likely disrupts the protein’s conformation and stability, as evidenced by the observed reduction in protein expression. Additionally, the role of lipidation in directing PSKH1 localization (myristoylation and palmitoylation) may serve as a potential regulatory node for future therapeutic design, especially if aberrant localization is linked to dysfunction in splicing regulation (gormal2024locationlocationlocation pages 9-11). Ongoing research is aimed at elucidating the complete set of substrates and interacting partners of PSKH1, as well as the downstream signaling pathways affected by its kinase activity. Such studies will be critical for understanding the full cellular impact of PSKH1 and for the potential development of targeted therapies in diseases where pre-mRNA splicing is dysregulated.\n\n9.

    "answer": "## 1. Phylogeny  \nInterleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) is a member of a small but evolutionarily conserved family of serine/threonine kinases that mediate signal transduction downstream of innate immune receptors. Within this family, IRAK1 is closely related to IRAK2, IRAK3 (also known as IRAK‑M), and IRAK4, and these kinases have been preserved throughout vertebrate evolution because of their indispensable roles in regulating inflammation. Comparative sequence analyses reveal that IRAK1 harbors highly conserved catalytic motifs and regulatory domains that are maintained across a wide range of mammalian species, attesting to its essential function in rapidly propagating signals from Toll‑like receptors (TLRs) and interleukin‑1 receptors (IL‑1Rs) (bennett2022irak1andirak4 pages 1-2, patra2016recentprogressin pages 1-3). In the broader context of the kinome, IRAK1 is classified among receptor-interacting protein kinases with a canonical bilobal structure typical of serine/threonine kinases, and it shares similarities with other kinases that occupy critical positions in immune and inflammatory networks. Orthologs of IRAK1 have been identified in various species, implying that the underlying mechanisms of innate immune activation mediated by IRAK1 are conserved not only in mammalian systems but also in diverse vertebrates, lending support to the idea that IRAK1 and its homologs form an evolutionary core set of immune regulators (moret2020aresourcefor pages 23-26, patra2016recentprogressin pages 1-3).\n\n## 2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nIRAK1 catalyzes the phosphorylation of specific serine and threonine residues on target proteins by transferring a phosphate group from ATP. The chemical reaction it mediates can be generally represented as:  \n  ATP + [protein]-(Ser/Thr) → ADP + [protein]-(Ser/Thr)-phosphate + H⁺  \nThis phosphorylation is central to the mechanism by which IRAK1 propagates signals in TLR and IL‑1R pathways. In its canonical role, IRAK1 phosphorylates members of the Pellino family of E3 ubiquitin ligases (specifically PELI1, PELI2, and PELI3). The phosphorylation of these ligases induces conformational changes that significantly increase their E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, leading to the assembly of K63‑linked polyubiquitin chains on IRAK1 and other signaling intermediates. The process of polyubiquitination following IRAK1 activity is a key regulatory step as it facilitates the recruitment of the ubiquitin‑binding protein IKBKG/NEMO, which is essential for the formation of the TAK1 (MAP3K7)–TRAF6–IKK complex that ultimately activates NF‑κB (bahia2015interleukin1receptorassociated pages 17-17). In addition to Pellino proteins, IRAK1 phosphorylates the adaptor TIRAP, marking it for ubiquitination and degradation; this serves as a negative feedback mechanism to curtail prolonged signaling. Furthermore, phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) by IRAK1 is critical for its dimerization and nuclear translocation, events that lead to the transcriptional activation of type I interferon genes and the establishment of an antiviral state (seganish2016inhibitorsofinterleukin1 pages 1-6). Under conditions where IRAK1 undergoes sumoylation, the kinase translocates into the nucleus and phosphorylates STAT3, thus bridging cytoplasmic inflammatory signaling to direct regulation of gene transcription in the nucleus (chaudhary2015recentadvancesin pages 1-2, mcelroy2019interleukin1receptorassociatedkinase pages 21-25).\n\n## 3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic function of IRAK1, as with most serine/threonine protein kinases, is critically dependent on the presence of divalent metal ion cofactors. Specifically, IRAK1 requires Mg²⁺ ions for its enzymatic activity. These metal ions coordinate with ATP within the kinase active site and stabilize the negative charges of the phosphate groups, thereby facilitating the proper positioning of ATP for the transfer of the γ‑phosphate to target serine or threonine residues (bahia2015interleukin1receptorassociated pages 17-17, wang2017crystalstructureof pages 6-6). Although in some biochemical systems alternative divalent metal ions such as Mn²⁺ may substitute, physiological studies strongly indicate that Mg²⁺ is the primary cofactor utilized by IRAK1 during its catalytic cycle. The dependence on Mg²⁺ is an intrinsic aspect of IRAK1’s operation in the cellular milieu, where magnesium concentrations are tightly regulated to support proper kinase function.\n\n## 4. Substrate Specificity  \nDetermining substrate specificity is key to understanding how IRAK1 orchestrates precise signaling events in response to immune challenges. Although no universally acknowledged linear consensus sequence has been defined for its substrates, IRAK1 exhibits a marked preference for several physiologically relevant proteins. The Pellino family proteins (PELI1, PELI2, and PELI3) are among the most thoroughly characterized substrates; IRAK1 phosphorylates these E3 ubiquitin ligases to trigger their activation, thereby promoting the formation of K63‑linked polyubiquitin chains (bahia2015interleukin1receptorassociated pages 17-17, seganish2016inhibitorsofinterleukin1 pages 19-22). In addition to the Pellino proteins, IRAK1 phosphorylates the adaptor protein TIRAP, which is subsequently ubiquitinated and degraded—a process that is hypothesized to serve as a mechanism for attenuating signal transduction after activation (mcelroy2019interleukin1receptorassociatedkinase pages 21-25). Another key substrate is IRF7, whose phosphorylation by IRAK1 is essential for its dimerization and nuclear import, thereby initiating a transcriptional program leading to type I interferon production (chaudhary2015recentadvancesin pages 1-2). Moreover, when IRAK1 is post‐translationally modified by SUMO, it undergoes nuclear translocation and engages STAT3 as a substrate; the phosphorylation of STAT3 is implicated in modulating transcriptional programs associated with cell survival and proliferation (pereira2023regulationofinnate pages 1-2). Although detailed mapping of exact amino acid motifs is still under investigation, the available data strongly suggest that IRAK1 preferentially targets substrate proteins involved in the regulation of immune and inflammatory processes, likely recognizing docking sequences or structural features that enable specific binding to its catalytic cleft (seganish2016inhibitorsofinterleukin1 pages 22-26, mcelroy2019interleukin1receptorassociatedkinase pages 21-25).\n\n## 5. Structure  \nIRAK1 is characterized by a multidomain architecture that underpins both its catalytic function and its role as a scaffold within signaling complexes. At the N-terminus, IRAK1 contains a death domain (DD) comprising roughly 90–100 amino acids. This domain facilitates homotypic protein–protein interactions and is crucial for binding to adaptor proteins like MYD88, thereby mediating IRAK1’s recruitment to activated receptor complexes (mcelroy2019interleukin1receptorassociatedkinase pages 25-32, bahia2015interleukin1receptorassociated pages 1-2). Centrally, IRAK1 features a proline/serine/threonine-rich (ProST) region that acts as a flexible linker and serves as a major hub for autophosphorylation events during activation; extensive phosphorylation within this region is thought to drive conformational changes essential for transition from an inactive to an active state. \n\nThe catalytic core of IRAK1 lies in its C-terminal kinase domain, which adopts the canonical bilobal fold typical of many serine/threonine kinases. The N-terminal lobe generally contains a glycine-rich loop that is indispensable for ATP binding, while the C-terminal lobe forms the substrate-binding region. Structural studies, including crystallographic investigations of the IRAK1 kinase domain, have provided insights into key residues, such as a conserved tyrosine that functions as a gatekeeper; this residue is often a determinant of inhibitor specificity and distinguishes IRAK1 from its homolog IRAK4 (wang2017crystalstructureof pages 1-1, paul2020genome‐wideandstructural pages 8-9). Notably, unlike certain kinases that form stable homodimers in their inactive state, IRAK1 is predominantly monomeric until it is recruited to the myddosome. Within this higher-order complex, IRAK1 can heterodimerize with phosphorylated IRAK4, an event that is critical for its initial activation by IRAK4-mediated phosphorylation. In addition, post‑translational modifications such as sumoylation can alter the conformation of IRAK1 and promote its nuclear translocation, further highlighting the structural adaptability of this kinase (lange2021dimericstructureof pages 1-3, mcelroy2019interleukin1receptorassociatedkinase pages 25-32).\n\n## 6. Regulation  \nThe regulatory landscape governing IRAK1 activity is complex and finely tuned to allow rapid initiation and timely termination of immune signaling. A primary regulatory mechanism is the sequential phosphorylation cascade that begins upon ligand binding to TLRs or IL‑1Rs. The adaptor protein MYD88 first recruits IRAK1 to the receptor complex, where IRAK4 phosphorylates IRAK1. This initial phosphorylation event primes IRAK1 for extensive autophosphorylation, a modification that is essential for achieving full catalytic activation (bennett2022irak1andirak4 pages 1-2, patra2016recentprogressin pages 1-3). Once activated, IRAK1 phosphorylates its substrates to propagate the signal; however, these same phosphorylation events also set in motion negative regulatory feedback loops. For example, phosphorylation of TIRAP by IRAK1 leads to its ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation, effectively curtailing the signal to prevent chronic inflammation (mcelroy2019interleukin1receptorassociatedkinase pages 21-25).\n\nIn addition to phosphorylation, ubiquitination plays a key role in regulating IRAK1. The kinase phosphorylates the Pellino family E3 ubiquitin ligases, which then mediate K63‑linked polyubiquitination of IRAK1. These polyubiquitin chains serve as molecular scaffolds for the subsequent recruitment of IKBKG/NEMO, linking early receptor signaling to the activation of downstream kinases such as TAK1 and the IKK complex (seganish2016inhibitorsofinterleukin1 pages 22-26, bahia2015interleukin1receptorassociated pages 17-17). The ubiquitin-mediated modifications not only promote the assembly of signaling complexes but also can mark IRAK1 for degradation when conjugated via K48-linked chains, thereby contributing to signal termination.\n\nAnother regulatory mechanism involves sumoylation of IRAK1. When sumoylated, IRAK1 translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus where it phosphorylates substrates such as STAT3. This nuclear function not only extends IRAK1’s role beyond immediate inflammatory responses but also influences longer-term transcriptional regulation that can affect cell survival and proliferation (pereira2023regulationofinnate pages 1-2, reinhardt2023acriticalevaluation pages 22-23). Collectively, the regulation of IRAK1 is a dynamic process encompassing kinase activation by IRAK4, extensive autophosphorylation, ubiquitin- and SUMO-dependent modifications, and controlled degradation; these processes collectively ensure that innate immune responses are both robust and precisely modulated.\n\n## 7. Function  \nIRAK1 is a critical mediator of innate immune signaling and plays a central role in initiating and coordinating cellular responses to pathogens. Upon engagement of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by TLRs or binding of IL‑1 to its receptor, MYD88 recruits IRAK1 into the receptor complex. Activation of IRAK1 by IRAK4-dependent phosphorylation and subsequent autophosphorylation initiates a cascade of events that culminate in the activation of major transcription factors involved in inflammatory responses. A principal downstream effect is the phosphorylation of the Pellino family E3 ubiquitin ligases, which facilitates the assembly of K63‑linked ubiquitin chains and the subsequent recruitment of IKBKG/NEMO. This, in turn, enables the formation of the TAK1–TRAF6 complex and activation of IKK kinases, which phosphorylate IκB proteins leading to their degradation and freeing NF‑κB to translocate into the nucleus and stimulate the transcription of pro‑inflammatory cytokines such as IL‑1β, TNF‑α, IL‑6, and IL‑18 (bahia2015interleukin1receptorassociated pages 17-17, seganish2016inhibitorsofinterleukin1 pages 22-26).\n\nIn addition to promoting NF‑κB signaling, IRAK1 also phosphorylates IRF7, a transcription factor that, when activated, dimerizes and enters the nucleus to drive the expression of type I interferon genes. This function is particularly important in the antiviral response, enabling cells to establish an antiviral state through interferon production (chaudhary2015recentadvancesin pages 1-2). Furthermore, the capacity of IRAK1 to phosphorylate TIRAP not only contributes to the activation cascade but also ensures the subsequent termination of signaling by marking TIRAP for ubiquitination and degradation. \n\nBeyond its classical cytoplasmic functions, IRAK1 can be modified by SUMO and translocated into the nucleus, where it phosphorylates STAT3. This nuclear activity links IRAK1 to the regulation of gene expression programs involved in cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation, thereby extending its functional influence to processes such as oncogenesis and tissue repair (pereira2023regulationofinnate pages 1-2, mcelroy2019interleukin1receptorassociatedkinase pages 25-32). Expressed broadly in diverse immune cells such as monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, T and B lymphocytes, and natural killer cells, IRAK1 is indispensable for a rapid and robust immune response and plays a key role in maintaining immune homeostasis. Dysregulation of IRAK1 has been linked to pathological conditions including autoimmune disorders, chronic inflammatory diseases, and certain cancers where aberrant NF‑κB signaling contributes to tumorigenesis (bennett2022irak1andirak4 pages 1-2, mcelroy2019interleukin1receptorassociatedkinase pages 21-25).\n\n## 8. Other Comments  \nGiven its central role in both inflammatory and antiviral signaling, IRAK1 has emerged as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in a variety of immune‐ and inflammation‐related disorders. The hierarchical nature of IRAK1 activation—situated downstream of IRAK4—has led drug discovery efforts to explore not only direct IRAK1 kinase inhibitors but also indirect strategies aimed at disrupting its interactions within the myddosome complex. Several small molecule inhibitors have been developed that target IRAK1’s ATP binding site or interfere with its ability to phosphorylate downstream substrates; such compounds are often evaluated in parallel with IRAK4 inhibitors because blockade of upstream phosphorylation results in diminished IRAK1 activation (genung2017smallmoleculeinhibition pages 1-5, hatcher2020discoveryofa pages 5-6). \n\nIn addition, modulation of post‑translational modifications such as ubiquitination and sumoylation represents another promising strategy to regulate IRAK1 activity. Inhibitors that disrupt Pellino-mediated ubiquitination may attenuate the assembly of downstream signaling complexes, leading to reduced NF‑κB activation. Furthermore, the dual function of IRAK1 in both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments underscores the possibility that selective inhibition of its nuclear functions (for instance, blocking STAT3 phosphorylation) could offer refined therapeutic windows with minimized systemic immunosuppression (liu2021leveragingdiversedata pages 69-74, wiese2020investigationalirak4inhibitors pages 17-21).\n\nBeyond therapeutic inhibitor development, IRAK1’s dysregulation has been implicated in a broad array of inflammatory pathologies, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and various cancers wherein chronic inflammation plays a role in disease progression. Characterization of unique mutations or alterations in expression levels of IRAK1 in such conditions can potentially serve as biomarkers for disease prognosis or as indicators for personalized therapy approaches. Current research is increasingly focusing on the network of interactions between IRAK1 and other immune modulators, as well as understanding how species and cell type-specific differences in IRAK1 function might impact the efficacy of targeted therapies (reinhardt2023acriticalevaluation pages 22-23, zarrin2021kinaseinhibitionin pages 8-9).\n\nAdditionally, structural and biophysical studies continue to elucidate the molecular details governing IRAK1’s substrate recognition and activation dynamics. Such insights not only further our understanding of innate immune signaling but also feed directly into the rational design of next-generation inhibitors that are both potent and highly selective for IRAK1. As our knowledge of IRAK1’s multifaceted roles expands, so too does the prospect of manipulating its regulatory mechanisms to finely tune immune responses in a clinical setting.\n\n## 9.

    "answer": "1. Phylogeny  \nIRAK3 is a member of the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) family, which also comprises the catalytically active IRAK1, IRAK2, and IRAK4. Although it shares the common domain architecture of an N-terminal death domain (DD), a central kinase (or pseudokinase) domain, and a C-terminal region, IRAK3 has diverged in function from its paralogs by losing key catalytic residues. Phylogenetic analyses show that IRAK3 is broadly conserved across vertebrates, underscoring its ancient role in regulating innate immunity. Within the kinome, IRAK3 is grouped with the Pelle family kinases and is considered a regulatory or pseudokinase that emerged early during evolution of TLR/IL-1 receptor signaling complexes. Its orthologs can be identified in species ranging from mammals to other vertebrates, placing it in an evolutionarily conserved subgroup of IRAK proteins that have adapted specialized roles in modulating immune responses (degorce2020discoveryofproteolysistargeting pages 1-2, lange2021dimericstructureof pages 1-3).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nUnlike conventional protein kinases that catalyze ATP-dependent phosphorylation of protein substrates, IRAK3 functions primarily as a regulatory scaffold rather than as an active enzyme. It lacks the full complement of catalytic residues found in active kinases and therefore does not efficiently mediate phosphoryl-transfer to a target substrate. Instead, IRAK3 modulates signaling downstream of immune receptors by inhibiting the phosphorylation and subsequent dissociation of IRAK1 and IRAK4 from the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling complex. In effect, its “reaction” is one of interference or stabilization of protein–protein interactions within the Myddosome, rather than the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to serine/threonine residues (degorce2020discoveryofproteolysistargeting pages 1-2, zhou2024il1receptorassociatedkinase pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nAlthough IRAK3 is classified as a pseudokinase with minimal catalytic activity, its structured kinase-like domain still retains an ATP-binding pocket. Structural studies indicate that IRAK3 binds ATP with very low affinity relative to active kinases; for example, its nucleotide interaction is demonstrably weak, with an estimated dissociation constant (Kd) that suggests little to no occupancy under physiological conditions. Despite having a conserved ATP-binding site element, IRAK3 does not require the metal ion cofactors (such as Mg²⁺) in the conventional sense for catalysis. Rather, any bound ATP is likely involved in maintaining structural conformation or allosteric regulation rather than driving a phosphoryl-transfer reaction (lange2021dimericstructureof pages 6-7).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nIRAK3 does not exhibit typical kinase substrate specificity since it lacks robust catalytic phosphorylation activity. Instead, its regulatory role is mediated by specific interactions with other proteins within the TLR/IL-1 receptor signaling complex. Notably, IRAK3 is reported to inhibit the dissociation of IRAK1 and IRAK4 from the receptor complex, possibly through binding interfaces that recognize these kinases or associated adaptor proteins such as MyD88. Consequently, rather than phosphorylating a consensus motif (for example, RxRxx[pST] as in many serine/threonine kinases), IRAK3 functions by sequestering signaling molecules thereby modulating the downstream activation of NF-κB and related transcription factors (degorce2020discoveryofproteolysistargeting pages 1-2, gurkan2024theirakmdeath pages 1-2).\n\n5. Structure  \nIRAK3 is composed of multiple functional regions. At its N-terminus, a death domain mediates protein–protein interactions necessary for assembly of the Myddosome. The central region, normally defined as a kinase domain, has evolved into a pseudokinase domain that adopts a closed, pseudoactive conformation reminiscent of active kinases. Structural studies, notably crystallography at 2.9 Å resolution, reveal that IRAK3 forms a unique head-to-head homodimer mediated by interactions centered on its αC-helices and further stabilized by disulfide bridges and conserved hydrophobic contacts (e.g., involving residues such as L210 and E214). Its kinase domain harbors key modifications: canonical motifs are altered (for instance, the HRD motif is replaced by a ‘CGS’ sequence and the DFG motif is substituted by DFA), and the G-loop is notably stabilized by a conserved hydrophobic residue (F177) that forms a rigid network with nearby secondary structure elements. The overall three-dimensional structure preserves the typical bilobal kinase fold, yet the ATP-binding pocket is largely accessible to inhibitors such as staurosporine rather than ATP under physiological conditions (degorce2020discoveryofproteolysistargeting pages 1-2, lange2021dimericstructureof pages 3-4, lange2021dimericstructureof pages 6-7).\n\n6. Regulation  \nIRAK3 regulates downstream immune responses primarily by functioning as a negative modulator of TLR and IL-1 receptor signaling. Its regulatory mechanisms are as much structural as they are post-translational. Dimerization via its pseudokinase domain, which occurs through a head-to-head interface and involves key residues that are sensitive to redox conditions (e.g., the formation of disulfide bridges), is central to its activity. This dimerization may allosterically modulate interactions with IRAK4 or other signaling components, thereby inhibiting the phosphorylation events that are necessary for full activation of pro-inflammatory pathways. Additionally, studies have suggested that IRAK3 might stabilize the receptor complex by preventing the disassembly or excessive phosphorylation of IRAK1 and IRAK4, thereby attenuating NF-κB activation. Although specific post-translational modifications (such as phosphorylation on regulatory sites) have not been fully characterized for IRAK3, its interactions and dimerization status are clearly critical for its inhibitory function (lange2021dimericstructureof pages 7-8, lange2021dimericstructureof pages 11-12, gurkan2024theirakmdeath pages 15-16).\n\n7. Function  \nIRAK3 is predominantly expressed in leukocytes such as monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils, where it plays an essential role in modulating innate immune responses. Its primary function is to act as a negative regulator downstream of TLR and IL-1 receptor engagement, thereby dampening the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. By inhibiting the phosphorylation and subsequent dissociation of IRAK1 and IRAK4 from the receptor complex, IRAK3 stabilizes the Myddosome and prevents overactivation of NF-κB-dependent transcription. This role is critical in preventing hyperinflammatory states and autoimmune manifestations. In addition, under certain pathological conditions—such as IL-33-induced lung inflammation and in specific cancer contexts including colorectal cancer and lung adenocarcinoma—IRAK3 has been implicated in modulating cytokine expression profiles (increasing IL6, CSF3, CXCL2, and CCL5 mRNAs) and influencing immune cell infiltration, thereby affecting both inflammatory and tumor microenvironment dynamics (degorce2020discoveryofproteolysistargeting pages 1-2, zhou2024il1receptorassociatedkinase pages 1-2).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nAlthough lacking classical catalytic activity, IRAK3 is a promising therapeutic target due to its central role in regulating immune receptor signaling. Recent studies have exploited its unique ATP-binding pocket—despite its weak affinity for ATP—to develop proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) that selectively induce its degradation, thereby modulating the inflammatory response. Disease associations include its involvement in immune dysregulation observed in conditions such as persistent asthma, certain cancers (e.g., colorectal cancer and lung adenocarcinoma), and neuroinflammatory conditions. Notable mutations, some of which cluster on conserved surfaces involved in dimerization and interaction with IRAK4, have been linked to altered function and may serve as biomarkers or therapeutic targets. Current areas of active research focus on elucidating the precise structural mechanisms of its allosteric regulation and on developing small molecules or biological agents to modulate its stability and interactions, with the goal of fine-tuning immune responses in pathological conditions (degorce2020discoveryofproteolysistargeting pages 1-2, lange2021dimericstructureof pages 9-10, gurkan2024theirakmdeath pages 1-2).\n\n9.

    "answer": "1. Phylogeny  \nTAOK1 is an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine kinase that belongs to the STE20 kinase family and specifically to the MAP3K subgroup, with close relationships to its paralogs TAOK2 and TAOK3 (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 1-3, byeon2024pleiotropicfunctionsof pages 1-3). Its kinase domain is highly conserved across species, with orthologs documented in invertebrates such as Drosophila (Tao) and Caenorhabditis elegans (KIN-18), as well as in vertebrates including fish, rodents, and humans, indicating that the core signaling roles of TAOK1 were established early in evolution (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 3-4, ying2024roleofste20typea pages 25-27). Phylogenetic studies position TAOK1 within a cluster of protein kinases that mediate stress-activated MAPK cascades, underscoring its ancestral connection to the STE20 family members that predominate in eukaryotic signaling networks (byeon2024pleiotropicfunctionsof pages 29-34, fang2020thediverseroles pages 1-3).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nTAOK1 functions as a serine/threonine-protein kinase, catalyzing the phosphorylation of specific protein substrates by transferring a phosphate group from ATP to serine or threonine residues on the target proteins. The chemical reaction can be summarized as: ATP + [protein substrate] → ADP + [protein substrate]-phosphate + H⁺ (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 6-7, ning2025multiomicsanalysisrevealed pages 14-16). Physiologically, TAOK1 directly phosphorylates MAP kinase kinase substrates such as MAP2K3 and MAP2K6, thereby acting as an upstream activator of the p38/MAPK14 stress-activated cascade. In addition, it phosphorylates MARK2 at Thr208, which leads to its activation and subsequent phosphorylation of MAPT/tau, resulting in the detachment of tau from microtubules and thereby regulating cytoskeletal stability (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 1-3, fang2020thediverseroles pages 11-13).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of TAOK1, similar to many serine/threonine kinases, is dependent on the binding of ATP as a phosphate donor along with essential divalent metal ions such as Mg²⁺ which are required to stabilize the charged phosphate groups during the transfer reaction (ning2025multiomicsanalysisrevealed pages 14-16, ying2024roleofste20typea pages 74-76). Although the detailed characterization of additional cofactor or regulatory molecule requirements for TAOK1 remains to be fully elucidated, it follows the canonical mechanism observed in the kinase superfamily where ATP and Mg²⁺ are indispensable for phosphorylation activity (byeon2024pleiotropicfunctionsof pages 4-6, hu2021clinicalandneurobiological pages 2-3).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nTAOK1 exhibits substrate specificity for serine/threonine residues and has been demonstrated to phosphorylate proteins critical for MAP kinase cascades and cytoskeletal regulation. Its physiological substrates include MAP2K3 and MAP2K6, whose phosphorylation leads to downstream activation of p38 MAPK; it also phosphorylates MARK2, thereby modulating microtubule dynamics through the detachment of tau protein from microtubules (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 1-3, beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 6-7). The consensus specificity likely revolves around recognition of target motifs that include nearby basic residues, and the kinase shows a preference for threonine phosphorylation, as suggested by analyses of phosphorylation events and the autophosphorylation regulation that involves key threonine residues (byeon2024pleiotropicfunctionsof pages 12-14, fang2020thediverseroles pages 13-15). Although precise consensus motifs have not been universally defined for TAOK1, experimental evidence points to its pivotal role in modulating substrates that govern both stress responses and cytoskeletal reorganization (byeon2024pleiotropicfunctionsof pages 7-9, yoder2023geneexpressionanalysis pages 10-12).\n\n5. Structure  \nTAOK1 is a large protein, approximately 1001 amino acids in length, with a multidomain architecture that is crucial for its function. The N-terminal region contains a highly conserved kinase domain (approximately residues 1–320), which is responsible for its catalytic activity. This domain is characterized by the conventional serine/threonine kinase fold that binds ATP and facilitates phosphoryl transfer (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 3-4, dulovicmahlow2019denovovariants pages 3-4). Immediately following the kinase domain, TAOK1 features a series of predicted coiled-coil motifs that mediate protein–protein interactions, and these regions are implicated in subcellular localization and membrane association. Notably, the C-terminal segment also contains a unique triple helix structure that directly binds phosphoinositides and is essential for plasma membrane association and membrane remodeling (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 1-3, byeon2024pleiotropicfunctionsof pages 3-4). Critical regulatory residues include autophosphorylation sites such as Thr440 and Thr443, whose phosphorylation status controls the enzyme's switch between an active cytosolic state and an inactive membrane-bound state (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 25-26, byeon2024pleiotropicfunctionsof pages 18-19). Structural predictions from AlphaFold2.0 further support this domain organization and highlight the spatial separation between the catalytic core and membrane-interactive regions (ying2024roleofste20typea pages 25-27, fang2020thediverseroles pages 5-8).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe activity of TAOK1 is intricately regulated by multiple post-translational modifications and protein–protein interactions. One of the central regulatory mechanisms is autophosphorylation; TAOK1 autophosphorylates residue Ser181 within its catalytic loop, which is crucial for its kinase activity, and it also phosphorylates residues Thr440 and Thr443 that regulate its localization by modulating plasma membrane association (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 6-7, beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 25-26). In addition, TAOK1 is subject to regulation by upstream kinases such as MST3, part of the Hippo signaling pathway, which phosphorylates TAOK1 and influences dendritic spine formation in neuronal cells (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 15-20, byeon2024pleiotropicfunctionsof pages 16-18). Its kinase activity is also modulated by interactions with cellular lipids; the triple helix in the C-terminal region binds phosphoinositides, and this membrane interaction is negatively regulated by autophosphorylation (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 1-3, byeon2024pleiotropicfunctionsof pages 3-4). Furthermore, disease-associated mutations within the kinase domain render TAOK1 catalytically inactive, trapping it in a membrane-bound state and leading to aberrant membrane remodeling, which in turn distorts neuronal development (dulovicmahlow2019denovovariants pages 1-2, byeon2024pleiotropicfunctionsof pages 11-12). These layers of regulation ensure that TAOK1’s activity is tightly controlled in response to diverse cellular signals such as DNA damage, stress, and extracellular cues (hu2021clinicalandneurobiological pages 3-4, fang2020thediverseroles pages 17-19).\n\n7. Function  \nTAOK1 plays multifaceted roles in cellular physiology, prominently functioning as a key mediator in stress-activated signaling pathways and in maintaining cytoskeletal stability. It contributes to the activation of the p38/MAPK14 cascade by phosphorylating MAP2K3 and MAP2K6, thus playing a critical role in the DNA damage response and in cell cycle checkpoint regulation at the G2/M transition (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 6-7, ning2025multiomicsanalysisrevealed pages 11-14). By phosphorylating MARK2 at Thr208, TAOK1 indirectly influences the stability of microtubules through the timely detachment of MAPT/tau from microtubule filaments; this function is vital for proper cytoskeletal remodeling and neuronal polarity (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 1-3, fang2020thediverseroles pages 11-13). In addition to its role in stress response and cytoskeletal dynamics, TAOK1 is implicated in the regulation of apoptosis. It participates in the activation of the MAPK8/JNK cascade, thereby modulating apoptotic morphological changes such as cell contraction, membrane blebbing, and the formation of apoptotic bodies (byeon2024pleiotropicfunctionsof pages 29-34, fang2020thediverseroles pages 19-20). TAOK1 is also essential in the nervous system; its high expression in mammalian brain regions including the hippocampus, neocortex, and cerebellum underscores its involvement in neuronal development, dendritic arborization, and migration to the cortical plate. Dysfunctional TAOK1, as observed in cases with de novo missense and truncating mutations, leads to impaired dendritic branching and abnormal neuronal morphology, which are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders such as intellectual disability, developmental delay, and autism spectrum disorder (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 15-20, dulovicmahlow2019denovovariants pages 1-2, hu2021clinicalandneurobiological pages 5-6). Therefore, TAOK1 integrates extracellular stress signals with intracellular responses by modulating key signaling cascades that influence cell growth, survival, cytoskeletal rearrangements, and neural connectivity (byeon2024pleiotropicfunctionsof pages 16-18, hu2021clinicalandneurobiological pages 6-8).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nInhibitor development targeting TAOK1 is an area of active research given its central roles in stress response, apoptosis, and neurodevelopment. Although specific TAOK1 inhibitors have not yet been fully optimized, related studies using broad-spectrum or TAOK family inhibitors have provided insights into its potential as a therapeutic target in neurodevelopmental disorders and certain cancers (ying2024roleofste20type pages 74-76, ning2025multiomicsanalysisrevealed pages 11-14). Mutations in TAOK1 have been identified in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders, and these variants often result in a loss of kinase activity and aberrant plasma membrane association, thus leading to defects in neuronal morphology and connectivity (dulovicmahlow2019denovovariants pages 2-3, beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 3-4). In addition, TAOK1′s involvement in pathways such as the p38 MAPK cascade and JNK activation links it to responses to DNA damage and cellular stress, which may further connect its dysregulation to oncogenic processes (ning2025multiomicsanalysisrevealed pages 14-16, byeon2024pleiotropicfunctionsof pages 18-19). Ongoing research is focused on elucidating the precise mechanisms that control its autophosphorylation, subcellular localization, and interactions with regulatory proteins, as well as on mapping its complete substrate spectrum using phosphoproteomics (fang2020thediverseroles pages 16-17, hu2021clinicalandneurobiological pages 1-2). The multiplicity of TAOK1’s roles in neuronal migration, cytoskeletal dynamics, and stress signaling makes it a critical node in both normal physiology and disease, and further studies are anticipated to clarify its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders (byeon2024pleiotropicfunctionsof pages 19-20, wernigg2025theserinethreoninekinase pages 88-91).\n\n9.

    "answer": "1. Phylogeny  \nRIPK1 (Receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1) is a widely conserved serine/threonine kinase that belongs to the RIP kinase family, a subgroup within the broader kinome of serine/threonine kinases. Within this family, RIPK1 is distinguished by its modular architecture consisting of an N-terminal kinase domain, an intermediate domain containing a conserved RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM), and a C-terminal death domain. These domains enable it to interact with other RIP kinases, most notably RIPK3, to orchestrate programmed cell death processes such as necroptosis. Evolutionary studies indicate that RIPK1 and RIPK3 share a common ancestry with other death domain–containing kinases and have been conserved throughout mammalian evolution, with orthologs identified in mouse, human, and likely other vertebrates, ensuring similar functions in inflammatory and cell death signalling across species (OpenTargets Search: -RIPK1, quarni2016vdrripk1interactionand pages 15-20). Moreover, phylogenetic analyses based on substrate motif selectivity have clustered RIPK1 within the RIPK/WNK subgroup of serine/threonine kinases, emphasizing its evolutionary relationships with kinases that share both catalytic and regulatory features (johnson2023anatlasof pages 4-5).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nAs a protein kinase, RIPK1 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues on specific substrate proteins. The canonical reaction is:  \n  ATP + [protein] (serine/threonine residue) → ADP + [protein]-phospho-(serine/threonine) + H⁺.  \nThis catalytic activity facilitates both autophosphorylation and trans-phosphorylation events. Notably, RIPK1 engages in reciprocal phosphorylation with RIPK3 in the necroptotic signaling cascade, although the full spectrum of its direct substrates remains incompletely delineated. One well-characterized substrate is DAB2IP, phosphorylated at Ser-728 in a TNF-α–dependent manner, thereby triggering downstream signalling cascades such as activation of MAP3K5-JNK (Protein Function information, meng2021theregulationof pages 13-15). In addition to phosphorylating other proteins, RIPK1’s autophosphorylation (including critical sites such as S161 and S166) plays a pivotal role in regulating its kinase activity and subsequent signal propagation in cell death pathways (meng2021theregulationof pages 8-9).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of RIPK1, like that of many serine/threonine kinases, is dependent on divalent metal ions, with magnesium (Mg²⁺) being the most common cofactor required to coordinate ATP binding and facilitate phosphoryl transfer. Although explicit experimental data on metal ion dependency is not extensively detailed in the current excerpts, it is standard for kinases of this class to utilize Mg²⁺, and no additional non‐metal cofactors have been highlighted for RIPK1 (OpenTargets Search: -RIPK1, mitroshina2023necroptosisincns pages 10-11).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nRIPK1 exhibits substrate specificity that is characterized by its ability to phosphorylate itself (autophosphorylation) and select downstream target proteins implicated in cell death and inflammatory responses. Its physiological substrates include RIPK3, with which it forms a reciprocal phosphorylation relationship essential for necroptosis, and DAB2IP, where phosphorylation at Ser-728 triggers the activation of the MAP3K5–JNK apoptotic cascade (Protein Function information, meng2021theregulationof pages 13-15). Although specific consensus phosphorylation motifs for RIPK1 have not been definitively established in the provided literature, the fact that it phosphorylates serine/threonine residues suggests that it recognizes structural features common to its substrates. The atlas of substrate specificities for human serine/threonine kinases (johnson2023anatlasof pages 4-5) implies that RIPK1, as a member of this kinase family, might share preferences that could be revealed by motif analysis in large-scale phosphoproteomic studies. However, compared to classical substrate motifs found in other kinases, RIPK1’s substrate recognition appears to be closely linked to its recruitment into multiprotein complexes (e.g., the necrosome) and to its autophosphorylation status (meng2021theregulationof pages 8-9).\n\n5. Structure  \nRIPK1 is architecturally organized into three main domains that contribute to its dual roles as both a catalytic enzyme and a scaffold protein.  \n• The N-terminal kinase domain (approximately the first 300 amino acids) harbors the ATP-binding pocket and contains critical autophosphorylation sites (e.g., S161, S166) that are vital for its catalytic activity. This domain is responsible for executing the phosphorylation reaction and regulating subsequent cell death signals (quarni2016vdrripk1interactionand pages 20-25, zhou2024ripk3signalingand pages 1-2).  \n• The intermediate domain, approximately 300 amino acids long, includes the conserved RHIM motif that enables homotypic interactions with RIPK3. This interaction is essential for the formation of the necrosome, a key complex in necroptotic cell death (quarni2016vdrripk1interactionand pages 15-20, meng2021theregulationof pages 3-4).  \n• The C-terminal death domain mediates interactions with other proteins involved in death receptor signalling, such as FADD and TRADD, thereby facilitating the assembly of signaling complexes (TNF-RSC/complex I) that determine cell survival versus death outcomes (quarni2016vdrripk1interactionand pages 29-33, meng2021theregulationof pages 4-5).  \nRecent structural studies, including comparisons of the murine RIPK1 modeled via Robetta with the human kinase domain structure (PDB ID 7FD0), have validated the conservation of the kinase domain structure and highlighted key catalytic residues within the ATP binding pocket, although detailed atomic-level descriptions of all domains are still evolving (malireddi2023wholegenomecrisprscreen pages 16-16).\n\n6. Regulation  \nRIPK1 is subject to complex multilayered regulation through an array of post-translational modifications (PTMs) that modulate its catalytic activity, interaction capabilities, and overall function in cell death and inflammatory signalling pathways.  \n• Phosphorylation: RIPK1 is phosphorylated at multiple serine residues including S6, S14/15, S25, S89, S161, and S166 within the kinase domain and additional sites in the intermediate region (S321, among others). While autophosphorylation (notably at S161 and S166) is a hallmark of its activation, phosphorylation by external kinases such as IKK1/2, TAK1, MK2, and ULK1 exerts inhibitory effects that prevent excessive activation of cell death pathways like necroptosis (meng2021theregulationof pages 7-7, meng2021theregulationof pages 8-9, quarni2016vdrripk1interactionand pages 20-25).  \n• Ubiquitination: The addition of ubiquitin chains, particularly K63-linked and M1-linked chains, on residues such as K376 (or equivalent K377 in human RIPK1) plays a crucial role in scaffolding functions by retaining RIPK1 within the TNF receptor–associated complex (complex I) to promote NF-κB activation and cell survival. Conversely, K48-linked ubiquitination by enzymes like CHIP targets RIPK1 for proteasomal degradation, thereby modulating its levels and activity (meng2021theregulationof pages 9-11, quarni2016vdrripk1interactionand pages 29-33).  \n• Proteolytic Cleavage: Caspase-8–mediated cleavage of RIPK1 acts as a negative regulator by truncating RIPK1 and inhibiting its ability to drive necroptosis (Protein Function information, meng2021theregulationof pages 4-5).  \n• Allosteric Modulation: Binding of small molecule inhibitors like Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) changes the conformational dynamics of RIPK1, leading to inhibition of its kinase activity and subsequent prevention of necroptosis, illustrating a form of allosteric regulation (mitroshina2023necroptosisincns pages 10-11, oh2024spatiotemporalcontrolof pages 16-17).  \nTogether, these PTMs create a regulatory network that fine-tunes RIPK1’s function, balancing its kinase-dependent activities (e.g., initiation of necroptosis) against its scaffold role in promoting NF-κB–mediated cell survival (meng2021theregulationof pages 7-8, quarni2016vdrripk1interactionand pages 20-25).\n\n7. Function  \nRIPK1 plays a central role in modulating cell fate decisions in response to extracellular signals, particularly those initiated by tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Its functions can be broadly categorized into two interrelated aspects:  \n• Kinase-Dependent Functions: The catalytic activity of RIPK1 is critical for the induction of programmed cell death. Upon TNF receptor activation, when apoptotic signalling is compromised (for example, by caspase-8 inhibition), activated RIPK1 promotes the assembly of a death-inducing complex (complex IIb) with RIPK3 and MLKL, ultimately triggering necroptosis. Similarly, its kinase activity contributes to the formation of complex IIa (comprising RIPK1, FADD, and caspase-8) to drive apoptosis under certain conditions. These kinase-dependent processes ensure that cells can be eliminated in a controlled manner, which is particularly important during immune responses and tissue homeostasis (Protein Function information, meng2021theregulationof pages 1-2, mitroshina2023necroptosisincns pages 10-11).  \n• Scaffold Functions: Independent of its kinase activity, RIPK1 acts as a scaffold protein when recruited to the TNF receptor 1 signaling complex (complex I). In this context, it facilitates the activation of the NF-κB pathway, promoting the transcription of pro-survival and pro-inflammatory genes such as interleukin-6 (IL6). This activity is crucial not only for cell survival but also for mounting effective inflammatory responses (Protein Function information, meng2021theregulationof pages 4-5, OpenTargets Search: -RIPK1).  \nIn development, RIPK1 is essential for preventing aberrant activation of caspase-8–dependent apoptosis, thus ensuring normal embryogenesis by limiting interactions that would otherwise lead to excessive cell death (Protein Function information, quarni2016vdrripk1interactionand pages 29-33).  \nFurthermore, by phosphorylating substrates like DAB2IP, RIPK1 can also activate apoptotic cascades such as the MAP3K5-JNK pathway, linking it to additional layers of cell fate regulation (Protein Function information, meng2021theregulationof pages 13-13).  \nCollectively, RIPK1 integrates signals from death receptors and innate immune pathways, dictating whether a cell undergoes apoptosis, necroptosis, or survives via NF-κB–mediated transcriptional programs (OpenTargets Search: -RIPK1, zhou2024ripk3signalingand pages 1-2).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nRIPK1 is emerging as both a promising drug target and a biomarker for several diseases. Genetic studies and pathway analyses have strongly linked RIPK1 with inborn errors of immunity, neurodegenerative diseases, severe acute respiratory syndrome, autoinflammatory syndromes, and immunodeficiency disorders (OpenTargets Search: -RIPK1). The development of small molecule inhibitors, such as Necrostatin-1 and other clinical candidates like DNL788, underscores the therapeutic potential of targeting RIPK1 kinase activity to modulate necroptosis and inflammatory responses (mitroshina2023necroptosisincns pages 11-12, oh2024spatiotemporalcontrolof pages 16-17). Moreover, because of its dual role in regulating apoptosis and necroptosis and acting as a scaffold for NF-κB activation, dysregulation of RIPK1 can have profound implications in cancer, autoimmune disorders, and inflammatory diseases. Recent research continues to focus on mapping the complete repertoire of RIPK1’s post-translational modifications and uncovering how these modifications coordinate with cellular signaling networks (meng2021theregulationof pages 7-8, quarni2016vdrripk1interactionand pages 25-29). Notable mutations affecting key phosphorylation and ubiquitination sites have not been detailed in the available excerpts; however, the emphasis on these modification sites suggests that even subtle alterations could critically impact RIPK1 activity. Exploration of the interplay between RIPK1 and its interacting partners, such as RIPK3, FADD, and TRADD, remains an active area of investigation with potential for yielding novel therapeutic insights (quarni2016vdrripk1interactionand pages 96-99, OpenTargets Search: -RIPK1).\n\n9.

    "answer": "1. Phylogeny  \nRIPK2 (Receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 2), also known as CARDIAK, RICK, or RIP2, is a member of the receptor-interacting protein (RIP) kinase family. It occupies a distinct phylogenetic niche among kinases involved in innate immune regulation, exhibiting both serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation capabilities that are not prominent in some of its homologs such as RIPK1, RIPK3, or RIPK4 (chirieleison2016syntheticbiologyreveals pages 1-2, cuny2021ripkproteinkinase pages 1-2). Although all RIP kinases share a conserved kinase domain, the evolutionary trajectory of RIPK2 has led to the acquisition of a unique caspase recruitment domain (CARD) that enables specific CARD–CARD interactions with the NOD1 and NOD2 receptors. Orthologs of RIPK2 are found widely throughout vertebrates, indicating that its role in linking bacterial sensing to downstream immune responses emerged early in vertebrate evolution and has been maintained by strong purifying selection (chirieleison2016syntheticbiologyreveals pages 2-4, cuny2021ripkproteinkinase pages 2-3).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nRIPK2 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to specific serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues on substrate proteins. The general chemical reaction is represented as:  \n  ATP + [protein]–OH → ADP + [protein]–O–PO₃²⁻ + H⁺  \nIn its signaling role, RIPK2 undergoes autophosphorylation, which is critical for its function. In addition, it phosphorylates substrates that participate in the propagation of NF-κB and MAP kinase signaling cascades, particularly in pathways downstream of NOD1 and NOD2 receptors (barczyk20244anilinoquinazolinederivativesas pages 41-42, he2017identificationofpotent pages 1-4). Although the precise molecular mechanism and identity of all physiological substrates remain subjects of active research, its dual-specificity allows it to modulate both serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation events inherent to the modulation of innate and adaptive immune responses.\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nRIPK2 enzymatic activity depends on the presence of ATP as the phosphate donor, and like many kinases, it requires divalent metal ions—most notably Mg²⁺—to facilitate the coordination of ATP in the catalytic cleft (barczyk20244anilinoquinazolinederivativesas pages 41-42, pham2023recentadvancesin pages 1-3). The binding of Mg²⁺ stabilizes the negative charges on the phosphate groups of ATP and is essential for optimal positioning of the nucleotide for phosphoryl transfer. While Mg²⁺ is the primary metal ion requirement, some kinase reactions may also be supported by Mn²⁺ under specific experimental conditions, although available literature primarily supports the role of Mg²⁺ in RIPK2-catalyzed reactions.\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nRIPK2 exerts its function by phosphorylating a select array of substrates that participate in the innate immune response. Key substrates include itself (as demonstrated by autophosphorylation events) and proteins that are components of the downstream NF-κB and MAPK signaling cascades. Notably, RIPK2 has been linked to the tyrosine phosphorylation of the guanine exchange factor ARHGEF2, an event that contributes to NOD2-mediated NF-κB activation (barczyk20244anilinoquinazolinederivativesas pages 41-42, pham2023recentadvancesin pages 17-18). Although comprehensive mapping of the consensus phosphorylation motif for RIPK2 is still emerging, the kinase domain’s dual specificity is evidenced by its ability to modify both serine/threonine and tyrosine residues, suggesting that substrate recognition may involve conformational determinants as well as primary amino acid sequence motifs (chirieleison2016syntheticbiologyreveals pages 7-9, pham2023recentadvancesin pages 18-19). Recent studies highlight that substrate specificity is particularly critical for the proper recruitment of downstream effectors, such as the NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO), which becomes ubiquitinated in a RIPK2-dependent manner following phosphorylation events.\n\n5. Structure  \nRIPK2 is a multidomain protein whose architecture is composed of a central kinase domain, an intermediate linker region, and a C-terminal caspase recruitment domain (CARD). The N-terminal kinase domain adopts a typical bilobal structure common to serine/threonine and dual-specificity kinases and contains a conserved ATP-binding pocket with key residues—such as a catalytic lysine (e.g., Lys209) that is critical for ATP coordination—and motifs like the DFG and HXD sequences that are essential for phosphoryl transfer (heim2020aregulatoryinterface pages 21-23, cuny2021ripkproteinkinase pages 10-10).  \nThe intermediate domain, although less well characterized, is thought to contribute to the structural flexibility necessary for RIPK2’s autophosphorylation and helps facilitate interactions between the kinase domain and regulatory factors. The C-terminal CARD domain mediates homotypic interactions with other CARD-containing proteins, most notably the NOD1 and NOD2 receptors, thereby driving the formation of higher-order oligomeric signaling complexes (chirieleison2016syntheticbiologyreveals pages 9-11, misehe2024designsynthesisand pages 44-49).  \nStructural studies, including crystallography and predictive modeling (e.g., via AlphaFold), have reinforced the presence of conserved motifs and residues necessary for catalysis and regulation, and have also highlighted unique features such as a smaller threonine gatekeeper residue that may render RIPK2 more amenable to allosteric inhibition (cuny2021ripkproteinkinase pages 2-3, lethier2023structureshowsthat pages 1-2). The combined domain organization endows RIPK2 with both catalytic activity and the ability to function as a scaffold, integrating both enzymatic and protein–protein interaction roles within innate immune signaling pathways.\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of RIPK2 is governed by a multilayered network of post-translational modifications that modulate its enzymatic activity, stability, protein interactions, and signal transduction capability. A key regulatory step is its autophosphorylation, which occurs on multiple serine, threonine, and particularly a crucial tyrosine residue (e.g., Tyr474) that is essential for maximum signaling output in response to NOD receptor activation (chirieleison2016syntheticbiologyreveals pages 7-9, zare2022theroleof pages 32-35).  \nIn addition to autophosphorylation, RIPK2 is subject to extensive ubiquitination. Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin chains, as well as Met-1-linked (linear) ubiquitin chains, are attached to RIPK2 by E3 ubiquitin ligases such as XIAP, BIRC2, BIRC3, and the LUBAC complex. These ubiquitin modifications are pivotal for serving as docking platforms that recruit downstream signaling components, including NEMO, TAB2/3, and TAK1 complexes, which collectively propagate NF-κB activation (barczyk20244anilinoquinazolinederivativesas pages 41-42, topal2021ripk2nodsto pages 6-11).  \nEnzymes such as A20, CYLD, OTULIN, and MYSM1 act as deubiquitinases to remove these ubiquitin chains, thereby fine-tuning signaling intensity and duration (heim2020aregulatoryinterface pages 7-9, topal2021ripk2nodsto pages 15-19). Notably, while RIPK2’s kinase activity is dispensable for certain aspects of NOD1/2-mediated NF-κB activation, its regulatory autophosphorylation and ubiquitination remain essential for the formation of signaling complexes and the proper recruitment of downstream effectors (barczyk20244anilinoquinazolinederivativesas pages 41-42, topal2021ripk2nodsto pages 15-19). Allosteric regulation through conformational changes and protein–protein interactions further influences its scaffold function, and recent structural insights have begun to elucidate mechanisms by which small-molecule inhibitors can disrupt critical interfaces, such as the RIPK2–XIAP interaction (cuny2021ripkproteinkinase pages 10-10, chirieleison2016syntheticbiologyreveals pages 11-15).\n\n7. Function  \nRIPK2 plays a central role in initiating and modulating both innate and adaptive immune responses. It is best known as the key effector that mediates signaling downstream of the NOD1 and NOD2 receptors, which detect bacterial peptidoglycan motifs such as diaminopimelic acid and muramyl dipeptide. Upon recognition of these microbial products, NOD receptors oligomerize and recruit RIPK2 via CARD–CARD interactions, triggering RIPK2 autophosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination events that serve to activate NF-κB and MAP kinase pathways (barczyk20244anilinoquinazolinederivativesas pages 41-42, topal2021ripk2nodsto pages 1-6).  \nOnce activated, RIPK2 functions as a scaffold, assembling multi-protein complexes that eventually lead to upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Beyond its pivotal role in innate immunity, RIPK2 also contributes to adaptive immune functions; for example, it participates in T-cell receptor engagement and BCL10 phosphorylation, thereby influencing NF-κB activation during T-cell responses (barczyk20244anilinoquinazolinederivativesas pages 41-42, topal2021ripk2nodsto pages 15-19).  \nAdditionally, RIPK2 is implicated in cytoskeletal regulation via its ability to modulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of the guanine exchange factor ARHGEF2, leading to alterations in RHOA-mediated signaling and affecting cell morphology and migration (barczyk20244anilinoquinazolinederivativesas pages 41-42). Such diverse functions underscore its importance in orchestrating immune defenses, inflammation, cell survival, and apoptosis, making it a multifunctional hub whose dysregulation has been linked to several autoinflammatory and autoimmune disorders.\n\n8. Other Comments  \nInhibitors targeting RIPK2 have become an intense area of pharmacological research due to the protein’s pivotal role in inflammatory and immune signaling. Agents such as GSK583, OD36, OD38, and Ponatinib have been characterized as potent inhibitors that interfere with RIPK2’s kinase domain and/or its ability to interact with XIAP, thereby dampening NF-κB activation (bryan2018kinaseinhibitorsfor pages 16-17, he2017identificationofpotent pages 1-4). Although the kinase activity of RIPK2 is not strictly required for NOD1/2-mediated NF-κB signaling, the inhibition of its autophosphorylation and ubiquitination has proven effective in reducing inflammatory responses in preclinical models.  \nRIPK2 dysregulation is associated with a variety of human disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Blau syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, and certain types of cancer. Genetic mutations or aberrant post-translational modifications that affect RIPK2’s stability, catalytic function, or its ability to interact with key adaptors (such as XIAP) have been implicated in these conditions (zare2022theroleof pages 65-67, topal2021ripk2nodsto pages 28-34).  \nCurrent research focuses on refining the selectivity and potency of RIPK2 inhibitors while minimizing off-target effects. Structural insights obtained from X-ray crystallography and advanced modeling approaches (e.g., AlphaFold) have facilitated the design of inhibitors that target specific conformations of the RIPK2 kinase domain, thereby disrupting key protein–protein interactions necessary for its scaffolding function (lethier2023structureshowsthat pages 1-2, fan2023designsynthesisand pages 12-12).  \nFurthermore, the dual functional roles of RIPK2—both as an active kinase and as a scaffold—present unique challenges and opportunities for therapeutic intervention. While inhibition of catalytic activity may not completely block pathological signaling due to its scaffold function, targeting the regulatory interfaces involved in ubiquitination and adaptor recruitment shows promise for more effective modulation of downstream immune responses (heim2020aregulatoryinterface pages 9-12, chirieleison2016syntheticbiologyreveals pages 7-9).\n\n9.

    "answer": "1. Phylogeny  \nRIPK3 is a member of the receptor‐interacting protein kinase (RIPK) family, which groups within the serine/threonine kinases and is evolutionarily related to other RIPK family members such as RIPK1, RIPK2, and RIPK4. The phylogenetic analyses reveal that RIPK3 and its close relatives share a conserved kinase domain and a distinctive RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM) that is essential for protein–protein interactions integral to necroptosis signaling (lv2022comparativeandevolutionary pages 1-3, moriwaki2013rip3amolecular pages 1-3). Within the kinome classification, RIPK3 is placed in the tyrosine kinase-like (TKL) group even though its enzymatic activity is exclusively serine/threonine kinase in nature (cuny2021ripkproteinkinase pages 6-8). Orthologs of RIPK3 have been identified in diverse vertebrate species, although certain lineages such as birds and some mammals exhibit loss of the RIPK3 gene, which suggests that adaptive evolutionary pressures – potentially related to metabolic regulation and resistance to ischemia–reperfusion injury – have stimulated divergence in RIP kinase signaling pathways (lv2022comparativeandevolutionary pages 18-20, dondelinger2016anevolutionaryperspective pages 5-7). This conservation among species highlights the critical role of RIPK3 in innate immune responses and programmed cell death pathways.\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nRIPK3 catalyzes the transfer of the γ-phosphate from ATP to specific serine and threonine residues on substrate proteins, thereby phosphorylating them. The canonical reaction can be summarized as: ATP + [protein]–(Ser/Thr) → ADP + [protein]–(pSer/pThr) + H⁺ (murphy2015posttranslationalcontrolof pages 3-4). The primary physiological substrate of RIPK3 is the pseudokinase MLKL, whose phosphorylation by RIPK3 triggers its oligomerization and translocation to the plasma membrane, ultimately executing necroptosis by disrupting membrane integrity (moriwaki2013rip3amolecular pages 3-5, newton2015ripk1andripk3 pages 1-2). RIPK3 also engages in reciprocal auto- and trans-phosphorylation events with RIPK1, a process that is integral to the assembly and activation of the necrosome complex (cuny2021ripkproteinkinase pages 1-2, cook2014ripk1andripk3induced pages 12-13).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of RIPK3, like most kinases, is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions that act as cofactors; most notably, Mg²⁺ is required for proper ATP coordination and for facilitating phosphate transfer during the phosphorylation reaction (moriwaki2017theinflammatorysignal pages 7-10, newton2015ripk1andripk3 pages 1-2). Although explicit mention of Mn²⁺ or other metal ions is less common in the context of RIPK3 regulation, the structural and mechanistic parallels with other serine/threonine kinases support the necessity for divalent cations in its enzymatic function (gardner2023from(tool)benchto pages 1-2). Additionally, RIPK3’s kinase domain exhibits typical catalytic motifs that coordinate ATP binding and catalysis, suggesting that its regulation is intricately dependent on the availability and binding of ATP in a metal‐ion assisted manner (moriwaki2013rip3amolecular pages 3-5).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nRIPK3 displays substrate specificity primarily for proteins involved in programmed necrosis. Its most well-characterized substrate is MLKL; phosphorylation of MLKL by RIPK3 at critical serine/threonine residues (e.g., human S227 and murine T231/S232) is necessary for MLKL activation and subsequent necroptotic execution (zhou2024ripk3signalingand pages 1-2, moriwaki2013rip3amolecular pages 3-5). In addition, RIPK3 engages in reciprocal phosphorylation with RIPK1, suggesting that it may recognize specific structural features or motifs that facilitate interaction via the RHIM domain (newton2015ripk1andripk3 pages 1-2, cuny2021ripkproteinkinase pages 2-3). Although no clear consensus phosphorylation motif akin to the RxRxxp[ST] motif found in other serine/threonine kinases has been fully defined for RIPK3, its substrate recognition appears to be strongly influenced by protein–protein interactions mediated by its regulatory RHIM domain and by complex formation within the necrosome (raju2018kinasedomaindimerization pages 1-2, shlomovitz2017mechanismsofripk3‐induced pages 1-6).\n\n5. Structure  \nRIPK3 comprises an N-terminal serine/threonine kinase domain that harbors all the canonical motifs, including the ATP-binding P loop, the catalytic lysine (e.g., Lys50 in human RIPK3), and the conserved DFG, HRD motifs essential for catalysis (moriwaki2013rip3amolecular pages 3-5, cuny2021ripkproteinkinase pages 6-8). C-terminal to the kinase domain, RIPK3 contains a RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM) that is crucial for mediating interactions with other RHIM-containing proteins such as RIPK1, TRIF, and ZBP1; these interactions are vital for necrosome assembly and signaling (moriwaki2017theinflammatorysignal pages 22-23, shlomovitz2017mechanismsofripk3‐induced pages 6-9). Structural studies, including crystallography and AlphaFold models, indicate that the kinase domain adopts a typical bilobal structure with an N-lobe rich in β-sheets and a C-lobe predominantly composed of α-helices, forming the catalytic cleft in which ATP binds (cuny2021ripkproteinkinase pages 6-8). Unique structural features of RIPK3 include its small, hydrophilic gatekeeper residue that influences inhibitor access to its kinase domain and allows for some atypical conformational dynamics during activation (cuny2021ripkproteinkinase pages 6-8). The RHIM region itself, although predicted to be largely unstructured in isolation, forms amyloid-like fibrils upon interaction with partner proteins, providing a scaffold for kinase activation (shlomovitz2017mechanismsofripk3‐induced pages 9-13).\n\n6. Regulation  \nRIPK3 activity is subject to multiple layers of regulation that include both its catalytic activity and its scaffolding function. One key regulatory mechanism is auto- and trans-phosphorylation, wherein RIPK3 phosphorylates itself as well as RIPK1 within the necrosome complex; these phosphorylation events are required for the proper propagation of necroptotic signaling (cuny2021ripkproteinkinase pages 1-2, newton2015ripk1andripk3 pages 1-2). In addition, several post-translational modifications control RIPK3 function. Phosphorylation at specific residues, such as those within its activation loop (e.g., S227 in human RIPK3), is critical for its kinase activity and for the recruitment of downstream effectors such as MLKL (zhou2024ripk3signalingand pages 1-2, moriwaki2013rip3amolecular pages 3-5). Ubiquitination also plays a role in modulating RIPK3 stability and activity; ubiquitin ligases can target RIPK3 for proteasomal or lysosomal degradation, thereby acting as a negative regulatory mechanism (cuny2021ripkproteinkinase pages 6-8, murphy2015posttranslationalcontrolof pages 3-4). Furthermore, proteolytic cleavage by caspase-8 can inactivate RIPK3 and divert cell death away from necroptosis toward apoptosis, illustrating a kinase-independent function in cell death regulation (moriwaki2017theinflammatorysignal pages 10-13, shlomovitz2017mechanismsofripk3‐induced pages 6-9). During cell cycle progression, RIPK3 is phosphorylated at serine 369 by PLK1, a modification that stabilizes RIPK3 and promotes its incorporation into higher-order death-inducing complexes known as the ripoptosome, thereby linking cell cycle cues to cell death pathways (gupta2021plk1mediateds369phosphorylation pages 1-2, gupta2021plk1mediateds369phosphorylation pages 27-31). These regulatory events are critical for ensuring that RIPK3 activity is tightly controlled to prevent unwarranted cell death and inflammation.\n\n7. Function  \nRIPK3 is best known for its central role in the execution of necroptosis, a form of programmed necrosis that is characterized by rapid plasma membrane rupture and the induction of inflammation due to the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) (moriwaki2013rip3amolecular pages 3-5, newton2015ripk1andripk3 pages 1-2). In the canonical necroptotic pathway, RIPK3, upon activation by death receptor ligands such as TNF-α or by pattern recognition receptors via ZBP1, phosphorylates MLKL; activated MLKL oligomerizes and translocates to the plasma membrane to disturb membrane integrity, resulting in cell lysis and the subsequent inflammatory response (cuny2021ripkproteinkinase pages 6-8, zhou2024ripk3signalingand pages 1-2). Beyond necroptosis, RIPK3 has been implicated in apoptosis under certain conditions; for example, kinase-dead mutants of RIPK3 can trigger an alternative form of cell death in a RIPK1-, FADD-, and caspase-8-dependent manner, highlighting its role as a bifunctional mediator of cell death (moriwaki2017theinflammatorysignal pages 1-4, shlomovitz2017mechanismsofripk3‐induced pages 1-6). RIPK3 also contributes to antiviral responses independent of its cell death functions; in neuronal cells infected with Zika virus, RIPK3 helps establish a metabolic program that upregulates ACOD1/IRG1 and leads to the production of itaconate, a metabolite that inhibits succinate dehydrogenase and restricts viral replication (Information section, by similarity). In addition, RIPK3 modulates cellular metabolism through interactions with metabolic enzymes such as GLUL, GLUD1, and PYGL, thereby potentially influencing the tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (Information section, PubMed:19498109). Tissue-specific expression patterns indicate that RIPK3 is widely expressed in immune cells, where it regulates inflammatory cytokine production and inflammasome activation; in some contexts, RIPK3-dependent signaling contributes to the production of interferons and other cytokines that are crucial for innate immune responses (yang2023dichotomousrolesof pages 1-3, shlomovitz2017mechanismsofripk3‐induced pages 21-23). Collectively, the functions of RIPK3 encompass both cell death pathways – necroptosis and apoptosis – and cell survival/adaptive responses such as metabolic reprogramming and inflammatory signaling, positioning it as a key integrator of stress and immune signals.\n\n8. Other Comments  \nMultiple experimental inhibitors targeting the necroptotic pathway focus indirectly on RIPK3 by inhibiting upstream kinases such as RIPK1; however, several small molecule inhibitors that directly modulate RIPK3 activity are under investigation (martens2020inhibitorstargetingripk1ripk3 pages 2-4, martens2020inhibitorstargetingripk1ripk3 pages 4-6). Dysregulation of RIPK3 activity has been associated with a variety of pathological states including inflammatory diseases, ischemia–reperfusion injury, neurodegenerative conditions, and even certain cancers, given its role in both cell death and non-cell death signaling pathways (cuny2021ripkproteinkinase pages 6-8, morgan2022rolesofripk3 pages 1-2). Notable mutations that affect the kinase domain, such as kinase-dead mutants (e.g., D161N), have revealed that catalytic inactivity can sometimes drive alternative, gain-of-function apoptotic signaling, demonstrating a complex interplay between different modes of programmed cell death (moriwaki2017theinflammatorysignal pages 10-13, shlomovitz2017mechanismsofripk3‐induced pages 6-9). Current areas of active research include elucidating the detailed structural dynamics of RIPK3 during necrosome formation, the impact of various post-translational modifications on its function, and the development of therapeutically effective inhibitors that can selectively block its necroptotic function without triggering compensatory cell death pathways (gupta2021plk1mediateds369phosphorylation pages 27-31, urwylerrosselet2023functionsofthe pages 12-13). Additionally, RIPK3 has been recognized for its role in executing cell death in distinct subcellular compartments such as the nucleus, particularly in response to viral infections that induce Z-RNA formation, thereby expanding its functional repertoire beyond the cytoplasmic necrosome (Information section, by similarity; zhou2024ripk3signalingand pages 3-5). The complex regulation of RIPK3, involving autophosphorylation, interactions with RIPK1 and other adaptors via the RHIM domain, and modulation by ubiquitination and proteolysis, continues to be an intensive focus given its therapeutic potential for modulating inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases (cuny2021ripkproteinkinase pages 2-3, murphy2015posttranslationalcontrolof pages 3-4).\n\n9.

    "answer": "1. Phylogeny  \nRIPK4 (Receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 4) is classified within the receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK) family, a subgroup of the serine/threonine kinome that is distinguished by highly conserved kinase domains alongside divergent C‐terminal regulatory modules such as ankyrin repeats. In phylogenetic analyses, RIPK4 is grouped with RIPK1–RIPK5, which share structural features indicative of divergent functions in inflammatory signaling and cell death, whereas RIPK6 and RIPK7 (also referred to as LRRK1 and LRRK2) show more distant relationships and additional domains such as leucine-rich repeats and ROC/COR motifs (lv2022comparativeandevolutionary pages 10-12, zare2022theroleof pages 28-32). The evolutionary lineage of RIPK4 can be traced across vertebrates; orthologs have been identified in species such as human, mouse, and amphibians like Xenopus tropicalis, where the kinase domain conservation is notably high (fransen2011exploringtherole pages 131-137, huang2018crystalstructureof pages 1-3). This conservation of key structural elements underlines that RIPK4 fulfills an evolutionarily preserved role in epidermal differentiation and immune regulation (cuny2021ripkproteinkinase pages 1-2, lv2022comparativeandevolutionary pages 1-3).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nRIPK4 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to target serine/threonine residues on substrate proteins, a canonical reaction for serine/threonine protein kinases. In chemical terms, the reaction can be summarized as: ATP + [protein substrate] → ADP + [protein substrate]-phosphoserine/threonine + H⁺. Although the precise reaction mechanism in RIPK4 is not fully characterized, it is known to phosphorylate substrates such as plakophilin-1 (PKP1) and interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6), thus modulating keratinocyte differentiation, cell adhesion, and NF-κB activation (cuny2021ripkproteinkinase pages 6-8, zare2022theroleof pages 62-65).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of RIPK4, like that of other serine/threonine kinases, is dependent on the presence of divalent cations, with Mg²⁺ serving as the primary cofactor to stabilize the ATP–substrate complex during catalysis. While specific detailed studies of RIPK4 cofactor dependency are limited in the current literature, this requirement is consistent with the mechanistic attributes of the kinome group it belongs to (xu2020insightintothe pages 1-2, cuny2021ripkproteinkinase pages 2-3).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nRIPK4 preferentially phosphorylates serine/threonine residues on its physiological substrates, with known targets including PKP1 and IRF6, which play important roles in maintaining skin homeostasis and promoting keratinocyte differentiation. The recognition of substrates is mediated through its conserved kinase domain and may involve specific amino acid sequence motifs or structural determinants that facilitate substrate binding; for instance, the requirement to engage substrates at specific serine residues has been implicated in the regulation of NF-κB and Wnt signaling pathways (zare2022theroleof pages 62-65, chirieleison2016syntheticbiologyreveals pages 4-6). Although consensus motifs have not been definitively established for RIPK4, experiments using domain swapping approaches have suggested that its kinase domain shares functional similarities with that of RIPK2, implying a degree of substrate overlap despite the distinct C-terminal ankyrin repeats that confer additional regulatory specificity (chirieleison2016syntheticbiologyreveals pages 6-7, zare2022theroleofa pages 28-32).\n\n5. Structure  \nRIPK4 exhibits a modular structure characterized by an N-terminal kinase domain, a central intermediate region, and a C-terminal regulatory region that contains 11 ankyrin repeats. The kinase domain is responsible for the catalytic activity, displaying the canonical bilobal structure typical of serine/threonine kinases; it contains conserved motifs such as the P-loop, catalytic lysine, and activation loop that are essential for ATP binding and phosphotransfer (cuny2021ripkproteinkinase pages 1-2, huang2018crystalstructureof pages 1-3). The intermediate domain, although less well defined in terms of function, serves as a connector between the catalytic core and the regulatory ankyrin domain. The series of C-terminal ankyrin repeats are thought to contribute to protein–protein interactions and may modulate kinase activity by interfering with homo-dimerization or substrate access, features that are crucial for its role in NF-κB activation and epidermal differentiation (cuny2021ripkproteinkinase pages 8-8, fransen2011exploringtherole pages 137-139). Recent crystallographic analyses have also indicated that RIPK4 undergoes dimerization, which is necessary for its full catalytic activity and might represent an allosteric regulatory mechanism unique among RIP kinases (huang2018crystalstructureof pages 3-4, chirieleison2016syntheticbiologyreveals pages 7-9).\n\n6. Regulation  \nRIPK4 activity is tightly regulated at multiple levels, including post-translational modifications and protein–protein interactions. Phosphorylation events, both autophosphorylation and trans-phosphorylation by upstream kinases such as protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms (PKC-δ, PKC-β, and PKC-η), have been implicated in modulating its activity during epithelial differentiation (xu2020insightintothe pages 1-2, urwylerrosselet2023functionsofthe pages 10-11). In addition, RIPK4 is a direct transcriptional target of TP63, linking its expression to the differentiation state of keratinocytes (information section). Caspase-8–mediated cleavage events have also been reported to regulate the balance between pro-survival and pro-apoptotic signaling, as cleavage of RIPK4 can block NF-κB activation in apoptotic settings (stunnenberg…2021theroleof pages 5-6). Regulation by protein–protein interactions is further supported by the inhibitory role of its ankyrin repeat domain, which may act in an autoinhibitory fashion when not properly engaged with substrates or activators (cuny2021ripkproteinkinase pages 3-4, chirieleison2016syntheticbiologyreveals pages 9-11).\n\n7. Function  \nRIPK4 plays a critical role in embryonic skin development and the maintenance of epidermal homeostasis in adults. It functions primarily by phosphorylating key substrates such as PKP1, thereby promoting keratinocyte differentiation and enhancing cell adhesion, which are essential for the formation and integrity of the skin barrier (information section, kalay2012mutationsinripk4 pages 3-4). In addition to its role in the structural organization of the epidermis, RIPK4 is involved in intracellular signaling pathways that activate NF-κB, a transcription factor with pivotal roles in inflammation and cell survival. Its regulatory functions extend to the modulation of Wnt/β-catenin pathways, which are critical for cell fate determination during development (urwylerrosselet2023functionsofthe pages 10-11, zare2022theroleof pages 32-35). The conservation of RIPK4 expression in ectoderm-derived tissues, along with studies using model organisms such as mice and Xenopus, reinforces its central function in tissue differentiation and morphogenesis (fransen2011exploringtherole pages 131-137, lv2022comparativeandevolutionary pages 12-13). Furthermore, genetic aberrations in RIPK4, including point mutations that compromise its kinase activity, are associated with developmental syndromes such as popliteal pterygium syndrome and Bartsocas-Papas syndrome, underscoring its essential role in human skin biology (kalay2012mutationsinripk4 pages 3-4, urwylerrosselet2023functionsofthe pages 13-14).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nRIPK4 has garnered interest as a potential therapeutic target due to its dual roles in developmental signaling and inflammation. Experimental inhibitors that target related kinases within the RIP family have spurred efforts to design compounds with specificity for RIPK4, although the development of potent and selective small-molecule inhibitors remains in early stages (xie2021smallmoleculekinaseinhibitors pages 53-54). In addition to its implications in epidermal differentiation, aberrant RIPK4 activity has been linked to carcinogenesis, particularly in skin tumors, prompting further research into its roles beyond normal developmental processes (zare2022theroleof pages 62-65). Current research is also focusing on deciphering the precise molecular mechanisms by which RIPK4 influences NF-κB and Wnt signaling pathways, with the expectation that such insights might lead to novel interventions in inflammatory and oncogenic disorders (chirieleison2016syntheticbiologyreveals pages 4-6, urwylerrosselet2023functionsofthe pages 10-11).\n\n9.

    "answer": "1. Phylogeny  \nJanus kinase 1 (JAK1) is one of the four closely related members of the Janus kinase family, which also includes JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2. Its evolutionary conservation across species is underscored by the presence of highly similar domain architectures – including the FERM, SH2-like, pseudokinase, and tyrosine kinase (TK) domains – that appear in orthologous proteins from mammals to other vertebrates (caveney2023structuralbasisof pages 1-3). JAK1 belongs to the non-receptor tyrosine kinases of the Janus kinase group that operate primarily through receptor-associated signaling. The kinase family itself is part of a broader tyrosine kinase superfamily, demonstrating evolutionarily conserved catalytic and regulatory features that can be traced back to early eukaryotic ancestors (morris2018themoleculardetails pages 1-4). Among the JAK family, JAK1 exhibits ubiquitous expression in many tissues indicating its critical role in cytokine signaling, and its orthologs in diverse species display conservation of key regulatory residues and domain organizations that reflect functional constraints preserved through evolution (spinelli2021jak1numberone pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nJAK1 catalyzes a phosphorylation reaction in which the γ-phosphate from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is transferred to specific tyrosine residues on substrate proteins. In its canonical role, JAK1 phosphorylates tyrosine residues located within the intracellular domains of cytokine receptors, as well as on downstream signaling effectors, notably the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. This phosphorylation reaction converts ATP into adenosine diphosphate (ADP), while the targeted protein residue is converted into its phosphorylated form, thereby creating docking sites for downstream signaling molecules (morris2018themoleculardetails pages 27-31). The process involves transient binding of ATP in a cleft formed between the N-terminal and C-terminal lobes of the kinase domain, which is facilitated by structural features common among tyrosine kinases (caveney2023structuralbasisof pages 3-5). The reaction mechanism further depends on precise spatial orientation provided by protein dimerization that enables trans-phosphorylation events critical for full activation of the kinase (damerau2020jakstatactivationa pages 8-10).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of JAK1 is dependent on several cofactors. Like most protein kinases, JAK1 requires ATP as a phosphate donor for phosphoryl transfer reactions and relies on the presence of divalent metal ions—most notably magnesium (Mg²⁺)—to facilitate the proper binding and orientation of ATP in the catalytic site (lv2024thejakstatpathway pages 12-15). Other regulatory molecules may further influence kinase activity; for instance, interactions with inhibitory proteins such as SOCS1 modulate its function without directly interfering with ATP binding. Thus, JAK1’s enzymatic action is largely dependent on ATP and Mg²⁺ as essential cofactors for catalysis (morris2018themoleculardetails pages 27-31).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nJAK1 is known for its substrate specificity, which plays a critical role in mediating cytokine receptor signaling cascades. Physiologically, JAK1 phosphorylates the intracellular domains of cytokine receptors such as those for interferon (IFN-α/β/γ), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and interleukin-10 (IL-10), as well as the STAT family of transcription factors that dock via phosphotyrosine-binding domains. The enzyme preferentially targets tyrosine residues that reside in specific motifs within its substrates; in receptors, conserved sequences adjacent to Box1 and Box2 motifs are recognized and modified (lv2024thejakstatpathway pages 5-6). Furthermore, JAK1’s substrate specificity is dictated by its ability to interact with the receptor’s intracellular regions through its FERM-SH2 module, which ensures a correct spatial juxtaposition of catalytic and substrate residues to facilitate efficient phosphorylation (gruber2020complexautoinflammatorysyndrome pages 1-3, morris2018themoleculardetails pages 27-31). In addition, biochemical studies and motif-based analyses have revealed preferences in downstream substrates such as STAT proteins, although a precise consensus motif for JAK1 remains less stringently defined than for serine/threonine kinases (yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 19-22).\n\n5. Structure  \nJAK1 displays a modular architecture with several conserved domains that are critical for its function and regulation. At the N-terminus is the FERM domain, which, in collaboration with an adjacent SH2-like domain, mediates binding to cytokine receptor intracellular motifs such as Box1 and Box2; this interaction is central to its recruitment to receptor complexes (caveney2023structuralbasisof pages 1-3, lv2024thejakstatpathway pages 2-3). Adjacent to these is an evolutionarily conserved pseudokinase (PK) domain, which, although catalytically inactive, plays an essential autoregulatory role by modulating the conformation and activity of the C-terminal kinase domain. The tyrosine kinase (TK) domain is responsible for the enzyme’s catalytic activity, adopting a typical bilobal structure found in eukaryotic protein kinases – an N-terminal lobe largely composed of β-sheets and a C-terminal lobe primarily made up of α-helices. Structural studies employing cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and AlphaFold modeling have provided insights into the spatial arrangement of these domains; for example, in certain active conformations, the TK domains from JAK1 dimerize in a manner that facilitates trans-phosphorylation of the activation loops, a critical activation step (caveney2023structuralbasisof pages 13-19, caveney2023structuralbasisof pages 5-7). Key catalytic residues involved in ATP binding and phosphate transfer, typically found in the conserved VAIK, HRD, and DFG motifs, are present in the TK domain, while the PK domain contains regulatory residues whose mutation (such as the analogous V617F mutation in JAK2) can lead to constitutive activation (biggs2022humanjak1gain pages 19-20).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe activity of JAK1 is tightly modulated by a variety of regulatory mechanisms that ensure proper cellular signaling. One major regulator is the suppressor of cytokine signaling protein 1 (SOCS1), which binds to JAK1 via its kinase inhibitory region (KIR), blocking the substrate-binding groove and thus inhibiting kinase activity in a non–ATP competitive manner (liau2018themolecularbasis pages 1-2, liau2018themolecularbasis pages 5-6). In addition, JAK1 regulation involves receptor-induced conformational changes; upon cytokine binding and receptor dimerization, autoinhibition mediated by the pseudokinase domain is relieved, allowing intermolecular trans-phosphorylation of the activation loop residues to fully activate the kinase (caveney2023structuralbasisof pages 3-5, morris2018themoleculardetails pages 31-34). Phosphatases including CD45 and SHP1 also modulate JAK1’s activity by dephosphorylating activation loop tyrosines, thereby attenuating signal propagation (morris2018themoleculardetails pages 27-31). Post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination, either as a signal for degradation or as a regulatory modification affecting kinase conformation, further contribute to the regulation of JAK1 (schiefer2024proximalproteinlandscapes pages 11-12). Collectively, these mechanisms ensure that JAK1 activity is precisely controlled in time and space, preventing aberrant activation that could lead to pathological conditions.\n\n7. Function  \nJAK1 functions as a central mediator in a broad array of cytokine signaling pathways, playing a pivotal role in immune modulation, hematopoiesis, and inflammatory responses. It is a key component in type I and type II interferon signaling (IFN-α, IFN-β, and IFN-γ), where binding of interferon to the IFNAR1-IFNAR2 receptor complex recruits JAK1, leading to the phosphorylation of IFNAR2 that creates docking sites for STAT proteins. Activated STATs subsequently dimerize and translocate to the nucleus to induce the transcription of interferon-stimulated genes, thereby orchestrating antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory responses (OpenTargets Search: -JAK1, morris2018themoleculardetails pages 31-34). In addition, JAK1 acts as a kinase partner for the IL-2 receptor and IL-10 receptor, contributing to lymphocyte development, adaptive immune responses, and maintenance of immunological tolerance (OpenTargets Search: -JAK1, gruber2020complexautoinflammatorysyndrome pages 1-3). Its activity is also critical for transactivation of other JAK kinases within receptor complexes, thereby amplifying and diversifying the downstream STAT-mediated gene expression profiles (morris2018themoleculardetails pages 14-17). JAK1’s ubiquitous expression across multiple cell types underscores its central role in diverse biological processes such as T-cell activation, regulation of hematopoietic stem cell functions, and mediation of inflammatory signals in both innate and adaptive immunity (spinelli2021jak1numberone pages 2-3, biggs2022humanjak1gain pages 1-2).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nJAK1 is a clinically significant drug target due to its central role in mediating pathogenic cytokine signaling. Several small-molecule inhibitors, including tofacitinib, ruxolitinib, baricitinib, upadacitinib, filgotinib, and abrocitinib, have been developed to target JAK1 selectively or in combination with other JAKs, and are approved or in clinical trials for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, atopic dermatitis, and various myeloproliferative disorders (biggs2022humanjak1gain pages 1-2, fayand2023successfultreatmentof pages 1-6). Mutation studies have identified gain-of-function variants in the pseudokinase domain of JAK1 that lead to severe allergic inflammation and dysregulated myelopoiesis, confirming its importance in both monogenic and polygenic immune disorders (biggs2022humanjak1gain pages 19-20, fayand2023successfultreatmentof pages 18-22). Current research continues to explore the mechanisms of receptor dimerization, trans-phosphorylation, and allosteric regulation of JAK1 through structural studies employing cryo-electron microscopy and computational modeling (caveney2023structuralbasisof pages 13-19, pogozheva2023structuralmodelingof pages 9-11). Furthermore, the interplay between JAK1 and regulatory proteins such as SOCS1 has generated interest in designing novel non–ATP competitive inhibitors that mimic endogenous inhibition, which could offer improved specificity and therapeutic index (liau2018themolecularbasis pages 1-2, liau2018themolecularbasis pages 2-3). The broad involvement of JAK1 in immune regulation also implicates it in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, making it a focal point in translational research aiming to develop targeted cytokine engineering strategies (lv2024thejakstatpathway pages 31-31, sims2020thejak1stat3socs3axis pages 2-3).\n\n9.

    "answer": "1. Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase JAK2 belongs to the Janus kinase (JAK) family, a group of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases that also includes JAK1, JAK3, and TYK2. This family is evolutionarily conserved among metazoans and plays a pivotal role in cytokine receptor signaling. JAK2 shares a conserved domain architecture with its relatives, which includes an N‐terminal FERM domain, an SH2-like domain, a pseudokinase (JH2) domain, and a catalytic kinase (JH1) domain; this arrangement is retained in orthologs across a wide range of species, from model vertebrates to humans (downes2022jak2alterationsin pages 2-4, glassman2022structureofa pages 1-3). In the kinome group, JAK2 is classified within the receptor-associated tyrosine kinases and is part of a core set of signaling proteins that mediate cytokine responses—a function so critical that its evolutionary conservation suggests an origin dating back to the last common ancestor of vertebrates (hammaren2019januskinase2 pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nJAK2 catalyzes a classic protein tyrosine kinase reaction. The reaction involves the binding of ATP to the kinase (JH1) domain of JAK2, where the γ-phosphate of ATP is transferred to the hydroxyl group of a specific tyrosine residue on a substrate protein. Physiologically, the substrates of this reaction include tyrosine residues present on the intracellular domains of cytokine receptors as well as on downstream signaling molecules such as the STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) proteins. The transfer reaction can be summarized as:  \n  ATP + protein–tyrosine → ADP + protein–phosphotyrosine  \nPhosphorylation by JAK2 is both autophosphorylating (on its own activation loop tyrosines) and trans-phosphorylating (on associated receptor chains and recruited signaling proteins), thereby triggering cascades such as the JAK/STAT pathway (downes2022jak2alterationsin pages 4-6, downes2022jak2alterationsin pages 6-7, glassman2022structureofa pages 9-11). Although detailed atomic-level reaction mechanisms remain under investigation, the fundamental catalytic process follows the conventional mechanism observed in tyrosine kinases—requiring precise alignment of the ATP γ-phosphate with the substrate’s tyrosyl hydroxyl group for effective nucleophilic attack (abraham2024molecularbasisof pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of JAK2, consistent with typical kinases, depends on divalent metal ions. In general, Mg²⁺ ions are required to coordinate with ATP in the active site, stabilizing the negative charges on the phosphate groups and facilitating the transfer of the γ-phosphate during the phosphorylation process. Although explicit experimental details for JAK2 are not exhaustively provided in every study, its reaction mechanism and structural analysis strongly indicate that Mg²⁺ is an essential cofactor (abraham2024molecularbasisof pages 11-12, glassman2022structureofa pages 4-6).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nJAK2 demonstrates substrate specificity in its phosphorylation reactions that is critical for proper signal transduction. Physiologically, its primary substrates include:  \n – Cytokine receptor intracellular domains  \n – STAT transcription factors (e.g., STAT5A, STAT5B, STAT3)  \nIn addition, reports suggest that JAK2 can phosphorylate other substrates involved in cell cycle regulation (such as CDKN1B) and even histone H3 on Tyr-41 in the nucleus, affecting chromatin structure (Information section). The enzyme recognizes substrates through a combination of sequence and structural motifs; although a simple linear consensus motif has not been universally defined, the presence of accessible tyrosine residues in a docking region near cytokine receptor Box1/Box2 motifs appears essential (downes2022jak2alterationsin pages 4-6, glassman2022structureofa pages 9-11, hammaren2019januskinase2 pages 10-11). Several studies emphasize that substrate binding is largely determined by the spatial arrangement provided by receptor dimerization—thus promoting the proximity of JAK2 to specific tyrosine clusters on the receptor tails (jin2018jakandstat pages 6-10).\n\n5. Structure  \nJAK2 is composed of multiple domains that each contribute to its overall function. Its N-terminal region contains a FERM domain that mediates binding to cytokine receptors via conserved Box1 and Box2 motifs in the receptor’s intracellular juxtamembrane region (downes2022jak2alterationsin pages 2-4, ferrao2018receptormediateddimerizationof pages 1-2). This domain is followed by an SH2-like domain, which further supports protein-protein interactions. Centrally located is the pseudokinase (JH2) domain, which lacks full catalytic activity but plays a key regulatory role by maintaining JAK2 in an autoinhibited conformation in resting cells. Importantly, mutations in the pseudokinase domain, such as the well-known V617F mutation, can disrupt this autoinhibition and lead to constitutive activation (downes2022jak2alterationsin pages 4-6, hammaren2019januskinase2 pages 1-2). The C-terminal kinase (JH1) domain houses the active site responsible for ATP binding and the ensuing phosphotransfer reaction. High-resolution structures, including those derived from cryo-electron microscopy and crystallographic studies, have revealed that upon cytokine binding and receptor dimerization, significant conformational changes occur in the kinase domain to adopt an active “DFG-in” configuration. This rearrangement properly aligns catalytic residues, such as the properly oriented glutamate in the N-lobe αC helix, to facilitate the transfer of the phosphate group (glassman2022structureofa pages 4-6, glassman2022structureofa pages 8-9). Together, the modular organization of JAK2 underpins its ability to switch between inactive and active conformations in response to external signals.\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe activity of JAK2 is tightly regulated by multiple overlapping mechanisms. Under basal conditions, the pseudokinase (JH2) domain exerts an autoinhibitory effect on the kinase domain (JH1), maintaining low levels of activity. Upon cytokine engagement of receptors such as EPOR, GHR, MPL, or LEPR, receptor dimerization brings two JAK2 molecules into proximity, enabling trans-phosphorylation of activation loop tyrosines (e.g., Tyr1007/Tyr1008) in the JH1 domain; this is a critical step in full kinase activation (downes2022jak2alterationsin pages 4-6, glassman2022structureofa pages 3-4, hammaren2019januskinase2 pages 8-10). Additionally, regulatory proteins such as suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS1 and SOCS3) and protein tyrosine phosphatases (e.g., SHP-2) actively modulate JAK2 signaling by dephosphorylating the receptor complexes or JAK2 itself, thereby terminating the signal (gorantla2025ruxolitinibmediatedparadoxical pages 2-3, hammaren2019januskinase2 pages 2-2). Moreover, small-molecule inhibitors like ruxolitinib bind competitively at the ATP-binding pocket in the active conformation of JAK2, inhibiting its catalytic function; however, paradoxically, some inhibitors can also lead to increased phosphorylation of the activation loop by protecting these residues from dephosphorylation (gorantla2025ruxolitinibmediatedparadoxical pages 2-3, vainchenker2018jakinhibitorsfor pages 6-7). Thus, JAK2 regulation is a balance between autoinhibitory intramolecular interactions, receptor-mediated dimerization and activation, and extrinsic regulatory processes mediated by phosphatases and inhibitory proteins.\n\n7. Function  \nJAK2 is a central mediator of cytokine signaling in both innate and adaptive immunity and is critical for hematopoiesis, cell growth, differentiation, and survival. In the cytoplasm, following cytokine binding to receptors—such as erythropoietin receptor (EPOR), thrombopoietin receptor (MPL/TPOR), growth hormone receptor (GHR), prolactin receptor (PRLR), and leptin receptor (LEPR)—JAK2 is activated via trans-phosphorylation and subsequently phosphorylates specific tyrosine residues on the receptor cytoplasmic domains. These phosphorylated tyrosines serve as docking sites for STAT proteins, which are then phosphorylated by JAK2, dimerize, and translocate into the nucleus to drive gene transcription programs pivotal in processes such as erythropoiesis, immune regulation, and metabolism (downes2022jak2alterationsin pages 2-4, lin2018anovelselective pages 1-2). In addition to its canonical role in the JAK/STAT pathway, JAK2 has been reported to phosphorylate nuclear substrates; for example, it specifically mediates the phosphorylation of histone H3 at Tyr-41, a modification that modulates chromatin structure through exclusion of heterochromatin protein CBX5 (HP1α), thereby influencing transcriptional regulation (Information section, abraham2024molecularbasisof pages 13-14). JAK2 also contributes to cell cycle regulation and may collaborate with other kinases like TEC in reciprocal phosphorylation events that modulate transcription factor activity (Information section). Through these diverse roles, JAK2 integrates extracellular cytokine signals with intracellular responses that govern cell proliferation, differentiation, immunity, and even metabolic pathways.\n\n8. Other Comments  \nBeyond its fundamental biological functions, aberrant JAK2 activity is implicated in several hematological disorders, including myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) and certain forms of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The most striking example is the V617F mutation in the pseudokinase domain, which leads to constitutive kinase activation and ligand-independent signaling, ultimately driving pathological proliferation (downes2022jak2alterationsin pages 4-6, hammaren2019januskinase2 pages 1-2). This constitutive activation has spurred the development of JAK inhibitors such as ruxolitinib and fedratinib, which are clinically employed to modulate JAK2 activity; however, challenges remain regarding the specificity and paradoxical regulatory effects of these inhibitors (vainchenker2018jakinhibitorsfor pages 6-7, gorantla2025ruxolitinibmediatedparadoxical pages 2-3). Furthermore, recent structural studies have illuminated the precise molecular architecture underlying JAK2 activation and regulation, presenting new opportunities for the design of allosteric modulators that might better discriminate between pathological and normal signaling states (glassman2022structureofa pages 4-6, ferrao2018receptormediateddimerizationof pages 21-21). Ongoing research is also exploring the non-canonical roles of JAK2 within the nucleus, particularly concerning chromatin modification and transcriptional regulation—a function that expands the therapeutic implications of targeting this kinase in both oncology and immune-mediated disorders (abraham2024molecularbasisof pages 13-14).\n\n9.

Phylogeny  \nTYK2 is a member of the Janus kinase (JAK) family, which comprises four closely related non‐receptor tyrosine kinases: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2. Within the diverse human kinome, TYK2 belongs to a distinct subfamily that plays an essential role in the downstream signaling of cytokine receptors. Evolutionarily, the JAK family is highly conserved across vertebrate species, and TYK2 orthologs have been identified in all mammals as well as other vertebrates. This conservation is particularly pronounced in TYK2’s catalytic (JH1) and regulatory (JH2, also called the pseudokinase) domains, which indicates that the enzyme’s dual function—both catalytic and regulatory—has been maintained since early vertebrate evolution. Studies have shown that despite the overall structural similarities shared among the JAKs, TYK2 is uniquely characterized by its ability to integrate signals from a diverse set of cytokine receptors through the formation of heterodimeric receptor complexes (bhanumathy2021proteintyrosinekinases pages 1-2, woss2019tyk2anupstream pages 3-5).  \n\nPhylogenetic reconstructions place TYK2 in a discrete cluster with its JAK counterparts; however, several sequence motifs and domain arrangements are unique to TYK2. For example, specialized regulatory elements in the JH2 domain contribute to its autoinhibition and subsequent activation when engaged by cytokine-bound receptors. Recent de‐novo functional classifications based on multi‐domain architecture and specificity–determining residues have refined our understanding of TYK2’s evolutionary context, grouping it in subfamilies that emphasize its dual role as both a modulator of receptor stability and as a catalytic enzyme (adeyelu2023kinfamsdenovoclassification pages 1-2). Moreover, the evolutionary conservation extends to the overall organization of the receptor complexes in which it participates; the TYK2-associated receptor chains (e.g., IFNAR1, IL12RB1, IL10RB, IL13RA1) and the partner kinases (JAK1 or JAK2) are themselves evolutionarily conserved, ensuring that the signal transduction machinery critical for innate and adaptive immunity is preserved. Thus, TYK2 represents an evolutionary conserved module that has been finely tuned to regulate immune responses and maintain organismal homeostasis over millions of years (bhanumathy2021proteintyrosinekinases pages 1-2, woss2019tyk2anupstream pages 3-5).\n\n## 2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nTYK2 acts as an ATP‐dependent kinase, catalyzing the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to tyrosine residues present on target proteins. The overall chemical reaction can be schematically described as:  \n  ATP + protein–Tyr → ADP + protein–phosphotyrosine + H⁺  \nThis phosphorylation event is critically important in the context of cytokine signaling. Upon cytokine binding to corresponding heterodimeric receptor complexes, TYK2 becomes activated and phosphorylates specific tyrosine residues on the intracellular domains of the receptor chains. These phosphorylated tyrosines then serve as high‐affinity docking sites for the SH2 domains of STAT transcription factors (such as STAT1, STAT3, STAT4, and STAT6) (borcherding2021tyk2incancer pages 14-16, gerstenberger2020demonstrationofin pages 2-3).  \n\nThe reaction mechanism involves several key steps. First, cytokine binding induces a conformational rearrangement within the receptor dimer, bringing the associated TYK2 molecules into close proximity. This facilitates trans‐autophosphorylation on several key tyrosine residues in the kinase domain, relieving autoinhibition imposed by the JH2 pseudokinase domain. Once activated, TYK2 phosphorylates tyrosines on the receptor intracellular domains, thus creating binding sites for STAT family members. These STAT proteins, upon recruitment, are themselves phosphorylated on a tyrosine residue, prompting homodimerization or heterodimerization that precedes their nuclear translocation and initiation of gene transcription (bhanumathy2021proteintyrosinekinases pages 1-2, gerstenberger2020demonstrationofin pages 8-9).  \n\nInterestingly, TYK2 can also mediate non-canonical phosphorylation events. In addition to the classical cascade that results in STAT activation, TYK2 phosphorylates STAT3 at an alternative tyrosine residue. This phosphorylation event does not promote its typical signaling function but rather acts as a negative regulatory mechanism, tempering STAT3’s transcriptional activity and thereby fine-tuning the overall immune response (borcherding2021tyk2incancer pages 14-16). This dual capacity—both activating and attenuating downstream signaling pathways—illustrates the sophisticated regulatory mechanisms orchestrated by TYK2 that enable precise modulation of cell signaling in response to diverse extracellular cues.\n\n## 3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of TYK2, as with most kinases, is strictly dependent on the coordinated binding of ATP and divalent metal ions. In the active site of the kinase domain, ATP binds in a cleft formed between the N-terminal and C-terminal lobes of the enzyme’s bilobal structure. Magnesium ions (Mg²⁺) are the principal cofactors required for TYK2’s enzymatic function, as they act by coordinating with the phosphate groups of ATP to facilitate the correct orientation for the gamma-phosphate transfer (abdulkhader…2023proteinkinasestructure pages 18-21, wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 21-24).  \n\nThe role of Mg²⁺ is twofold: first, it stabilizes the charge on the phosphate groups and, second, it assists in the positioning of ATP within the active site, which is essential for catalysis. Although experimental studies with other kinases occasionally indicate that Mn²⁺ can substitute under certain in vitro conditions, physiological evidence supports Mg²⁺ as the primary ion utilized by TYK2 (wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 21-24). No evidence from the context implies the requirement of any additional cofactors such as organic molecules or prosthetic groups; thus, the ATP/Mg²⁺ system constitutes the minimal cofactor requirement necessary for its catalytic function.\n\n## 4. Substrate Specificity  \nSubstrate specificity is a defining feature that enables TYK2 to coordinate complex cytokine signaling cascades with high fidelity. Physiologically, TYK2 primarily targets the intracellular domains of cytokine receptors that are part of heterodimeric complexes. Receptors such as IFNAR1, IL12RB1, IL10RB, and IL13RA1 are the preferred substrates for TYK2 phosphorylation. Upon ligand binding, these receptor chains undergo tyrosine phosphorylation by TYK2, resulting in the generation of phosphotyrosine motifs that serve as binding platforms for STAT proteins (bhanumathy2021proteintyrosinekinases pages 1-2, woss2019tyk2anupstream pages 3-5).  \n\nOnce these docking sites are established, STAT proteins—but especially STAT1, STAT3, STAT4, and STAT6—are recruited to the receptor complex. These STAT proteins contain Src homology 2 (SH2) domains that specifically recognize the phosphorylated tyrosine residues embedded in short linear motifs present in the receptor tails. The phosphorylation of the recruited STATs by TYK2 converts them from their unphosphorylated (uSTAT) to phosphorylated (pSTAT) states, leading to dimerization and subsequent nuclear translocation where they modulate gene transcription (abdulkhader…2023proteinkinasestructure pages 18-21, mingione2023allostericregulationand pages 7-9).  \n\nIn an additional layer of regulatory complexity, TYK2 selectively phosphorylates STAT3 at an alternative tyrosine site that diverges from the canonical activation site. This alternative phosphorylation event serves to negatively regulate STAT3, thereby potentially moderating excessive pro-inflammatory signals (borcherding2021tyk2incancer pages 14-16). Although a precise consensus motif for TYK2 substrates has not been fully elucidated, the substrate recognition appears to depend more on the three-dimensional context provided by receptor engagement and the spatial positioning of tyrosine residues rather than on a strictly linear amino acid sequence. This dynamic substrate recognition system ensures that TYK2 can respond appropriately to various cytokine signals while avoiding cross-activation of unrelated signaling pathways.\n\n## 5. Structure  \nThe structural architecture of TYK2 is a hallmark feature that underpins its function and regulation within the JAK-STAT pathway. TYK2 is organized into several distinct domains that each contribute to its overall activity and specificity. Starting at the N-terminus, TYK2 contains a FERM domain (comprising subdomains JH7 to JH4), which is critical for mediating the physical interaction with the intracellular portions of cytokine receptors. Adjacent to the FERM domain lies an atypical SH2-like domain (JH3), which further stabilizes receptor binding and contributes to the formation of high-affinity complexes with specific receptor chains (eshaq2024nonreceptortyrosinekinases pages 1-2, woss2019tyk2anupstream pages 3-5).  \n\nCentral to TYK2’s regulatory function is its pseudokinase domain (JH2). Although the JH2 domain lacks the full complement of catalytic residues necessary for conventional phosphotransfer, it plays an indispensable role in moderating the activity of the adjacent catalytically active kinase domain (JH1). In the autoinhibited conformation, the JH2 domain interacts closely with the JH1 kinase domain to restrict ATP access and substrate binding, effectively maintaining TYK2 in an inactive state until proper receptor engagement triggers conformational changes (tomoni2019pseudokinasesfromallosteric pages 10-13, wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 24-32).  \n\nThe C-terminal JH1 domain of TYK2 displays the canonical bilobal kinase fold, with a smaller, mostly β-strand–rich N-terminal lobe and a larger, predominantly α-helical C-terminal lobe. The ATP-binding cleft is situated in the interface between these lobes and is characterized by conserved motifs that are essential for catalysis. Key among these are the glycine-rich loop (P-loop), which assists in the proper positioning of ATP, the HRD (His-Arg-Asp) motif within the catalytic loop that is critical for proton transfer and residue positioning, and the DFG (Asp-Phe-Gly) motif, which coordinates the binding of Mg²⁺ ions necessary for catalysis (abdulkhader…2023proteinkinasestructure pages 18-21, mingione2023allostericregulationand pages 7-9).  \n\nWithin the JH1 domain, a conserved lysine residue is responsible for stabilizing the phosphates of ATP, while a glutamate from the αC helix reinforces the active conformation of the enzyme. Structural studies have revealed that the interplay between the JH2 and JH1 domains is not static; rather, TYK2 alternates between autoinhibited states and fully active conformations. Recent crystal structures and advanced homology models demonstrate that receptor engagement induces domain rotations and conformational “breathing” motions that free the active site of the kinase domain for substrate phosphorylation (wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 17-21, majeski2020theroleof pages 35-39).  \n\nIn summary, TYK2’s structure is defined by a modular design that includes receptor-binding domains (FERM and SH2), a regulatory pseudokinase domain (JH2) that governs autoinhibition, and a catalytic kinase domain (JH1) that executes phosphorylation reactions. This intricate architecture not only ensures precise regulation of its kinase activity but also provides multiple opportunities for selective inhibitor design, as evidenced by the development of compounds that target the JH2 domain allosterically.\n\n## 6. Regulation  \nThe activity of TYK2 is regulated by multiple overlapping mechanisms that integrate extracellular cytokine signals with intracellular control processes. Central to this regulation is the autoinhibitory role of the JH2 pseudokinase domain, which interacts with the JH1 kinase domain to keep the enzyme in an inactive conformation under basal conditions. In the absence of cytokine stimulation, this interaction minimizes unwanted autophosphorylation and prevents spurious signaling events (eshaq2024nonreceptortyrosinekinases pages 1-2, tomoni2019pseudokinasesfromallosteric pages 10-13).  \n\nUpon cytokine binding to the heterodimeric receptor complexes, significant conformational rearrangements occur. The receptor dimerization brings TYK2 into close proximity with partner JAKs such as JAK1 or JAK2, thereby facilitating trans-autophosphorylation. This phosphorylation typically occurs on multiple tyrosine residues within the JH1 activation loop and in other regulatory regions, leading to the release of the autoinhibition imposed by the JH2 domain (wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 1-5, kim2024tyk2regulatestau pages 16-22). These phosphorylation events not only enhance the catalytic efficiency of TYK2 but also create additional docking sites for STAT proteins, effectively propagating the cytokine signal.\n\nIn addition to receptor-induced activation, TYK2 is subject to further regulation by post-translational modifications. Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) can dephosphorylate key tyrosine residues, thereby attenuating signaling once the cytokine stimulus is removed. Also, regulators such as suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins bind phosphorylated tyrosine residues and target TYK2 for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation (borcherding2021tyk2incancer pages 14-16, raivolaUnknownyearmolecularregulationof pages 105-107).  \n\nA notable regulatory mechanism is the action of allosteric inhibitors that selectively target the TYK2 JH2 domain. One prominent example is deucravacitinib, which binds to the pseudokinase region with subnanomolar affinity (approximately IC50 ~0.2 nM) and locks TYK2 in its autoinhibited conformation. Deucravacitinib prevents the conformational changes required for ATP binding and for the kinase domain to adopt an active state, thereby effectively reducing both autophosphorylation and downstream STAT activation. This allosteric mode of inhibition offers enhanced selectivity compared to inhibitors that target the more conserved ATP-binding pocket, thereby minimizing off-target effects commonly observed with pan-JAK inhibitors (dalle2024targetingproteinkinases pages 3-5, rusinol2023tyk2targetingin pages 15-16).  \n\nMoreover, the coordinated effects of receptor binding, phosphorylation, and negative regulatory proteins ensure that TYK2 activity is precisely modulated. This multifaceted regulation is critical: it enables robust signaling in the presence of cytokines while preventing excessive or prolonged activation that could lead to pathological inflammation.\n\n## 7. Function  \nTYK2 is a central node in the transmission of cytokine- and interferon-induced signals, making it indispensable for normal immune function and cellular homeostasis. Functionally, TYK2 is involved in both the initiation and modulation of signaling cascades that control cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and migration. It associates with heterodimeric cytokine receptor complexes that contain a partner receptor chain (such as IFNAR1, IL12RB1, IL10RB, or IL13RA1) and an accompanying JAK family member (typically JAK1 or JAK2). Upon cytokine engagement, TYK2 phosphorylates these receptor subunits, thereby generating docking sites for STAT transcription factors. The recruited STAT proteins, once phosphorylated by TYK2, dimerize and translocate to the nucleus where they regulate the expression of genes involved in critical immune responses (bhanumathy2021proteintyrosinekinases pages 1-2, castelosoccio2023proteinkinasesdrug pages 1-2).  \n\nThe functional versatility of TYK2 is further highlighted by its ability to engage in both positive and negative regulation of downstream signaling. For example, while phosphorylation typically results in the activation of STAT proteins, TYK2 also phosphorylates STAT3 at an alternative tyrosine residue that serves to temper its activity. This regulatory switch is thought to be essential for maintaining a balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory signals, thereby safeguarding against runaway immune responses that could lead to autoimmunity (borcherding2021tyk2incancer pages 14-16, muromoto2022currentunderstandingof pages 1-2).  \n\nTYK2’s biological functions extend to antiviral defense; through its role in type I interferon signaling, TYK2 helps mediate the rapid induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that are crucial for establishing an antiviral state. In addition to its role in innate immunity, TYK2 also influences the adaptive immune system by modulating T cell differentiation. For instance, signaling via the IL-12 receptor, which involves TYK2, is integral to the differentiation of CD4⁺ T cells into Th1 subsets, while IL-23 signaling—also dependent on TYK2—promotes the formation and maintenance of Th17 cells, both of which are central to the immune response against intracellular pathogens as well as in autoimmune inflammation (abdulkhader…2023proteinkinasestructure pages 18-21, woss2019tyk2anupstream pages 3-5).  \n\nDysregulation of TYK2, whether through aberrant expression or mutations that affect its kinase activity, has been linked to a range of clinical disorders. Both hyperactive and deficient TYK2 signaling have been implicated in autoimmune diseases and inflammatory disorders, as well as in certain cancers where altered cytokine signaling contributes to tumor progression and immune evasion. As such, TYK2 is not only a central mediator in physiological signaling pathways but also represents a critical therapeutic target, with its activity serving as both a biomarker of disease and as a controllable element in targeted drug interventions.\n\n## 8. Other Comments  \nThe clinical and therapeutic significance of TYK2 has catalyzed the development of numerous inhibitors, which are being actively evaluated for their efficacy and safety in treating a variety of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs). Recent advances in drug discovery have yielded highly selective allosteric inhibitors like deucravacitinib, which target the regulatory JH2 pseudokinase domain rather than the conserved ATP-binding site. This strategy not only enhances selectivity by exploiting subtle structural differences between TYK2 and other JAK family members but also mitigates the off-target toxicities frequently observed with less selective pan-JAK inhibitors (dalle2024targetingproteinkinases pages 3-5, rusinol2023tyk2targetingin pages 15-16).\n\nMutations in the TYK2 gene have also attracted considerable research interest due to their association with several pathological conditions. Both gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations have been documented, with the former potentially leading to hyperactive signaling that may contribute to pathological inflammation or oncogenesis, and the latter predisposing individuals to immunodeficiency syndromes. Specific mutations that affect the structural integrity of the pseudokinase domain can disrupt the delicate balance of autoinhibition, thereby altering kinase activity and influencing STAT-driven transcriptional programs (tomoni2019pseudokinasesfromallosteric pages 10-13, wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 1-5).\n\nBeyond its role in classic cytokine signaling, TYK2 is increasingly being explored as a biomarker for disease prognosis in oncology. Aberrant expression or constitutive activation of TYK2 has been identified in several cancers, where it can impact tumor progression and the efficacy of immune surveillance mechanisms. In these contexts, targeting TYK2 may prove beneficial not only in reducing tumor cell proliferation and survival but also in modulating the tumor microenvironment to enhance anti-tumor immunity (woss2019tyk2anupstream pages 3-5, mingione2023allostericregulationand pages 7-9).\n\nOngoing research efforts are also focused on elucidating the full spectrum of TYK2’s interactions with other signaling molecules and identifying additional layers of regulation. Structural dynamics studies, including high-resolution crystallography and advanced molecular modeling, continue to provide new insights into the conformational states of TYK2. These insights are critical for the rational design of next-generation inhibitors that can achieve optimal efficacy while minimizing adverse effects. The interplay between TYK2’s catalytic activity, its regulatory domains, and its multiple protein-protein interactions remains a vibrant area of investigation that is likely to yield further therapeutic innovations in the near future.\n\n## 9.

    "answer": "1. Phylogeny  \nSerine/threonine‐protein kinase tousled‐like 1 (TLK1), also known as PKU‑beta, is a member of the Tousled‐like kinase family that is evolutionarily conserved from plants to humans. The mammalian TLK family comprises at least two paralogs (TLK1 and TLK2) that share high sequence conservation in their catalytic domains (approximately 94% identity between TLK isoforms) and overall similarity in regulatory regions, including coiled‑coil motifs that are critical for dimerization and oligomerization (segurabayona2019thetousledlikekinases pages 1-3, paya2021thetousledlikekinases pages 37-40). Orthologs of TLK1 can be identified in higher eukaryotes such as Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and Arabidopsis thaliana – where the founder Tousled (TSL) was originally discovered – but are absent in yeast, indicating an evolutionary emergence that correlates with increasing complexity in chromatin regulation and developmental processes (ehsan2020molecularbasisand pages 1-3, segurabayona2019thetousledlikekinases pages 1-3).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nTLK1 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to specific serine/threonine residues on its substrate proteins. The general reaction follows the biochemical equation: ATP + protein (with target serine/threonine residue) → ADP + protein‑O‑phosphate + H⁺. Experimentally, TLK1 has been shown in vitro to phosphorylate histone H3 specifically at serine‑10, a modification implicated in chromatin dynamics during DNA replication and repair (Information, provided). In addition, one particular isoform (isoform 3) phosphorylates the t‑SNARE SNAP23, thereby enhancing its stability and promoting its assembly with syntaxin, which is a key event in membrane trafficking pathways that also contribute to the cellular response to ionizing radiation (Information, provided).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nLike many serine/threonine kinases, TLK1 requires divalent metal ions for its catalytic activity. Although explicit experimental details on TLK1 cofactors are sparse in the provided context, it is highly likely that TLK1 depends on Mg²⁺ ions to facilitate ATP binding and subsequent phosphoryl transfer, as observed with related kinases in the kinase superfamily (mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 1-2, segurabayona2019thetousledlikekinases pages 1-3).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nTLK1 exhibits substrate specificity tightly linked to its role in DNA replication and chromatin assembly. Well‐characterized substrates include histone H3 and components of the chromatin assembly machinery. In vitro studies have demonstrated that TLK1 can phosphorylate histone H3 at serine‑10, a modification that may contribute to nucleosome assembly and chromatin dynamics during S‑phase (Information, provided). Furthermore, TLK1 indirectly impacts chromatin assembly by phosphorylating substrates involved in histone chaperone stabilization, such as ASF1 in its related functions shared with TLK2, even though direct evidence in TLK1 is less extensive than for TLK2 (ehsan2020molecularbasisand pages 1-3, segurabayona2019thetousledlikekinases pages 3-4). An isoform‑specific substrate is the t‑SNARE SNAP23, where phosphorylation by TLK1 isoform 3 enhances SNAP23 stability and its assembly with syntaxin, thus contributing to cellular protection against ionizing radiation (Information, provided).\n\n5. Structure  \nTLK1 is composed of a modular domain architecture typical of many serine/threonine kinases. It contains an N‑terminal regulatory region that includes nuclear localization signals (NLS) and predicted coiled‑coil domains crucial for protein–protein interaction and oligomerization. The central portion features a catalytic kinase domain that is highly conserved and harbors the key motifs required for ATP binding and phosphotransferase activity. The C‑terminal region may include additional regulatory elements and phosphorylation sites that modulate kinase activity. Structural analyses using approaches analogous to those applied to TLK2 have revealed that the coiled‑coil motifs are essential for dimerization and are thought to influence substrate recognition and overall enzymatic regulation (segurabayona2019thetousledlikekinases pages 3-4, paya2021thetousledlikekinases pages 40-44). Although no high‑resolution crystal structure is provided here specifically for TLK1, structural models based on homology with TLK2 support a similar overall three-dimensional organization with a central catalytic domain flanked by disordered regulatory segments.\n\n6. Regulation  \nTLK1 activity is tightly regulated in a cell cycle–dependent manner. Under normal S‑phase conditions, TLK1 is active and contributes to chromatin assembly during DNA replication. However, upon the generation of DNA double‑stranded breaks, TLK1 is rapidly and transiently inhibited by phosphorylation in a checkpoint–dependent manner. This inhibition is mediated through ATM‑pathway components and is dependent on the activation of checkpoint kinases such as CHK1, which phosphorylate TLK1 (for example, at residues analogous to the reported Ser‑695 in related studies) to transiently abrogate its kinase activity (ronald2013phenothiazineinhibitorsof pages 10-11, segurabayona2019thetousledlikekinases pages 7-8). This regulatory mechanism facilitates the appropriate response to DNA damage by pausing chromatin assembly and allowing repair processes to take precedence. Once DNA repair is underway or completed, TLK1 activity is restored, thereby promoting the resumption of normal cell cycle progression and chromatin reassembly. Additionally, the existence of distinct isoforms (with isoform 3 showing unique substrate preference for SNAP23) indicates that alternative splicing may contribute to differential regulation of TLK1 function in various cellular contexts (Information, provided).\n\n7. Function  \nTLK1 plays a critical role in the maintenance of genomic and epigenomic stability, primarily through its involvement in DNA replication and the repair of DNA double‑strand breaks. Under unstressed conditions during S‑phase, TLK1 facilitates chromatin assembly by phosphorylating histone proteins and modulating histone chaperones, which ensures efficient nucleosome reassembly and replication fork stability (ehsan2020molecularbasisand pages 1-3, segurabayona2019thetousledlikekinases pages 1-3). In response to genotoxic stress, such as ionizing radiation, TLK1 isoform 3 phosphorylates SNAP23, thereby enhancing its stability and promoting assembly with syntaxin; this activity contributes to efficient double‑strand break repair and enhances cellular radioresistance (Information, provided, sunavala‐dossabhoy2018preservingsalivarygland pages 6-7). TLK1 is also implicated in cell cycle checkpoint recovery, as its transient inhibition following DNA damage is essential to coordinate the repair processes before cells resume proliferation (ghosh2023untouslingtherole pages 1-2, segurabayona2019thetousledlikekinases pages 7-8). Furthermore, TLK1’s role in chromatin assembly links it to the modulation of transcription, DNA replication fidelity, and, by extension, cellular responses involved in tumorigenesis and neurodevelopment, with emerging evidence associating TLK1 variants with neurodevelopmental disorders and immunodeficiency (sanchizcalvo2024denovotlk1 pages 2-4, nuhusoso2025neuronaldifferentiationenhances pages 1-4).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nRecent genetic studies have identified de novo mutations in TLK1 in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders and immunodeficiency, suggesting that alterations in TLK1 function can have profound developmental and immunological consequences (sanchizcalvo2024denovotlk1 pages 2-4, sanchizcalvo2024denovotlk1a pages 2-4). In the context of cancer, although much of the research has focused on TLK2, TLK1 shares redundant roles in maintaining genome integrity, and its dysregulation may contribute to genomic instability and radioresistance in tumor cells (ghosh2023untouslingtherole pages 7-8, ibrahim2020knockdownoftousled‑like pages 8-10). Small molecule inhibitors targeting the Tousled‑like kinases have been developed with an emphasis on narrow spectrum inhibition and structure‑activity relationship optimization; while these inhibitors were primarily characterized for TLK2, similar strategies may yield compounds effective against TLK1 as well (asquith2024discoveryandoptimization pages 45-46, ronald2013phenothiazineinhibitorsof pages 10-11). Investigation into TLK1 inhibitors is of significant interest given their potential to sensitize cancer cells to DNA‑damaging chemotherapeutics and radiomimetic agents. Overall, TLK1 remains an active area of research, particularly regarding its role in chromatin dynamics during DNA replication, its regulatory control in the DNA damage response, and its emerging links to neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\n9.

    "answer": "1. Phylogeny  \nTLK2 is a highly conserved serine/threonine protein kinase that, together with its close paralog TLK1, belongs to the Tousled‐like kinase (TLK) family. Mammalian TLK2 is evolutionarily related to the original Tousled (TSL) kinase first discovered in Arabidopsis thaliana, and its orthologs have been identified in diverse eukaryotic species including invertebrates such as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, as well as in mammals and plants (bayona2018roleofthe pages 40-42, segurabayona2019thetousledlikekinases pages 1-3). TLK2 and TLK1 share high sequence similarity in their catalytic domains—up to 94% identity—and overall about 80–84% identity, indicating that they arise from a relatively recent gene duplication event in vertebrate evolution and are part of an evolutionarily ancient set of cell cycle regulators required for chromatin dynamics (buron2014theroleof pages 43-48, segurabayona2019thetousledlikekinases pages 3-4). Furthermore, the typical domain architecture, featuring coiled-coil motifs and a conserved kinase domain, emphasizes that TLK2 is embedded within a core network of eukaryotic kinases that regulate DNA replication and repair, with evolutionary relationships that trace back to the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) (buron2014theroleof pages 127-131).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nTLK2 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to specific serine or threonine residues on target proteins. In this canonical kinase reaction, ATP and the substrate protein (usually one with serine/threonine acceptor sites) are converted into ADP and a phosphorylated protein along with the release of a proton (asquith2024discoveryandoptimization pages 1-3). The best‐characterized substrates for TLK2 are the histone chaperones ASF1A and ASF1B, which upon phosphorylation become stabilized and better able to facilitate nucleosome assembly during DNA replication and repair processes (asquith2024discoveryandoptimization pages 1-3, bayona2018roleofthe pages 42-52).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of TLK2 is dependent on the presence of ATP as the phosphate donor, and like many protein kinases, it requires divalent metal ions—most notably Mg2+—to coordinate ATP binding and facilitate the phosphoryl transfer reaction (mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 1-2). Although specific studies detailing additional cofactors or regulatory molecules are limited in the provided context, the typical kinase mechanism implies a requirement for Mg2+ and related ions to maintain the structure of the ATP binding pocket and stabilize the transition state during catalysis (bayona2018roleofthe pages 92-94).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nTLK2 exhibits substrate specificity primarily for serine/threonine residues in proteins associated with chromatin structure. Its best‐characterized substrates are the histone chaperones ASF1A and ASF1B, which play pivotal roles in histone deposition during DNA replication. Phosphorylation of ASF1 by TLK2 prevents its degradation via the proteasome and thereby enhances chromatin assembly (asquith2024discoveryandoptimization pages 1-3). Although the exact consensus sequence for TLK2 phosphorylation is not strictly rigid, experimental data from peptide array studies suggest that TLK2 may prefer substrates featuring acidic residues adjacent to the phosphorylation site, though this appears to be a component of a complex substrate recognition pattern that may also involve higher order structural determinants (buron2014theroleof pages 127-131, bayona2018roleofthe pages 96-101). Additional substrates proposed include proteins involved in DNA damage response such as RAD9 and potentially other proteins that contribute to replication fork stability. However, the strongest supporting evidence points to ASF1 as the canonical substrate whose phosphorylation is functionally linked to chromatin assembly and genome stability (segurabayona2019thetousledlikekinases pages 4-5, mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 10-11).\n\n5. Structure  \nTLK2 displays a modular architecture consisting of an N-terminal regulatory region and a C-terminal catalytic kinase domain. The N-terminal portion is largely disordered but harbors multiple coiled-coil motifs, which are critical for dimerization and oligomerization. These coiled-coil domains, especially the first coiled-coil (CC1), not only facilitate homo- and hetero-dimer formation with TLK1 but also contribute to the regulation of substrate access (bayona2018roleofthe pages 40-42, segurabayona2019thetousledlikekinases pages 3-4). The catalytic domain exhibits the conserved bilobal fold common to protein kinases, with an ATP binding pocket that shows key interactions with inhibitors such as oxindole derivatives; structural studies using X-ray crystallography have resolved the TLK2 kinase domain bound to ATP analogs, revealing distinct features such as deviations in the P-loop motif and extended activation segments (mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 9-9, asquith2024discoveryandoptimization pages 9-11). Unique among many kinases is that while TLK2 undergoes autophosphorylation at multiple serine/threonine sites within both the N- and C-lobes, certain phosphorylation events—such as on S617, S686, and T695—are crucial for modulating its catalytic efficiency and structural stability; mutations at these residues have been shown to either inhibit or stabilize its activity (mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 92-94, bayona2018roleofthe pages 90-92). In addition, TLK2 contains a C-terminal tail that may serve as a negative regulator of enzymatic activity in a fashion reminiscent of its paralog TLK1 (buron2014theroleof pages 122-127).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of TLK2 is multifaceted, involving autophosphorylation, dimerization, and response to DNA damage. Autophosphorylation plays a central role in TLK2 activation, with distinct cis- and trans-phosphorylation events occurring within dimeric complexes that sequentially enhance its catalytic competence. For instance, phosphorylation on residues such as S617 immediately following the conserved DFG motif can inhibit activity when mimicked by negative charge, suggesting a finely tuned regulatory mechanism (mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 90-92, bayona2018roleofthe pages 94-96). In addition to autophosphorylation, TLK2 is subject to regulation by checkpoint kinases; phosphorylation by CHK1 has been implicated in regulating the activity of TLK1, and similar mechanisms are proposed for TLK2 in the context of DNA damage responses (bayona2018roleofthe pages 178-188, segurabayona2019thetousledlikekinases pages 5-7). The oligomerization mediated by the N-terminal coiled-coil domains is also critical for its activation, as TLK2 functions optimally in a dimeric state that favors inter-molecular phosphorylation (mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 11-13, bayona2018roleofthe pages 78-85). Furthermore, interactions with other proteins—such as the dynein light chain LC8 (DYNLL1)—can modulate its assembly and possibly fine-tune its substrate recognition; however, LC8 is not a direct phosphorylation substrate but rather serves as a multimerization hub (bayona2018roleofthe pages 160-167, segurabayona2019thetousledlikekinases pages 4-5). Regulation by environmental cues is evident in TLK2’s response to DNA damage and replication stress, where its activity is rapidly attenuated to allow proper checkpoint activation and repair, thereby linking its kinase function to the broader cellular DNA damage response (asquith2024discoveryandoptimization pages 45-46, segurabayona2019thetousledlikekinases pages 5-7).\n\n7. Function  \nTLK2 plays a pivotal role in maintaining genome and epigenome stability through its regulation of chromatin dynamics during DNA replication, repair, transcription, and chromosome segregation. The kinase phosphorylates the histone chaperones ASF1A and ASF1B, thereby stabilizing these proteins and promoting efficient chromatin assembly by ensuring a sufficient supply of histones H3 and H4 during DNA replication (asquith2024discoveryandoptimization pages 1-3, bayona2018roleofthe pages 40-42). In doing so, TLK2 prevents the accumulation of single-stranded DNA, replication fork stalling, and subsequent DNA damage (mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 3-4). Additionally, TLK2 has been implicated in the resolution of the G2/M checkpoint following DNA damage, with its activity ensuring timely recovery and progression into mitosis; this function has critical implications for genome integrity and cell cycle fidelity (segurabayona2019thetousledlikekinases pages 5-7, bayona2018roleofthe pages 178-188). Beyond its classical role in chromatin assembly, TLK2 is reported to act as a negative regulator of amino acid starvation-induced autophagy, thus linking its kinase activity to metabolic homeostasis (asquith2024discoveryandoptimization pages 1-3). The expression of TLK2 is ubiquitous, and although it predominantly localizes in the nucleus, splice variants and regulated nuclear export have been noted especially in differentiated neuronal cells, suggesting additional roles in cell differentiation and neuronal function (nuhusoso2025neuronaldifferentiationenhances pages 1-4). Furthermore, genetic studies have associated TLK2 mutations or altered expression with neurodevelopmental disorders—including autosomal dominant intellectual disability—and with oncogenic processes, particularly in cancers where TLK2 gene amplification correlates with poor clinical outcomes (OpenTargets Search: -TLK2, segurabayona2019thetousledlikekinases pages 9-10).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nTLK2 is emerging as an attractive therapeutic target owing to its central role in genome stability and its implication in disease contexts ranging from cancer to neurodevelopmental disorders. Recent medicinal chemistry efforts, for example through the use of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR), have led to the development of narrow spectrum inhibitors that target the ATP-binding pocket of TLK2, with oxindole-based compounds demonstrating potent activity and selectivity (asquith2024discoveryandoptimization pages 9-11, bayona2018roleofthe pages 54-56). These inhibitors take advantage of key interactions within the kinase domain—specifically with hinge-region residues—and have been characterized using kinome-wide selectivity profiling to confirm their narrow spectrum of inhibition (asquith2024discoveryandoptimization pages 9-11). In addition, TLK2’s regulation by protein–protein interactions (for example, its association with LC8 and its heteromerization with TLK1) and post-translational modifications provides multiple potential strategies for modulation. Genetic evidence also supports the involvement of TLK2 in conditions such as autosomal dominant intellectual disability and neurodevelopmental syndromes, making it a focal point for both basic research and drug discovery programs (OpenTargets Search: -TLK2, buron2014theroleof pages 131-138). Despite these advances, challenges remain, including the need for more-specific inhibitors and a deeper understanding of TLK2’s substrate recognition and regulation in different cellular contexts. Ongoing research continues to integrate structural biology, chemical genetics, and cell biology approaches to develop effective therapeutic strategies that target TLK2 (mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 13-13, segurabayona2019thetousledlikekinases pages 12-13).\n\n9.

    "answer": "## 1. Phylogeny  \nLIM domain kinase 1 (LIMK1) belongs to a small family of kinases that share a conserved domain architecture and regulatory mechanisms, with LIMK2 as its closest paralog; overall, LIMK1 and LIMK2 share approximately 50% amino acid identity, with even higher conservation (around 70%) in their catalytic kinase domain (brion2021limkinasesin pages 1-2, chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 1-3). This protein is identifiable in all mammalian species and is conserved in other vertebrates, reflecting its emergence evolutionarily alongside increased cellular complexity and specialized cytoskeletal regulation in multicellular organisms. In contrast to simpler eukaryotes – where homologous actin regulatory kinases are either absent or extremely divergent – LIMK1 appears only in organisms that require intensive control over actin dynamics during developmental processes, neuronal morphogenesis, and other complex cellular functions (fraboulet2022theroleof pages 1-2). Phylogenetically, LIMK1 is classified as a serine/threonine kinase that, despite some historical misclassification owing to its name, consistently functions downstream of Rho family GTPases, acting as a key integrator of signals that control cytoskeletal architecture (brion2021limkinasesin pages 1-2, chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 8-10). Orthologs have been detected in numerous vertebrate genomes, and while invertebrates such as Drosophila demonstrate proteins with limited similarity in sequence, the complete domain organization found in vertebrate LIMK1 – consisting of tandem LIM domains, a PDZ domain, and a C-terminal kinase domain – underlines a conserved evolutionary trajectory (fraboulet2022theroleof pages 13-15). This conservation indicates that the regulatory functions required for precise actin filament control were essential during the evolution of complex tissues such as the brain and muscle, where rapid and regulated cytoskeletal remodeling is essential (brion2021limkinasesin pages 1-2).\n\n## 2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nLIMK1 mediates a highly specific phosphorylation reaction that is ATP-dependent. The enzyme transfers the γ-phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine (and in some contexts, threonine) residues present on its substrate proteins (brion2021limkinasesin pages 1-2, chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 3-4). The core reaction catalyzed by LIMK1 involves the phosphorylation and consequent inactivation of actin depolymerizing factors. Its best characterized substrates are members of the cofilin family—specifically, cofilin-1 (CFL1), cofilin-2 (CFL2), and destrin (DSTN)—which normally promote actin filament severing and depolymerization (coumans2018cofilinandprofilin pages 2-4, chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 3-4). Phosphorylation occurs predominantly at the serine 3 residue of cofilin, a modification that disrupts its actin-binding activity, thereby leading to the stabilization and accumulation of filamentous actin (F-actin) throughout the cell (brion2021limkinasesin pages 1-2, chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 8-10). In addition, LIMK1 phosphorylates tubulin polymerization-promoting protein (TPPP) on its serine residues, which results in microtubule disassembly and further connects LIMK1’s role to the regulation of two major cytoskeletal systems (brion2021limkinasesin pages 1-2, chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 8-10). The complete catalytic reaction can be summarized as:  \n ATP + [protein]–OH → ADP + [protein]–O‑phosphate + H⁺  \nwhere the substrate is typically an actin-binding protein such as cofilin, and the phosphate group addition irreversibly alters the protein’s conformation and function (chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 3-4). This biochemical modification is crucial for controlling the dynamic behavior of actin filaments, affecting cell shape, motility, and cell cycle progression (brion2021limkinasesin pages 1-2).\n\n## 3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of LIMK1, consistent with most serine/threonine kinases, is dependent on the presence of ATP as the phosphate donor and a divalent metal ion to coordinate the catalytic reaction. Among the metal ions, Mg²⁺ is typically essential, serving to stabilize the negative charges on ATP and properly orient it in the active site for effective phosphotransfer (brion2021limkinasesin pages 1-2, chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 3-4). Although the provided literature does not elaborate extensively on alternate metal ions, the requirement for Mg²⁺ is a well-established hallmark common to the vast majority of kinases. No evidence in the current context indicates the need for any non-metal cofactors or unusual regulatory molecules beyond the standard requirement of ATP and Mg²⁺ (brion2021limkinasesin pages 1-2). This cofactor dependency is critical to orchestrate the proper catalytic geometry in the enzyme’s active center, ensuring high fidelity during phosphate group transfer (chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 3-4).\n\n## 4. Substrate Specificity  \nLIMK1 demonstrates a high degree of substrate specificity toward proteins that regulate actin filament dynamics. Its physiological substrates include members of the cofilin family—namely, cofilin-1, cofilin-2, and destrin—which are centrally involved in actin depolymerization and filament turnover (brion2021limkinasesin pages 1-2, coumans2018cofilinandprofilin pages 2-4). The phosphorylation of cofilin at its serine 3 residue by LIMK1 inactivates the actin-binding and severing functions of these proteins, effectively stabilizing F-actin structures and altering cellular dynamics (brion2021limkinasesin pages 1-2, chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 8-10). In terms of substrate recognition, LIMK1 does not appear to rely on a simple linear consensus sequence; instead, it appears that substrate specificity is conferred partly by tertiary interactions. Structural studies have described a “rock-and-poke” mechanism in which substrates such as CFL1 dock via an anchor helix that binds a specific interface on the kinase outside the immediate vicinity of the catalytic catalytic cleft (chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 4-6, chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 6-8). This docking mechanism allows the target serine residue (e.g., Ser3 of cofilin) to be optimally aligned for efficient phosphorylation. Further, LIMK1 also phosphorylates TPPP, a microtubule-associated protein, indicating its substrate repertoire extends beyond just actin regulatory proteins (brion2021limkinasesin pages 1-2). While no strict consensus motif has been defined in the provided sources, the requirement for an accessible serine residue, along with the presence of specific docking features, appears to be key in substrate recognition (chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 4-6).\n\n## 5. Structure  \nLIMK1 is a modular protein that is characterized by a distinct domain architecture essential for its regulatory functions and catalytic activity. At the extreme amino terminus, LIMK1 contains two LIM domains; these domains are zinc-binding motifs that consist of tandem zinc fingers stabilized by conserved cysteine and histidine residues (brion2021limkinasesin pages 1-2, estevez2016signalingmechanismsof pages 76-81). The LIM domains are primarily involved in mediating protein–protein interactions and are implicated in both dimerization and intramolecular auto-inhibition by engaging with the kinase domain. Following the LIM domains is a PDZ domain, which is thought to contribute to the trafficking of LIMK1 between the cytoplasm and nucleus, and may facilitate the assembly of signaling complexes (estevez2016signalingmechanismsof pages 76-81, fraboulet2022theroleof pages 1-2). A serine/proline-rich region is located immediately downstream of the PDZ domain; this segment likely serves as a flexible linker that permits independent movement and regulatory interactions among the structured domains (estevez2016signalingmechanismsofa pages 76-81). The carboxy-terminal portion of LIMK1 encompasses its catalytic kinase domain. This highly conserved domain contains several structural motifs hallmark to serine/threonine kinases, including the glycine-rich loop, which helps to coordinate ATP binding, a VAIK motif that forms critical interactions with the nucleotide, and an HRDL motif that is part of the catalytic loop (chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 3-4, chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 8-10). In the activation loop of the kinase domain, LIMK1 features a regulatory threonine (Thr508) whose phosphorylation is crucial for activation; this modification stabilizes the enzyme in an active, “DFG-in” conformation, while the DFG motif itself can switch between active and inactive structural arrangements (chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 11-12). An intriguing and unique property observed in structural studies is the “rock-and-poke” mechanism for substrate recognition, where the substrate’s docking helix interacts with a region on LIMK1 that is distinct from the catalytic cleft, thus permitting a dynamic “rocking” movement into the active site for phosphorylation (chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 4-6, chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 6-8). Crystal structures and predictive AlphaFold models have consistently confirmed this modular organization and have provided insights into the dynamic interplay between the regulatory LIM and PDZ domains and the kinase domain (chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 10-11, estevez2016signalingmechanismsof pages 76-81). These structural features collectively enable LIMK1 to integrate multiple signaling inputs and to modulate its catalytic output with high specificity.\n\n## 6. Regulation  \nThe activity of LIMK1 is governed by a complex network of regulatory mechanisms that include both phosphorylation events and domain-mediated intramolecular interactions. A central regulatory mechanism involves the phosphorylation of a conserved threonine residue within the activation loop of the kinase domain (Thr508 in LIMK1), which is carried out by various upstream kinases such as ROCK1, PAK1, and PAK4 (brion2021limkinasesin pages 1-2, chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 3-4). This phosphorylation event stabilizes the active conformation of the enzyme by forming a salt bridge with nearby basic residues, thereby preventing the DFG motif from flipping into an inactive “DFG-out” state (chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 11-12). Additionally, LIMK1 regulation is further modulated via autoinhibition mediated by its regulatory domains; the N-terminal LIM domains, for example, can maintain the kinase in a relatively inactive state by forming intramolecular contacts with the kinase domain, and deletion or mutation of these LIM domains leads to an increase in basal kinase activity (estevez2016signalingmechanismsof pages 76-81, fraboulet2022theroleof pages 1-2). The PDZ domain also plays a role in subcellular localization, as proper nucleocytoplasmic trafficking is essential for LIMK1 to properly access its substrates, and mutations in the PDZ domain’s nuclear export signals can alter this balance (estevez2016signalingmechanismsof pages 76-81). \n\nPhosphatases, particularly those belonging to the slingshot (SSH) family, counteract the action of LIMK1 by dephosphorylating its substrates – for instance, removing the phosphate group from cofilin, thus restoring cofilin’s actin severing activity and allowing dynamic turnover of the actin cytoskeleton (coumans2018cofilinandprofilin pages 2-4, fraboulet2022theroleof pages 17-17). In addition to these enzyme-driven modifications, dimerization mediated by the LIM domains is thought to modulate LIMK1’s stability and substrate recognition capacity. Experimental evidence suggests that homo- or heterodimer formation via these domains can either enhance or inhibit the catalytic activity depending on the precise structural arrangement, thereby adding an additional layer of regulation (fraboulet2022theroleof pages 13-15, chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 4-6). Collectively, these mechanisms ensure that LIMK1 activity is tightly tuned in response to both upstream signaling events and local cellular conditions, thereby regulating the balance between actin filament stabilization and turnover in various physiological contexts.\n\n## 7. Function  \nLIMK1 is a central effector in the regulation of actin filament dynamics and thus plays a pivotal role in numerous cellular processes. By phosphorylating cofilin-1, cofilin-2, and destrin at serine residues (predominantly at Ser3), LIMK1 inactivates these actin-depolymerizing factors, thereby preventing the severing of filamentous actin; the net result is the stabilization and accumulation of F-actin within the cell (brion2021limkinasesin pages 1-2, coumans2018cofilinandprofilin pages 2-4). This actin stabilization is critical for maintaining cell shape, supporting the formation of cellular protrusions necessary for motility, and regulating the cell cycle and differentiation processes (brion2021limkinasesin pages 1-2, chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 8-10). In addition to its role in actin regulation, LIMK1 has been shown to phosphorylate TPPP, leading to microtubule disassembly; this dual regulation of both actin and microtubule cytoskeletal systems underscores its integrative function in controlling cellular architecture (brion2021limkinasesin pages 1-2, chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 8-10). \n\nLIMK1 expression is particularly high in neural tissues, where its activity is essential for processes such as axonal outgrowth, dendritic spine formation, and synaptic plasticity; these functions are critical determinants of brain development and cognitive function (chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 10-11). Aberrant LIMK1 activity has been implicated in several pathological conditions. For example, dysregulation of LIMK1 activity is associated with altered synaptic morphology in neurodevelopmental disorders such as Williams–Beuren syndrome, and increased LIMK1 activity has been observed in various cancers where it contributes to enhanced cell migration and invasiveness by stabilizing the actin cytoskeleton (fraboulet2022theroleof pages 13-15, brion2021limkinasesin pages 1-2). Furthermore, the role of LIMK1 in cytoskeletal dynamics extends to other cell types, including platelets and immune cells such as natural killer cells and microglia, where proper actin remodeling is essential for cell activation and function (chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 8-10). Thus, LIMK1 functions as a critical regulatory node that translates upstream Rho GTPase signals into precise changes in the cytoskeletal architecture, impacting processes from cell motility and adhesion to tissue morphogenesis and synaptic regulation.\n\n## 8. Other Comments  \nLIMK1 has garnered significant attention as a promising therapeutic target due to its central role in actin cytoskeleton reorganization and its implications in pathological conditions. In the context of cancer, targeting LIMK1 may reduce tumor invasiveness and metastasis by destabilizing the cytoskeletal structures required for cell migration (fraboulet2022theroleof pages 13-15, shah2023limk2amultifaceted pages 1-3). Its role in neural development further connects LIMK1 to neurodevelopmental disorders and cognitive impairments, exemplified by its involvement in Williams–Beuren syndrome, where deletion or dysregulation of the LIMK1 gene contributes to specific craniofacial and cognitive abnormalities (fraboulet2022theroleof pages 1-2, villalonga2023limkinaseslimk1 pages 31-32). Additionally, the unique “rock-and-poke” substrate recognition mechanism of LIMK1 offers novel opportunities for drug design. Inhibitors that target this allosteric substrate docking interface might provide increased selectivity over conventional ATP-competitive inhibitors, which often suffer from off-target effects (chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 4-6, villalonga2023limkinaseslimk1 pages 2-6). Current research is increasingly focused on detailed structural and computational studies in order to elucidate the conformational dynamics of LIMK1 and to design inhibitors that modulate its activity without interfering with upstream signaling components (pei2023computationalanalysisof pages 1-2, reys2022insilicoprofiling pages 29-32). \n\nFurthermore, mutations in LIMK1 that affect its activation loop phosphorylation or its ability to form proper intramolecular inhibitory contacts have been suggested as potential biomarkers for diseases characterized by cytoskeletal dysfunction. Beyond small molecule inhibitors, approaches such as PROTACs that induce selective degradation of LIMK1 are emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at abrogating its pathological effects (southekal2021integrativeanalysisof pages 19-25). In summary, LIMK1 remains at the forefront of research into cytoskeletal regulation, with multifaceted roles in normal physiology and in disease, making it an attractive candidate both for fundamental studies and for pharmacological intervention.\n\n## 9.

    "answer": "1. Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase ETK, encoded by the ETK yccC gene in Escherichia coli, belongs to the distinct bacterial tyrosine kinase (BY‐kinase) family that is evolutionarily unrelated to the canonical eukaryotic Hanks‐type kinases (grangeasse2012bacterialtyrosinekinases pages 1-2). BY‐kinases are present in the majority of sequenced bacterial genomes and have evolved as a separate lineage with conserved Walker ATP/GTP‐binding motifs that trace back to ancient nucleotide‐binding proteins (grangeasse2012bacterialtyrosinekinases pages 1-2, shi2014evolutionofbacterial pages 1-2). ETK, like other members such as Wzc and PtkA, is part of an evolutionarily divergent set of enzymes that display high sequence variability outside of core catalytic motifs, pointing to rapid evolution through gene duplications and horizontal gene transfer (grangeasse2012bacterialtyrosinekinases pages 2-3, shi2014evolutionofbacterial pages 1-2). Orthologs of ETK can be identified in other Proteobacteria, reflecting its widespread presence across gram-negative bacteria and its phylogenetic placement as a bacterial-specific enzyme that has no counterparts in eukaryotes (grangeasse2012bacterialtyrosinekinases pages 1-2, grangeasse2012bacterialtyrosinekinases pages 7-8).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nETK catalyzes the phosphorylation reaction in which a phosphate group is transferred from ATP to specific tyrosine residues on target substrate proteins. The overall reaction can be summarized as: ATP + protein–tyrosine → ADP + protein–phosphotyrosine + H⁺ (grangeasse2012bacterialtyrosinekinases pages 4-5). This reaction proceeds via an autokinase activity wherein ETK autophosphorylates its own C-terminal tyrosine-rich cluster through trans-phosphorylation, a process critical for regulating both its own activity and the phosphorylation of downstream substrates involved in polysaccharide and capsule synthesis (grangeasse2012bacterialtyrosinekinases pages 8-10, shi2014evolutionofbacterial pages 17-18).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of ETK is highly dependent on the presence of ATP as the phosphate donor and requires divalent metal ions, most notably Mg²⁺, for proper conformation of the ATP-binding site and efficient phosphoryl transfer (grangeasse2012bacterialtyrosinekinases pages 1-2, roskoski2015srcproteintyrosinekinase pages 2-4). In many kinases of this type, Mg²⁺ coordinates with the phosphate groups of ATP via conserved phosphate-binding loops including Walker A and Walker B motifs, an arrangement that is also expected to be operative in ETK (grangeasse2012bacterialtyrosinekinases pages 4-5, mccone2020astructurebasedapproach pages 22-26).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nETK exhibits a relatively relaxed substrate specificity that is characteristic of bacterial tyrosine kinases. While classical eukaryotic tyrosine kinases often phosphorylate substrates bearing defined consensus motifs, ETK instead targets a broad array of proteins typically involved in extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) synthesis, biofilm formation, and capsule biosynthesis (grangeasse2012bacterialtyrosinekinases pages 7-8, shi2014evolutionofbacterial pages 17-18). Key substrates include enzymes such as UDP‐glucose dehydrogenase (Ugd) whose phosphorylation enhances its activity, thereby linking ETK activity to bacterial resistance mechanisms and the production of capsule components (grangeasse2012bacterialtyrosinekinases pages 8-10, keskin2024reversephaseproteinmicroarrays pages 6-7). Although no strict consensus motif has been defined, phosphorylation generally occurs on tyrosine residues that are often found within flexible, disordered regions such as the C-terminal tyrosine cluster—this cluster functions both as an autophosphorylation site and as a docking site for substrate interactions (grangeasse2012bacterialtyrosinekinases pages 4-5, shi2014evolutionofbacterial pages 11-12).\n\n5. Structure  \nETK is organized as a modular transmembrane protein, typical of Proteobacterial BY-kinases, with an N-terminal region that includes one or more membrane-spanning segments and a large extracellular loop, and a cytoplasmic C-terminal catalytic domain (grangeasse2012bacterialtyrosinekinases pages 5-6, grangeasse2012bacterialtyrosinekinases pages 13-14). The cytoplasmic catalytic domain contains highly conserved motifs including Walker A, Walker A′, and Walker B regions necessary for ATP binding and hydrolysis (grangeasse2012bacterialtyrosinekinases pages 4-5, shi2014evolutionofbacterial pages 11-12). In addition, ETK possesses a distinctive C-terminal tyrosine cluster—typically comprising 3 to 7 tyrosine residues—that undergo autophosphorylation in trans; this autophosphorylation acts as a regulatory switch to modulate kinase activity (grangeasse2012bacterialtyrosinekinases pages 6-7, grangeasse2012bacterialtyrosinekinases pages 13-14). Structural studies of homologous BY-kinases from Escherichia coli, such as Wzc, indicate that the catalytic domain adopts a modified P-loop ATPase fold that is distinct from the classic Hanks-type kinase fold found in eukaryotes (grangeasse2012bacterialtyrosinekinases pages 5-6, roskoski2015srcproteintyrosinekinase pages 4-5). Although high-resolution 3D structures for ETK specifically are limited, insights from electron microscopy and crystallographic studies on related kinases suggest that ETK might form oligomeric assemblies, such as octameric rings, crucial for its functional activity in coordinating polysaccharide export (grangeasse2012bacterialtyrosinekinases pages 14-15, keskin2024reversephaseproteinmicroarrays pages 3-6).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of ETK is principally achieved through a dynamic phosphorylation cycle. ETK autophosphorylates on multiple tyrosine residues within its C-terminal tyrosine cluster in a trans-autophosphorylation mechanism that is critical for switching the kinase between active and inactive conformations (grangeasse2012bacterialtyrosinekinases pages 4-5, grangeasse2012bacterialtyrosinekinases pages 12-13). In addition to autophosphorylation, ETK activity is modulated by protein-protein interactions in the context of multi-protein complexes involved in capsule and exopolysaccharide synthesis; for example, two-component regulatory systems such as RcsABC and PmrAB have been implicated in controlling the expression and activation state of BY-kinases in E. coli (grangeasse2012bacterialtyrosinekinases pages 1-2, grangeasse2012bacterialtyrosinekinases pages 2-3). The oligomerization state of the kinase domain also plays a significant role: in its non-phosphorylated state, ETK is proposed to form structured oligomeric assemblies that dissociate upon autophosphorylation, thereby exposing substrate-binding sites for trans phosphorylation (grangeasse2012bacterialtyrosinekinases pages 14-15, roskoski2015srcproteintyrosinekinase pages 16-17). Furthermore, associated phosphatases, such as Wzb in E. coli, contribute to reversing autophosphorylation, thus providing a feedback mechanism to fine-tune kinase activity (grangeasse2012bacterialtyrosinekinases pages 12-13, shi2014evolutionofbacterial pages 17-18).\n\n7. Function  \nETK is critically involved in the regulation of exopolysaccharide synthesis, a process fundamental to capsule formation and biofilm development in pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli (grangeasse2012bacterialtyrosinekinases pages 1-2, grangeasse2012bacterialtyrosinekinases pages 7-8). By phosphorylating substrates such as UDP‐glucose dehydrogenase, ETK enhances enzymatic activities that contribute to the assembly and export of capsular polysaccharides, thereby impacting bacterial virulence and resistance to environmental stresses including antibiotics and host antimicrobial peptides (grangeasse2012bacterialtyrosinekinases pages 8-10, keskin2024reversephaseproteinmicroarrays pages 6-7). Beyond its role in polysaccharide production, ETK is thought to participate in broader signaling pathways that govern bacterial cell division, stress responses, and adaptation through modulation of key metabolic enzymes (grangeasse2012bacterialtyrosinekinases pages 12-13, shi2014evolutionofbacterial pages 17-18). Expression of ETK is under the control of complex regulatory networks responsive to environmental cues such as nutrient availability, pH, and ionic conditions, linking its activity to the adaptive strategies of pathogenic bacteria (grangeasse2012bacterialtyrosinekinases pages 2-3, grangeasse2012bacterialtyrosinekinases pages 7-8).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nRecent high-throughput methodologies, including reverse-phase protein microarrays, have validated ETK’s kinase activity by demonstrating its ATP-dependent autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation profiles, underscoring its functional relevance within the bacterial proteome (keskin2024reversephaseproteinmicroarrays pages 1-2, keskin2024reversephaseproteinmicroarrays pages 3-6). Although specific small molecule inhibitors targeting ETK have not been as extensively characterized as those for eukaryotic tyrosine kinases, the unique structural and regulatory features of bacterial BY-kinases render them attractive targets for the development of novel antimicrobial strategies (grangeasse2012bacterialtyrosinekinases pages 13-14, roskoski2015srcproteintyrosinekinase pages 7-8). Disease associations primarily relate to the role of ETK in bacterial virulence, with its activity being directly linked to capsule formation and biofilm production, both of which contribute to antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity in clinical isolates of E. coli (grangeasse2012bacterialtyrosinekinases pages 1-2, shi2014evolutionofbacterial pages 17-18). Current areas of active research include elucidating the precise molecular mechanisms governing ETK’s autophosphorylation and its interplay with other components of the polysaccharide assembly machinery, as well as the identification of specific inhibitors that could disrupt its kinase activity (grangeasse2012bacterialtyrosinekinases pages 14-15, keskin2024reversephaseproteinmicroarrays pages 6-7).\n\n9.

    "answer": "1. Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‑protein kinase ITK (also known as Interleukin‑2‑inducible T‑cell kinase, Kinase EMT, T‑cell‑specific kinase, or Tyrosine‑protein kinase Lyk; UniProt ID Q08881) is a member of the Tec family of non‑receptor tyrosine kinases that evolved to mediate adaptive immune responses in vertebrates. ITK is phylogenetically distinct from other kinase families such as the Src and AGC groups, and its evolutionary trajectory reveals a specialization for T‑cell signaling. Sequence comparisons have shown that ITK shares extensive conservation with homologs in other vertebrate species, underscoring its essential role in T‑cell receptor (TCR) signaling events. Within the Tec kinase family, ITK is closely related to Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) and RLK/Txk; while BTK primarily governs B‑cell development, ITK has evolved specific functions necessary for T‑cell activation and differentiation. The domain architecture, including the pleckstrin homology (PH), Tec homology (TH), SH3, and SH2 domains, is highly conserved among these kinases, indicating that these regulatory modules were established in a common ancestral gene prior to the divergence of lymphocyte lineages (andreotti2018multidomaincontrolover pages 6-8, bhanumathy2021proteintyrosinekinases pages 2-4).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nITK catalyzes the transfer of the γ‑phosphate from ATP to the hydroxyl group of tyrosine residues on specific substrate proteins. In formal biochemical notation, the reaction is represented as:  \n  ATP + [protein]-tyrosine → ADP + [protein]-phosphotyrosine + H⁺.  \nThis phosphorylation event is pivotal, as it induces conformational changes in the substrate, modulates protein–protein interactions, and often alters subcellular localization, which together help propagate intracellular signals. During T‑cell activation, ITK is recruited to the plasma membrane via its PH domain, becomes phosphorylated by the Src family kinase LCK, and then, once activated, phosphorylates several downstream effectors. One of its best characterized substrates is phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLCG1); once phosphorylated, PLCG1 undergoes a conformational change that activates its lipase activity leading to the cleavage of phosphatidylinositol 4,5‑bisphosphate (PIP₂) into the second messengers inositol 1,4,5‑trisphosphate (IP₃) and diacylglycerol (DAG). This reaction, in turn, triggers calcium release from intracellular stores and activates transcriptional programs via nuclear factor of activated T‑cells (NFAT). In addition, ITK phosphorylates adaptor proteins such as LAT and LCP2, and modulates the activity of transcription factors like TBX21 (T‑bet) by phosphorylation at tyrosine 530, which affects its interaction with GATA3—a modification important for T‑helper cell lineage decisions (andreotti2018multidomaincontrolover pages 1-3, ghosh2018interleukin2inducibletcellkinase pages 3-4).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nFor its enzymatic function, ITK, like most tyrosine kinases, strictly requires divalent metal ions, principally magnesium (Mg²⁺). Magnesium ions coordinate with ATP in the active site to form a Mg²⁺–ATP complex; this complex properly orients the γ‑phosphate group for an efficient nucleophilic attack by the tyrosine hydroxyl group of the substrate protein. The presence of Mg²⁺ thereby lowers the activation energy for the phosphate transfer and helps stabilize the transition state during catalysis. In addition to its requirement for Mg²⁺, ITK’s activity is also regulated by its subcellular localization. The pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of ITK binds specifically to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5‑trisphosphate (PIP₃), a lipid second messenger generated by PI3K activity at the plasma membrane. Although PIP₃ is not a cofactor in the classic sense, its binding is essential for bringing ITK into proximity with its substrates and upstream activators such as LCK, hence indirectly promoting the catalytic reaction (howe2019magnesiumrestoresactivity pages 7-8, bilkova2021contemporaryenzymebasedmethods pages 21-22).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nITK displays remarkable substrate specificity that is central to its role in finely tuning T‑cell receptor signaling. The kinase primarily phosphorylates substrates that are directly involved in initiating and propagating T‑cell signals. One of the foremost substrates is phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLCG1), whose phosphorylation is a prerequisite for its conversion of PIP₂ into the critical second messengers IP₃ and DAG. Beyond PLCG1, ITK phosphorylates central adaptor proteins such as LAT (Linker for Activation of T‑cells) and LCP2; phosphorylated LAT and LCP2 serve as scaffolds for the recruitment of additional signaling molecules, including the guanine nucleotide exchange factor VAV1, thereby facilitating extensive signaling network assembly downstream of the TCR. Furthermore, ITK phosphorylates the transcription factor TBX21 (T‑bet) at tyrosine residue 530, a modification that modulates its interaction with GATA3 and thereby influences the differentiation balance between Th1 and Th2 responses. While a strict consensus motif has not been fully delineated for ITK substrates, available data suggest that the kinase selectively targets proteins that are enriched in T‑cell receptor signaling complexes and that possess accessible tyrosine residues in specific structural contexts that allow for efficient substrate recognition (ghosh2018interleukin2inducibletcellkinase pages 3-4, andreotti2018multidomaincontrolover pages 24-26, andreotti2018multidomaincontrolover pages 28-29).\n\n5. Structure  \nThe structural organization of ITK is emblematic of its multifunctional regulatory roles, being composed of several well-conserved domains. At its N‑terminus resides the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which not only mediates the specific binding to phosphoinositide lipids such as PIP₃ (critical for membrane localization) but also exerts autoinhibitory functions by engaging intramolecularly with the kinase domain. Studies have demonstrated that mutations within the β3‑β4 loop of the PH domain, which is rich in basic residues, can disrupt this autoinhibitory interaction and lead to increased kinase activity (devkota2017anautoinhibitoryrole pages 1-3, basu2023gapjunctionalintercellulara pages 66-71).\n\nImmediately following the PH domain is the Tec homology (TH) domain; although less characterized than its neighboring modules, the TH domain is thought to assist in proper protein folding and may harbor sequences that interact with proline-rich motifs. Sequentially, ITK contains an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain and an Src homology 2 (SH2) domain. The SH3 domain typically recognizes and binds to proline‑rich sequences on interacting proteins, while the SH2 domain binds to phosphorylated tyrosine residues; both domains are critical for mediating the assembly of signaling complexes upon T‑cell receptor engagement.\n\nCentral within ITK is the kinase domain, a bilobed structure common to protein kinases. The smaller N‑lobe is responsible for binding ATP—this binding is Mg²⁺‑dependent—while the larger C‑lobe contains the substrate binding region and the activation loop. Conserved motifs within the kinase domain, such as the DFG motif, are essential for catalytic function. Crystallographic and NMR studies have revealed that in its resting state, autoinhibitory interactions, particularly those between the PH domain and the kinase domain, help maintain ITK in an inactive conformation. Upon binding of phosphoinositides like PIP₃, this inhibitory interface is disrupted, leading to exposure of the activation loop and subsequent phosphorylation (devkota2017anautoinhibitoryrole pages 9-11, andreotti2018multidomaincontrolover pages 29-30, amatya2019dynamicregulatoryfeatures pages 1-3).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of ITK is a complex process that ensures precise control over T‑cell activation. In resting T‑cells, ITK is maintained in an autoinhibited state by intramolecular interactions—most notably, the PH domain contacts the kinase domain via the β3‑β4 loop, hindering access to the active site. This autoinhibitory conformation prevents unwarranted activation of downstream signaling events and maintains immune quiescence. Upon T‑cell receptor engagement, activation of phosphatidylinositol 3‑kinase (PI3K) leads to the generation of PIP₃ at the plasma membrane; the PIP₃ binds to the PH domain of ITK and induces a conformational change that disrupts the autoinhibitory contacts. This lipid-mediated allosteric regulation facilitates the translocation of ITK to the membrane, where it becomes accessible to the Src family kinase LCK. LCK phosphorylates a critical tyrosine residue within the activation loop of ITK, triggering further autophosphorylation events that fully activate the kinase (andreotti2018multidomaincontrolover pages 6-8, devkota2017anautoinhibitoryrole pages 3-4).\n\nAdditional layers of regulation are imposed by interactions with adaptor proteins such as LAT and LCP2, which stabilize the active conformation of ITK and promote the assembly of multi‐protein signaling complexes. Moreover, small molecule phosphoinositides such as inositol (1,3,4,5)‑tetrakisphosphate (IP₄) can compete with the autoinhibitory interface of the PH domain, further promoting activation. In certain contexts, calcium/calmodulin binding to sites overlapping the PH domain can also enhance ITK activity by preventing reassociation of the autoinhibitory interface. These multiple regulatory inputs—phospholipid binding, phosphorylation by LCK, adaptor protein interactions, and calmodulin association—together ensure that ITK activation is both tightly controlled and responsive to antigen receptor stimulation (andreotti2018multidomaincontrolover pages 20-23, devkota2017anautoinhibitoryrole pages 22-23, hsu2023selectiveinhibitionof pages 14-16).\n\n7. Function  \nITK serves as a pivotal amplifier in T‑cell receptor signaling. Its activation is essential for translating extracellular antigen recognition into robust intracellular responses that culminate in T‑cell proliferation, cytokine production, and differentiation. Following antigen presentation to the T‑cell receptor, ITK is recruited to the plasma membrane via its PH domain; this localization facilitates its phosphorylation by LCK and subsequent autophosphorylation. Once active, ITK phosphorylates key substrates such as PLCG1. The phosphorylation of PLCG1 activates its lipase function, leading to the generation of second messengers IP₃ and DAG from PIP₂; IP₃ stimulates the release of Ca²⁺ from the endoplasmic reticulum, while DAG, in combination with elevated Ca²⁺ levels, helps activate protein kinase C (PKC). This cascade ultimately results in the nuclear translocation of NFAT and other transcription factors, which drive the expression of genes involved in T‑cell proliferation, differentiation, and effector function.\n\nIn addition to PLCG1, ITK phosphorylates adaptor proteins such as LAT and LCP2, which serve to assemble larger signalosomes by recruiting downstream effectors like VAV1. These complexes mediate further signal propagation that leads to cytoskeletal rearrangements and additional activation of mitogen‑activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. A particularly notable function of ITK is its phosphorylation of the transcription factor TBX21 (T‑bet) at tyrosine 530. This modification modulates T‑bet’s interaction with GATA3, thereby influencing the differentiation of T‑helper cell subsets, specifically balancing Th1/Th2 lineage commitment. ITK is not only critical for classical αβ T‑cell function but also plays a role in the T‑cell receptor-mediated signaling in gamma‑delta T cells, further emphasizing its broad importance in T‑cell biology (andreotti2018multidomaincontrolover pages 1-3, basu2023gapjunctionalintercellular pages 165-167, elmore2021tyrosinekinaseitk pages 59-61).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nBecause of its central role in T‑cell receptor signaling and adaptive immune modulation, ITK has become an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Small molecule inhibitors of ITK, such as the covalent inhibitor PRN694, have been developed based on structural features of the kinase domain and are being explored for their utility in treating immune‑mediated disorders and T‑cell malignancies. These inhibitors function by binding to the ATP‑binding pocket or by interfering with the allosteric regulation imposed by the PH domain, and they have shown promise in preclinical models of allergic asthma, autoimmune diseases, and certain lymphomas (bunuel2024targetingzap70protein pages 175-178, hsu2023selectiveinhibitionof pages 16-20).\n\nFurthermore, genetic deficiency or mutations in ITK have been linked to severe immunodeficiency syndromes characterized by impaired T‑cell activation, susceptibility to viral infections (notably Epstein‑Barr virus), and an increased risk of lymphoproliferative disorders. Some mutations disrupt critical domains, such as the PH, SH2, or kinase domain, leading to misregulation of signal transduction and subsequent immune dysregulation. Ongoing research aims to elucidate the detailed structural mechanisms governing ITK’s autoinhibition and activation, utilizing advanced techniques like hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, small‑angle X‑ray scattering, and computational modeling. These studies not only improve our understanding of ITK biology but also facilitate the rational design of next‑generation therapeutic agents with enhanced specificity and potency.\n\nThe balanced regulation of T‑helper cell differentiation by ITK is another area of active investigation. ITK modulates the production of key cytokines across various T‑cell subsets, influencing the shift between pro‑inflammatory responses (e.g., Th17) and regulatory or anti‑inflammatory responses (e.g., Tregs). This fine tuning is critical for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing conditions such as autoimmunity and chronic inflammation. As a result, ITK is considered a potential biomarker for immune function as well as a therapeutic target for modulating immune responses in diseases including allergic asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, and certain autoimmune lymphomas (andreotti2018multidomaincontrolover pages 28-29, basu2023gapjunctionalintercellulara pages 66-71).\n\n9.

    "answer": "1. Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase Tec (gene: TEC, UniProt: P42680) is a member of the Tec family of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases, a subgroup that also includes Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK), interleukin‐2–inducible T‐cell kinase (ITK), BMX/ETK, TXK (also known as RLK) and others. The Tec family is evolutionarily conserved among vertebrates and is present in diverse hematopoietic lineages. Phylogenetically, these kinases can be traced back to early metazoans, and their presence in numerous species suggests they form an ancient branch of the tyrosine kinome. They belong to the cytoplasmic (non‐receptor) tyrosine kinase group, which stands apart from receptor tyrosine kinases that evolved by gene fusion with extracellular ligand–binding domains. Comparative analyses have shown that the domain architecture characteristic of Tec kinases—comprising an N‐terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a BTK‐type zinc finger region, and tandem Src‐homology (SH3 and SH2) domains preceding the kinase domain—is deeply conserved (siveen2018roleofnon pages 6-8, alexander2015theconciseguide pages 10-13). Orthologs of TEC exist throughout mammals and are also found in lower vertebrates, confirming their ancient origin and essential role in the adaptive immune system (yeung2021evolutionoffunctional pages 9-10).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nTec catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to specific tyrosine residues on target proteins. The general reaction can be described as follows:  \n  ATP + [Protein]-L-tyrosine → ADP + [Protein]-phospho-L-tyrosine + H^+  \nPhysiologically, Tec phosphorylates substrates that are integral to cell signaling. For example, it phosphorylates DOK1 and STAP1 in the context of CD28- and B-cell receptor (BCR)-mediated signaling, respectively, and it is responsible for the phosphorylation of FGF2 on Tyr-215, which is critical for an unconventional secretion pathway. In addition, Tec-mediated phosphorylation of GRB10 has been implicated in the reciprocal regulation of FOS transcription (siveen2018roleofnon pages 6-8). Although the precise kinetic mechanism and transient intermediates remain to be fully elucidated, the enzyme follows the general mechanism of tyrosine kinases where proper alignment of the substrate’s hydroxyl group and coordinated binding of ATP are essential to facilitate efficient phosphoryl transfer (oliveira2016revisitingproteinkinase–substrate pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nLike other protein kinases, Tec requires ATP as a phosphate donor and typically depends on the presence of divalent metal ions to coordinate ATP binding. In most tyrosine kinases, Mg^2+ is essential for phosphotransfer activity because it stabilizes the negative charges of the ATP phosphate groups and is coordinated by conserved residues in the kinase active site. Although explicit experimental details for Tec are not provided in every report, by analogy with related kinases (e.g., BTK, ITK) and information on the conserved active site geometry drawn from structural studies, it is widely accepted that Tec relies on Mg^2+ for catalytic activity (alexander2015theconciseguide pages 10-13, taft2017ayeastbasedassay pages 13-22).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nTec’s substrate specificity is determined by both the intrinsic properties of its catalytic domain and interactions mediated by its regulatory domains. Among its known physiological substrates are:\n • DOK1, which acts as a substrate during signaling downstream of CD28 in T cells, thereby contributing to adaptive immune regulation (siveen2018roleofnon pages 6-8).  \n • STAP1, a B-cell receptor (BCR)–associated protein that becomes phosphorylated by Tec, thereby playing a role in B-cell activation and development (siveen2018roleofnon pages 6-8).  \n • FGF2, where phosphorylation of Tyr-215 by Tec modulates an unconventional secretion mechanism from the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi (siveen2018roleofnon pages 6-8).  \n • GRB10, whose phosphorylation by Tec is involved in attenuating FOS transcriptional activation (siveen2018roleofnon pages 6-8).  \nAlthough a defined consensus substrate motif for Tec has not been as rigorously established as for some serine/threonine kinases, its substrate recognition likely involves coordination of residues adjacent to the target tyrosine by interactions contributed by its kinase domain as well as docking interactions mediated by SH2 and SH3 domains. These domains help in the spatial localization and substrate engagement within receptor complexes (bryan2018kinaseinhibitorsfor pages 8-10, oliveira2016revisitingproteinkinase–substrate pages 1-2).\n\n5. Structure  \nTec exhibits a modular architecture that is characteristic of the Tec family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases. Its domain organization is as follows:\n • An N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which binds phosphoinositides such as PIP3. This binding recruits Tec to cellular membranes where lipid signaling is active.  \n • A BTK-type zinc finger (or BTK motif), which is thought to contribute to protein stability and may also play a role in substrate interactions.  \n • SH3 and SH2 domains that mediate protein–protein interactions. The SH3 domain typically binds proline-rich motifs, whereas the SH2 domain specifically engages phosphotyrosine-containing sequences. Together, these domains are critical for assembling signaling complexes and for allosteric regulation (siveen2018roleofnon pages 6-8, alexander2015theconciseguide pages 10-13).  \n • A C-terminal kinase (catalytic) domain that is bilobal—with the N-terminal lobe largely consisting of β-sheets and the C-terminal lobe rich in α-helices—and contains the active site responsible for ATP binding and phosphotransfer. Key catalytic residues include the invariant aspartate necessary for catalysis and likely a cysteine residue in the ATP-binding pocket that can serve as a site for covalent inhibitor interaction (e.g., in dual JAK3/TEC inhibitors) (xu2019pf06651600adual pages 6-7, lin2024conformationalheterogeneityof pages 27-28).  \nHigh-resolution structural information obtained by crystallography and computational methods such as AlphaFold modeling has provided insights into the conformational flexibility of the kinase domain and autoinhibitory states mediated via interdomain contacts (chopra2016dynamicallosterymediated pages 1-2, lin2024conformationalheterogeneityof pages 27-28).\n\n6. Regulation  \nTec is regulated through a combination of post-translational modifications and domain–domain interactions that modulate its catalytic activity. The following regulatory mechanisms have been described:\n • Phosphorylation events: Tec itself is subject to tyrosine phosphorylation events that can either promote or inhibit its activity. For instance, autophosphorylation within the activation loop of the catalytic domain is an essential step for full activation, while phosphorylation events on other regulatory residues may modulate its interactions with partner proteins (siveen2018roleofnon pages 6-8, andreotti2010tcellsignalingregulated pages 18-19).  \n • Lipid binding: The PH domain of Tec binds phosphoinositides (especially PIP3), enabling its membrane localization where it is activated by receptor signals. This spatial regulation is critical for initiating downstream signaling cascades (lien2017pi3ksignalingin pages 4-6).  \n • Protein–protein interactions: The SH2 and SH3 domains play key roles in docking to phosphorylated partners and proline-rich sequences, respectively. Such interactions not only target Tec to specific signaling complexes but also contribute to its autoinhibition through intramolecular associations that restrict its kinase activity in the absence of activating signals (chopra2016dynamicallosterymediated pages 17-18, raussendorf2017aswitchin pages 1-2).  \n • Reciprocal phosphorylation: Tec cooperates with other kinases, notably JAK2, through reciprocal phosphorylation events that modulate transcription factor activation (e.g., FOS induction) downstream of cytokine signaling (siveen2018roleofnon pages 6-8, xu2019pf06651600adual pages 7-8).  \nIn addition, allosteric regulation involving interdomain contacts and coupled conformational transitions—such as those mediated by dynamic changes in the αC helix and the regulatory spine—is emerging as a critical mechanism controlling Tec kinase activity (chopra2016dynamicallosterymediated pages 1-2, raussendorf2017aswitchin pages 8-9).\n\n7. Function  \nTec functions as a signal transducer in multiple downstream pathways emanating from a variety of receptor types. Its biological roles include:\n • Immune cell signaling: Tec plays a redundant role relative to ITK in T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling. It is required for TCR-dependent IL-2 gene induction and contributes to the differentiation and function of conventional T cells as well as nonconventional natural killer T (NKT) cells (siveen2018roleofnon pages 6-8, andreotti2010tcellsignalingregulated pages 19-19).  \n • B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling: Tec acts redundantly with BTK to facilitate B-cell development and activation. In this context, phosphorylation of the adaptor protein STAP1 by Tec is important for propagating BCR-mediated signals (siveen2018roleofnon pages 6-8).  \n • Mast cell and myeloid cell activation: Tec is required in mast cells for efficient cytokine production and contributes to the growth, differentiation, and functional activation of myeloid cells in response to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (CSF3) (siveen2018roleofnon pages 6-8).  \n • Platelet signaling: Tec participates in integrin-mediated platelet signaling, thus playing a role in thrombus formation and hemostasis.  \n • Hepatocyte proliferation and liver regeneration: Tec is involved in transducing signals downstream of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and mediates ERK signaling, which is critical for liver regeneration (siveen2018roleofnon pages 6-8).  \n • Regulation of unconventional secretion: By phosphorylating FGF2 on Tyr-215, Tec regulates an ER/Golgi-independent secretion mechanism that is important under various physiological conditions.  \n • Modulation of transcription factors: Tec can influence gene expression by, for example, phosphorylating GRB10—a negative regulator of FOS transcription—thereby impacting cytokine-driven growth and differentiation signals (siveen2018roleofnon pages 6-8, xu2019pf06651600adual pages 7-8).  \nCollectively, these functions underline Tec’s broad role in mediating signaling from cytokine receptors, receptor tyrosine kinases, G-protein–coupled receptors, and integrins, with significant impacts on immune regulation, hematopoiesis, liver regeneration, and even osteoclast differentiation (siveen2018roleofnon pages 6-8, OpenTargets Search: -TEC).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nTec is emerging as an important therapeutic target given its pivotal roles in signaling pathways that contribute to both normal immune function and disease pathogenesis. Dual inhibitors that target both JAK3 and Tec family kinases, such as PF-06651600, have been shown to modulate immune cell functions including T-cell activation and cytolytic responses in CD8^+ T cells and natural killer cells (xu2019pf06651600adual pages 1-2, xu2019pf06651600adual pages 7-8). In addition, abnormal Tec signaling has been implicated in tumorigenesis (for example, via overexpression in liver cancers) and its precise regulation is associated with control of hematologic malignancies and inflammatory diseases. Although specific clinically approved inhibitors directly targeting Tec are not currently well established, inhibitors developed against related Tec family members (such as BTK inhibitors) highlight the translational potential of modulating Tec activity (bryan2018kinaseinhibitorsfor pages 8-10). Recent genetic association studies and database searches (OpenTargets Search: -TEC) further support the notion that TEC signaling plays a role in autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and alopecia areata. From a research perspective, ongoing studies are focused on detailed structural analyses (including crystallographic and AlphaFold-based approaches) and dynamic regulation via allosteric mechanisms to better understand substrate specificity and post-translational modifications that govern Tec activity (chopra2016dynamicallosterymediated pages 1-2, lin2024conformationalheterogeneityof pages 27-28). These insights might ultimately lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies to modulate Tec-dependent signaling in diverse clinical contexts.\n\n9.

    "answer": "## 1. Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase TXK, also known as Protein‐tyrosine kinase 4 (PTK4) or Resting lymphocyte kinase (RLK), is classified within the non‐receptor tyrosine kinase superfamily and, more specifically, the Tec family of kinases. Comparative phylogenetic analyses consistently group TXK alongside other Tec family members such as interleukin‐2 inducible T‐cell kinase (ITK), Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), TEC, and Bmx, all of which are involved in intracellular signaling in lymphocytes and have evolved specialized regulatory features to mediate immune responses (bradshaw2010thesrcsyk pages 3-5). Molecular phylogenetics based on kinase domain sequences has revealed that the Tec family arose from a common ancestral kinase that existed early in vertebrate evolution, with gene duplication events later giving rise to the distinct family members. In the context of the kinome, TXK is positioned in a clade that exhibits a conserved catalytic core common to cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, but distinguishes itself by unique protein modules that are not present in other Tec kinases. For instance, while most Tec family kinases harbor an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and Tec homology (TH) domain, TXK is divergent in that its N-terminal region is replaced by a unique cysteine-rich string motif which undergoes palmitoylation; this divergence is evolutionarily conserved and indicative of its specialized role in T-cell signaling (eshaq2024nonreceptortyrosinekinases pages 9-12).  \nAnalyses performed using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methodologies have demonstrated that the Tec family members, including TXK, maintain a high degree of orthology across vertebrate species; orthologs of TXK have been identified in mammals ranging from rodents to primates, attesting to its integral role in adaptive immunity (bhanumathy2021proteintyrosinekinases pages 2-4, yeung2021evolutionoffunctional pages 3-6). In broader kinome surveys, TXK belongs to the cytoplasmic branch of tyrosine kinases and appears as part of an evolutionarily conserved set of kinases that participate in immune receptor signaling. Furthermore, comparative studies of protein domain organization among Tec family kinases have highlighted that while most family members follow a canonical modular layout, TXK’s distinct N-terminal structure marks it as a specialized member within this group and suggests that selective pressures during vertebrate evolution have tailored its regulatory properties to suit particular signaling functions in T lymphocytes (santos2016paralogspecificpatternsof pages 1-1). Recent genomic surveys and orthology analyses further indicate that the Tec family, with TXK as a representative member, emerged early in the evolution of adaptive immunity and that the conservation of its catalytic domain coupled with innovative regulatory motifs has ensured its functional preservation over millions of years (liu2017identificationandcharacterization pages 2-4). Together, these phylogenetic insights underscore the evolutionary importance of TXK and its close relationship with other Tec kinases that coordinate T-cell activation and differentiation.\n\n## 2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nTXK catalyzes the transfer of the γ‐phosphate from ATP to a specific tyrosine residue on target protein substrates, an essential modification that modulates protein function and initiates downstream signaling cascades in lymphocytes (xu2019pf06651600adual pages 7-8). In the catalytic mechanism of TXK, ATP binds within a conserved kinase domain where it is properly oriented by key residues of the glycine-rich loop and ATP-binding pocket; this precise arrangement facilitates the nucleophilic attack by the hydroxyl oxygen of a tyrosine residue on the substrate (vargas2013inhibitorsofbtk pages 1-3). The reaction is described by the general kinase-catalyzed equation: ATP + substrate protein (with a free tyrosine hydroxyl group) yields ADP plus the phosphorylated protein, with the newly incorporated phosphate group inducing conformational changes that regulate protein–protein interactions and enzymatic activity (xu2019pf06651600adual pages 7-8).  \nIn the context of T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling, TXK plays a pivotal role by phosphorylating substrates such as phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLCG1), thereby driving its recruitment to lipid rafts and subsequent activation. The phosphorylation of PLCG1 triggers the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), which in turn facilitates calcium mobilization from the endoplasmic reticulum and leads to the activation of downstream transcription factors including NFAT (bhanumathy2021proteintyrosinekinases pages 1-2).  \nThis phosphorylation event by TXK is reversible and is subject to tight regulation by protein tyrosine phosphatases, ensuring that the signaling cascades remain transient and accurately calibrated according to physiological needs (gocek2014nonreceptorproteintyrosine pages 1-2). Thus, TXK acts as a molecular switch in T cells, whereby its catalytic activity directly converts extracellular receptor engagement into intracellular phosphorylation signals that ultimately regulate gene expression, cytokine production, and other cellular processes necessary for effective immune responses.\n\n## 3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe enzymatic activity of TXK depends critically on the coordination of ATP with divalent metal ions that act as essential cofactors. Magnesium ions (Mg²⁺) are the primary cofactors required for TXK activity, as they stabilize the binding of ATP via coordination with the phosphate groups, thereby lowering the activation energy for the enzymatic reaction (xu2019pf06651600adual pages 7-8). Mg²⁺ ions interact with residues in the ATP-binding pocket of the kinase domain to ensure that ATP is precisely oriented for efficient phosphotransfer to the tyrosine residue on substrate proteins (castelosoccio2023proteinkinasesdrug pages 1-2).  \nExperimental studies on related tyrosine kinases, such as those in the Tec family, have noted that under non-physiological conditions other divalent cations like Mn²⁺ can functionally substitute for Mg²⁺; however, in physiological conditions, TXK activity is predominantly magnesium-dependent (fu2024largescaleanalysisof pages 1-3). In addition to the metal cofactor, although accessory molecules (e.g., phosphatidylinositols) are influential in directing membrane localization and protein interactions within Tec kinases, they do not directly contribute to the catalytic mechanism of phosphotransfer. Therefore, Mg²⁺ remains the critical cofactor that underpins the efficient catalytic cycle of TXK, a requirement that is characteristic of most protein kinases and essential for its role in intracellular signaling.\n\n## 4. Substrate Specificity  \nTXK exhibits a finely tuned substrate specificity that is central to its role in orchestrating signaling networks within T cells. One of the primary substrates of TXK is phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLCG1). Post-phosphorylation by TXK, PLCG1 undergoes a localization shift into lipid rafts where it then catalyzes the hydrolysis of PIP2 into the second messengers IP3 and DAG, which subsequently trigger Ca²⁺ release from the endoplasmic reticulum and activate the NFAT transcription factor (bhanumathy2021proteintyrosinekinases pages 1-2).  \nIn addition to PLCG1, TXK phosphorylates components of a multiprotein complex that regulates interferon-gamma (IFNG) transcription in T-helper 1 (Th1) cells. Within this promoter-binding complex, TXK targets poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) and eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A1 (EEF1A1), resulting in enhanced transcriptional activation of IFNG—a critical cytokine in anti-microbial and anti-tumor immune responses (bhanumathy2021proteintyrosinekinases pages 2-4).  \nTXK further modulates T-cell function by phosphorylating the adaptor protein LCP2; this phosphorylation event is linked to the up-regulation of interleukin-2 (IL-2), a cytokine vital for T-cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. Moreover, TXK phosphorylates CTLA4 at Tyr-201, a modification that creates a binding interface for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and integrates inhibitory signaling into the overall T-cell activation network (xu2019pf06651600adual pages 7-8).  \nStructural determinants of substrate specificity in TXK arise from its modular domain composition. The SH2 domain of TXK is specialized in recognizing phosphotyrosine-containing motifs on target proteins, ensuring that substrates which have been pre-phosphorylated by upstream kinases or other signaling events are efficiently engaged. In parallel, the SH3 domain facilitates interactions with proline-rich sequences within regulatory proteins. These binding modules work concertedly with the catalytic kinase domain to ensure that phosphorylation occurs within precise spatial and temporal contexts, thereby reinforcing the fidelity of T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling (vargas2013inhibitorsofbtk pages 1-3).  \nAlthough comprehensive peptide library studies have suggested potential consensus sequences around the phosphorylation sites preferred by TXK, a singular consensus motif for TXK has yet to be definitively established; rather, its substrate recognition appears to be an emergent property of the integrated contributions from its catalytic and regulatory domains.\n\n## 5. Structure  \nThe structural organization of TXK is emblematic of the Tec family kinases, yet it is marked by unique features that differentiate it from its relatives. Unlike typical Tec kinases that commence with an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain coupled with a Tec homology (TH) domain, TXK is characterized by an atypical N-terminal region lacking these domains. Instead, TXK contains a cysteine-rich string motif whose residues are prime candidates for palmitoylation, thereby facilitating membrane association—a critical function given TXK’s role in T-cell signaling (eshaq2024nonreceptortyrosinekinases pages 9-12).  \nFollowing this unconventional N-terminal extension, TXK exhibits conserved modular domains that include the Src Homology 3 (SH3) domain, which mediates interactions with proline-rich sequences from other signaling proteins. The SH3 domain plays an integral role in transient protein–protein interactions that are essential for the assembly of multiprotein complexes at the plasma membrane (bradshaw2010thesrcsyk pages 3-5). Adjacent to the SH3 domain is the Src Homology 2 (SH2) domain, which is specialized in recognizing phosphotyrosine motifs in target proteins. This domain is critical for the recruitment of phosphorylated substrates and adaptor proteins to TXK during TCR signaling (bradshaw2010thesrcsyk pages 3-5).  \nCentral to TXK’s function is its kinase catalytic domain, which conforms to the canonical bilobal structure observed in eukaryotic protein kinases. The N-terminal lobe of this catalytic domain consists of a five-stranded β-sheet and includes a glycine-rich loop that is central to nucleotide binding, while the predominantly α-helical C-terminal lobe houses the subdomains responsible for substrate catalysis. A key feature within this catalytic domain is the activation loop, whose phosphorylation at Tyr-420 is indispensable for full kinase activation; phosphorylation at this site triggers a conformational realignment that opens the substrate-binding cleft and permits efficient catalysis (xu2019pf06651600adual pages 7-8).  \nAlthough no full-length crystal structure of TXK has been reported to date, homology models generated using computational algorithms such as those underlying the AlphaFold predictions have provided substantial insights into its three-dimensional architecture. These models corroborate the conservation of key catalytic motifs juxtaposed with the divergent architecture of the N-terminal regulatory region, thereby suggesting alternative mechanisms for membrane recruitment and substrate recognition in TXK compared to other Tec kinases (andreotti2018multidomaincontrolover pages 6-8). Structural studies of related kinases further indicate that critical residues in the active site—particularly those involved in coordinating ATP and facilitating phosphotransfer—are strictly conserved, underscoring the evolutionary pressure to maintain enzymatic function despite divergence in regulatory modules.\n\n## 6. Regulation  \nRegulation of TXK is achieved through an intricate network of post-translational modifications and protein–protein interactions that together fine-tune its activity in the immune cell. A central regulatory event is the phosphorylation of the activation loop at Tyr-420. This modification, which can be catalyzed by upstream Src family kinases or occur via autophosphorylation, is essential for relieving the autoinhibited conformation of TXK and transitioning the enzyme into a fully active state capable of substrate phosphorylation (bhanumathy2021proteintyrosinekinases pages 1-2, amatya2019dynamicregulatoryfeatures pages 7-9).  \nTXK regulation is further modulated through its dynamic interactions mediated by its SH2 and SH3 domains. The SH2 domain enables TXK to bind transiently to phosphotyrosine residues on activated receptors or adaptor proteins, thereby participating in the spatial organization of signaling complexes. Meanwhile, the SH3 domain engages binding partners that harbor proline-rich motifs; such interactions not only influence the localization of TXK but can also modulate its catalytic activity by altering conformational equilibria within the kinase (andreotti2018multidomaincontrolover pages 3-4).  \nIn addition to positive regulatory mechanisms, negative regulation is accomplished by protein tyrosine phosphatases that dephosphorylate critical tyrosine residues such as Tyr-420, thereby returning TXK to an inactive or autoinhibited state. This reversible phosphorylation ensures that TXK activity remains tightly controlled and temporally restricted to periods of antigen stimulation (eshaq2024nonreceptortyrosinekinases pages 1-2).  \nMembrane association is another key regulatory layer; despite the absence of the conventional PH domain, TXK’s unique N-terminal cysteine-rich motif undergoes palmitoylation—a lipid modification that promotes its targeting to the plasma membrane during T-cell receptor engagement. This membrane localization is essential for positioning TXK in proximity to its substrates and other components of the TCR signaling cascade (bradshaw2010thesrcsyk pages 3-5, eshaq2024nonreceptortyrosinekinases pages 9-12).  \nFurthermore, regulatory redundancy within the Tec family is evident in that TXK and ITK display overlapping functions; when the activity of one kinase is compromised, the other can partially compensate to ensure that downstream signaling events, particularly those leading to cytokine production and cellular activation, are maintained (hsu2023selectiveinhibitionof pages 16-20). This crosstalk between family members underscores the evolutionary conservation of regulatory mechanisms and highlights the elaborate control network that governs T-cell activation.\n\n## 7. Function  \nTXK plays a vital role in adaptive immunity by acting as a molecular switch in T-cell signaling. Expressed constitutively in resting lymphocytes, TXK is rapidly recruited to the plasma membrane following T-cell receptor (TCR) engagement by antigen-presenting cells. This recruitment is accompanied by its phosphorylation at Tyr-420, an event critical for full activation of the kinase and the initiation of downstream signaling pathways (bhanumathy2021proteintyrosinekinases pages 1-2, xu2019pf06651600adual pages 7-8).  \nOne of the most important functions of TXK is its ability to phosphorylate phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLCG1). Once phosphorylated, PLCG1 translocates to lipid rafts where it catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3); IP3, in turn, stimulates calcium release from intracellular stores, thereby promoting the activation of transcription factors such as NFAT (bhanumathy2021proteintyrosinekinases pages 1-2).  \nBeyond its effects on calcium signaling, TXK has a significant impact on T-cell differentiation and cytokine production. In T-helper 1 (Th1) cells, TXK is an essential component of a transcriptional regulatory complex that enhances the expression of interferon-gamma (IFNG). Within this complex, TXK phosphorylates both PARP1 and eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A1 (EEF1A1), thereby promoting IFNG gene transcription and reinforcing Th1-mediated immune responses (bhanumathy2021proteintyrosinekinases pages 2-4).  \nAdditionally, TXK modulates the activity of the adaptor protein LCP2, a key molecule in TCR signaling; phosphorylation of LCP2 by TXK is associated with the up-regulation of interleukin-2 (IL-2), which is central to T-cell clonal expansion and survival. Moreover, TXK phosphorylates the immunoregulatory receptor CTLA4 at Tyr-201, facilitating the recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). This modification is thought to integrate inhibitory signals with positive activation cues, thereby fine-tuning the amplitude of T-cell responses (xu2019pf06651600adual pages 7-8).  \nTXK is also implicated in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which is crucial for the dynamic remodeling of T cells during migration, the formation of the immunological synapse, and stable cell–cell contact during antigen recognition. This contribution further underscores the multifunctional nature of TXK in directing both biochemical signaling events and biophysical changes within immune cells (dievart2020originanddiversity pages 12-14).  \nOverall, the functions mediated by TXK underscore its role as a central hub in the adaptive immune response. Its ability to orchestrate a range of signaling events—from calcium mobilization and transcriptional activation to cytoskeletal rearrangements—ensures that T cells can mount rapid and robust responses upon encountering antigenic stimuli, thereby maintaining immune surveillance and host defense.\n\n## 8. Other Comments  \nGiven its central role in T-cell activation and regulation of cytokine production, TXK has garnered significant interest as a potential therapeutic target in conditions characterized by dysregulated immune responses, including autoimmune diseases and T-cell malignancies (yaron2020thefdaapproveddrug pages 1-4). Efforts to develop small molecule inhibitors that specifically target TXK—or that modulate the activity of multiple Tec family kinases—are ongoing and represent a promising avenue for immunomodulatory therapies. Inhibitors that selectively target TXK may offer advantages by minimizing off-target effects while preserving critical functions mediated by related kinases such as ITK (xu2019pf06651600adual pages 8-8, castelosoccio2023proteinkinasesdrug pages 1-2).  \nTXK’s unique structural features, most notably its divergent N-terminal cysteine-rich region instead of a canonical PH/TH domain, provide potential opportunities for the design of novel inhibitors that could exploit these differences. Such compounds might be developed to interfere selectively with TXK’s membrane association or to modulate its interactions with specific adaptor proteins. Although disease-associated mutations in TXK have not yet been widely characterized, alterations in critical residues—such as the activation loop Tyr-420—could feasibly impair its function and contribute to immune pathologies, making these sites potential biomarkers for diagnostic or prognostic applications (joseph2011controllingtheactivity pages 8-9).  \nRecent advances in structural biology, including efforts to determine the full-length three-dimensional structure of TXK using X-ray crystallography or cryo-electron microscopy, promise to shed further light on its regulatory mechanisms and facilitate the rational design of highly specific inhibitors (andreotti2018multidomaincontrolover pages 6-8). Additionally, ongoing research into the functional redundancy and compensatory interplay between TXK and ITK holds substantial promise for refining therapeutic strategies that aim to selectively modulate T-cell responses. For instance, selective inhibition of ITK while sparing TXK activity has been shown to preserve key anti-tumor functions of T cells, highlighting the potential benefits of targeting these kinases in a coordinated yet specific manner (hsu2023selectiveinhibitionof pages 16-20).  \nBeyond its roles in T-cell receptor signaling and cytokine gene transcription, TXK is increasingly recognized as a key regulator of the actin cytoskeleton, influencing not only immune cell activation but also cellular migration and intercellular communication. This multifaceted regulatory capacity positions TXK as a particularly attractive target for immunotherapeutic interventions aimed at modulating both biochemical signaling pathways and the biophysical properties of immune cells.  \nOverall, TXK continues to be an active subject of investigation in the fields of immunology and cancer biology. As our understanding of its structure–function relationships deepens, there is considerable potential for the development of next-generation therapeutics that exploit its unique regulatory features to correct aberrant immune signaling. The continued integration of phylogenetic, structural, and biochemical data will be essential for translating these insights into clinically effective strategies for diseases where T-cell signaling is disrupted.\n\n## 9.

    "answer": "1. Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase FRK (also known as Fyn‐related kinase, PTK5, or RAK) is unequivocally classified as a member of the Src family of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases. This family, marked by a conserved modular structure that includes SH3 and SH2 domains in addition to the catalytic kinase domain, shares a common evolutionary origin rooted in early vertebrate gene duplication events. FRK shows significant sequence homology to other well‐established Src family members such as BLK, FYN, LYN, and SRC, all of which arose from a common ancestral Src kinase. Notably, while many Src family kinases are classically involved in membrane‐oriented signaling cascades, FRK exhibits distinctive nuclear localization, implying a divergent functional evolution where it primarily modulates nuclear signaling events, including transcriptional regulation and cell cycle progression. Phylogenetic reconstructions based on kinome profiling have revealed that the catalytic and regulatory modules (SH3, SH2, and kinase domains) of FRK are well conserved across a broad spectrum of vertebrates, indicating the presence of FRK orthologs in many mammalian species as well as in other chordates (alexander2015theconciseguide pages 10-13, alexander2017theconciseguide pages 8-11, vasUnknownyearbalázsmerő1lászló pages 19-20).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nFRK catalyzes the transfer of the γ‐phosphate from ATP to a specific tyrosine residue on its substrate proteins in a reaction that typifies the mechanism of tyrosine phosphorylation. The general chemical reaction can be summarized as: ATP + [protein]-OH → ADP + [protein]-OPO₃²⁻ + H⁺. A particularly well‐characterized substrate for FRK is the tumor suppressor protein PTEN, where FRK phosphorylates PTEN specifically on Tyr-336. This phosphorylation event plays a crucial role in stabilizing PTEN by reducing its affinity for the ubiquitin ligase NEDD4, thereby mitigating its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Although the complete atomic-level mechanism and transition state geometry have not been fully delineated in the available literature, FRK clearly adheres to the canonical phosphotransfer mechanism observed in Src family kinases, ensuring precise substrate modification that ultimately regulates cell proliferation (alexander2015theconciseguide pages 10-13, organ2014cmetandkrasc pages 76-79).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of FRK is dependent on essential cofactors that facilitate the efficient transfer of the phosphate moiety. Like other protein kinases, FRK utilizes ATP as its phosphate donor. In addition, its activity critically depends on the presence of divalent metal ions, particularly Mg²⁺. The magnesium ion serves to coordinate the phosphate groups of ATP, thereby stabilizing the nucleotide within the active site and lowering the activation energy required for the phosphotransfer reaction. This ion not only assists in neutralizing the negative charges of the phosphate groups but also participates in the proper orientation of both the ATP and the substrate within the kinase catalytic cleft. Although some kinases may use alternative divalent cations such as Mn²⁺ under atypical conditions, Mg²⁺ is the principal and physiologically relevant cofactor for FRK (alexander2015theconciseguide pages 10-13).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nFRK displays substrate specificity that is emblematic of Src family tyrosine kinases. The kinase exhibits a marked preference for phosphorylating specific tyrosine residues on target proteins that play critical roles in cell signaling and growth regulation. One of the best-documented physiological substrates of FRK is PTEN. FRK-mediated phosphorylation of PTEN occurs at the Tyr-336 residue, a modification that is pivotal for preventing PTEN’s degradation by thwarting its interaction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4. Although explicit consensus substrate motifs for FRK have not been exhaustively characterized, it is generally surmised that FRK, by virtue of its membership in the Src kinase family, recognizes and binds to target sequences that are flanked by specific amino acids which contribute to optimal docking within its catalytic pocket. Such substrate motifs are typically governed by the interplay of adjacent regions that dock into the SH3 and SH2 domains, thereby positioning the target tyrosine appropriately for phosphorylation. This selectivity underpins FRK’s role as a pivotal regulator of cellular proliferation through its selective modification of substrates such as PTEN (organ2014cmetandkrasc pages 76-79, joyce2022analysisofakt1b pages 125-128).\n\n5. Structure  \nThe domain organization of FRK follows the canonical framework of Src family kinases while simultaneously exhibiting unique characteristics that reflect its specialized functions. The N-terminal region of FRK encompasses sequences that contribute to its nuclear localization; this feature distinguishes FRK from typical Src family kinases, which are predominantly cytoplasmic or associated with the plasma membrane. Immediately following the N-terminus, FRK contains an SH3 domain that mediates protein–protein interactions, typically binding to proline-rich motifs. This SH3 domain is also subject to regulatory phosphorylation; for instance, phosphorylation at a conserved tyrosine residue (often referenced as Y46) is thought to induce “SH3 domain displacement,” thereby relieving autoinhibitory interactions and promoting catalytic activation. Adjacent to the SH3 domain lies the SH2 domain, which binds phosphotyrosine-containing motifs in interacting proteins or within inhibitory regulatory regions. At the core, FRK houses the kinase catalytic domain, which is structured as a bilobal entity with an N-terminal lobe (responsible for binding ATP) and a larger C-terminal lobe (which facilitates substrate binding and catalysis). Although a high-resolution crystal structure of full-length FRK is not explicitly available in the current literature, homology models based on related Src family kinases indicate the presence of conserved catalytic residues, including the lysine critical for ATP binding and the aspartate of the DFG motif that is essential for catalysis. Together, these domains ensure that FRK is capable of integrating regulatory signals via intramolecular interactions and external protein binding events, which modulate its kinase activity in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (alexander2015theconciseguide pages 10-13, laszlo2019structuralinsightsinto pages 19-21, alexander2017theconciseguide pages 8-11).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe activity of FRK is meticulously modulated by an array of post-translational modifications and by its subcellular localization, which together ensure precise control over its function as a negative regulator of cell proliferation. A key regulatory mechanism involves the phosphorylation of FRK itself on specific tyrosine residues within its regulatory domains. For example, phosphorylation of the SH3 domain residue—commonly reported as Y46—has been implicated in a process known as “SH3 domain displacement.” This displacement is thought to disrupt inhibitory intramolecular contacts, thereby activating the kinase. In addition to autophosphorylation events, FRK exerts regulatory control over downstream signaling pathways by phosphorylating substrates such as PTEN. By targeting PTEN at Tyr-336, FRK effectively stabilizes PTEN protein levels within the cell by reducing its binding affinity for the ubiquitin ligase NEDD4, which is responsible for marking PTEN for degradation. This dual regulation—both auto-regulation via phosphorylation of its own regulatory domains and heterologous regulation through substrate modification—ensures that FRK activity is tightly coupled to the control of cellular proliferation. Although the specific phosphatases that might dephosphorylate FRK are less well-defined in the current context, it is clear that the dynamic balance between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is essential for maintaining appropriate FRK activity. Moreover, nuclear import and export signals may further modulate its localization and access to substrates, underscoring the complexity of its regulation (organ2014cmetandkrasc pages 76-79, laszlo2019structuralinsightsinto pages 19-21).\n\n7. Function  \nFunctionally, FRK serves as an important non-receptor tyrosine kinase that exerts a negative regulatory control on cell proliferation. Central to its tumor suppressor activity is its ability to enhance the stability of the tumor suppressor PTEN. By phosphorylating PTEN at Tyr-336, FRK reduces PTEN’s association with the ubiquitin ligase NEDD4, thereby decreasing PTEN ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Sustained PTEN levels ensure that the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, a major driver of cell proliferation and survival, remains properly regulated. Beyond its role in PTEN stabilization, FRK’s nuclear localization suggests that it may also participate in the regulation of transcriptional programs and cell cycle progression, thereby contributing further to growth inhibition. Additionally, phosphoproteomic studies in colorectal cancer models have implicated FRK in c-MET signaling pathways, where alterations in FRK phosphorylation status correlate with changes in cellular adhesiveness and motility. Thus, FRK functions as an essential checkpoint in cell signaling networks, integrating multiple regulatory inputs to maintain cellular homeostasis and suppress oncogenic transformation (organ2014cmetandkrasc pages 76-79, joyce2022analysisofakt1b pages 125-128, alexander2015theconciseguide pages 10-13).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nDespite its defined role in modulating cell proliferation and tumor suppression, FRK remains less extensively characterized compared to some of its Src family counterparts. Currently, there are no inhibitors that have been designed exclusively to target FRK; rather, available small-molecule inhibitors tend to affect a broad spectrum of Src family kinases. This lack of specificity underscores an active area of research aimed at developing highly selective inhibitors that can dissect FRK’s nuclear functions from its cytoplasmic relatives. Moreover, given FRK’s critical role in sustaining PTEN stability—a factor that is often disrupted in cancer—ongoing investigations are focused on exploring the potential of FRK as a therapeutic target, particularly in tumors characterized by PTEN loss or dysfunction. Active research is also directed towards identifying additional substrates and regulatory phosphorylation sites that might extend our understanding of FRK’s biological functions. Notable efforts include integrative annotation studies and kinome mapping approaches that strive to consolidate information on kinase post-translational modifications and cancer-associated mutations. Such studies promise to elucidate the broader landscape of FRK’s involvement in oncogenic signaling networks and may reveal novel opportunities for targeted interventions in oncology (organ2014cmetandkrasc pages 76-79, diop2022sh2domainsfolding pages 5-6).\n\n9.

    "answer": "1. Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase Fgr is a member of the Src family kinases (SFKs), a well‐defined subgroup of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases conserved from invertebrates to vertebrates. Fgr shares extensive sequence and structural homology with classical SFK members such as Src, Fyn, Yes, Lyn, Hck, Blk, and Lck. Within the mammalian kinome, Fgr is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells and is phylogenetically classified among kinases that are critical regulators of immune responses. Its evolutionary conservation is evident across multiple species – orthologous sequences have been identified in common model organisms, which supports the notion that Fgr evolved from an ancestral SFK present in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) (santos2016paralogspecificpatternsof pages 1-1, sekar2023kinaceaweb pages 14-17, shen2018thesrcfamily pages 10-11, patel2019srcfamilykinasesimpact pages 68-73).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nFgr catalyzes the transfer of the γ‐phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to tyrosine residues within target protein substrates. In this reaction mechanism, ATP is converted into adenosine diphosphate (ADP) while a hydroxyl group (–OH) on a substrate tyrosine performs a nucleophilic attack on the γ‐phosphate of ATP, forming a phosphotyrosine residue. This phosphorylation event is a key post‐translational modification that regulates protein activity, subcellular localization, and interactions, thereby triggering downstream signaling cascades critical for immune cell activation and cytoskeletal reorganization (eshaq2024nonreceptortyrosinekinases pages 2-4, shen2018thesrcfamily pages 8-9, weir2018selectiveinhibitionof pages 1-4).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of Fgr is dependent upon divalent metal ions, with Mg²⁺ serving as the primary cofactor. Mg²⁺ is essential as it coordinates with ATP in the kinase active site, stabilizing the molecule and neutralizing the negative charges on the phosphate groups, thereby facilitating efficient phosphotransfer. Although in some kinase systems substitution with Mn²⁺ has been observed under specific conditions, the biochemical characterization of SFKs such as Fgr overwhelmingly indicates that optimal Fgr activity requires Mg²⁺. This cofactor dependency aligns with the general property of tyrosine kinases, where coordination of ATP by a divalent metal ion is critical for catalysis (du2022atpsiteinhibitorsinduce pages 1-3, patel2019srcfamilykinasesimpact pages 68-73, eshaq2024nonreceptortyrosinekinases pages 2-4).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nFgr phosphorylates an array of substrates that are centrally involved in immune receptor signaling and cytoskeletal regulation. A key substrate is Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), phosphorylation of which by Fgr in vitro has been shown to promote activation of downstream signaling involving AKT1 and the MAP kinase cascade. In mast cells Fgr phosphorylates phospholipase D2 (PLD2), leading to the production of critical lipid mediators such as lysophosphatidic acid and diacylglycerol. Other noteworthy substrates include the FAS ligand (FASLG), where phosphorylation affects its ubiquitination and subsequent internalization, as well as ABL1, and adaptor proteins such as CBL and cortactin (CTTN). Furthermore, Fgr phosphorylates key components of integrin-mediated signaling pathways including the PI3K regulatory subunit (PIK3R1) and the focal adhesion kinases PTK2 (FAK1) and PTK2B (PYK2). VAV2 and HCLS1 are additional substrates, with the latter being phosphorylated only when pre-modified by SYK. Although there is no single consensus phosphorylation motif defined for Fgr analogous to motifs recognized by serine/threonine kinases, substrate specificity is mediated in part by protein–protein interactions through its SH2 and SH3 domains. These domains either recognize phosphotyrosine residues or bind proline-rich sequences that are present on target proteins, thereby directing Fgr to its appropriate substrates (abe2019gainoffunctionmutationsin pages 1-1, ciapala2017thesrcfamilykinase pages 90-93, patel2019srcfamilykinasesimpact pages 73-77, du2022atpsiteinhibitorsinduce pages 3-5, patel2019srcfamilykinasesimpacta pages 73-77).\n\n5. Structure  \nFgr exhibits the canonical domain organization that is characteristic of Src family kinases. At the N-terminus, it possesses an SH4 domain responsible for membrane anchorage via lipid modifications such as myristoylation and possibly palmitoylation. This membrane-targeting process is crucial for positioning Fgr in close proximity to its receptor substrates (gormal2024locationlocationlocation pages 18-19). Next, Fgr contains a Unique region whose sequence diverges considerably from its SFK relatives; this region may contribute to differential protein–protein interactions, although its precise function is less well characterized. Continuing along the polypeptide chain is the SH3 domain, a small module that recognizes proline-rich motifs in partner proteins and participates in both intramolecular and intermolecular interactions that can influence the kinase’s conformation. Adjacent to the SH3 domain is the SH2 domain, which specifically binds phosphotyrosine-containing sequences; this domain plays a central role in both substrate recognition and the autoregulatory mechanism by interacting with a phosphorylated tyrosine in the C-terminal tail in many SFKs. Central to the structure is the catalytic kinase domain (SH1), a bilobed structure composed of N- and C-terminal lobes that form the ATP binding site and the substrate binding cleft. Within this kinase domain resides an activation loop, which in Fgr is noted for having unique features, such as an atypical amino acid substitution near the critical autophosphorylation site analogous to Tyr416 in Src. This distinct activation loop is associated with a higher basal kinase activity compared to other SFKs and is implicated in Fgr’s potent transforming ability (shen2018thesrcfamily pages 10-11, ciapala2017thesrcfamilykinase pages 26-30, du2022atpsiteinhibitorsinduce pages 3-5). In addition, Fgr contains a short C-terminal tail harboring a regulatory tyrosine residue; in many Src kinases, phosphorylation of this residue (equivalent to Tyr527 in Src) mediates autoinhibition by engaging the SH2 domain. However, in Fgr the presence of this phosphorylated tail does not result in classical inhibitory interactions, contributing further to its relatively high basal activity. Although full-length high-resolution crystallographic structures of Fgr remain limited, hydrogen–deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) studies confirm that its overall fold is similar to other SFKs, while significant displacements in the SH3–SH2 regulatory module imply a divergence in autoinhibitory control and substrate accessibility (bagnato2020nuclearfunctionsof pages 1-3, shen2018thesrcfamily pages 5-6, passannanti2021applicationofcomputational pages 14-17, kinoshitakikuta2022characterizationofphosphorylation pages 10-11).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulatory mechanisms governing Fgr are multifactorial and involve phosphorylation dynamics, conformational rearrangements, and protein–protein interactions mediated by its modular domains. Activation of Fgr critically depends on autophosphorylation of a tyrosine residue within the activation loop (analogous to Tyr416 in Src), which facilitates a shift toward an active kinase conformation. In many Src family kinases, a conserved tyrosine residue in the C-terminal tail (comparable to Tyr527 in Src) is phosphorylated by C-terminal Src kinase (CSK), triggering an intramolecular interaction with the SH2 domain and enforcing an inactive “closed” conformation. In contrast, although Fgr is phosphorylated on its C-terminal tail, several studies have demonstrated that this phosphorylation does not effectively suppress its kinase activity. Fgr’s activation loop possesses a unique amino acid motif – including a proline residue at the +2 position relative to the activation loop tyrosine – that contributes to its elevated basal activity and attenuates classical SH3-SH2-mediated autoinhibition. Mutational studies have shown that substituting Fgr’s activation loop with that of Src reduces both kinase activity and transformative ability, underscoring the importance of this region in dictating its regulatory behavior (shen2018thesrcfamily pages 1-2, shen2018thesrcfamily pages 10-11, shu2025constitutiveactivationof pages 1-2).  \nFurthermore, regulatory inputs in Fgr are modulated by intermolecular interactions with adaptor proteins and may be influenced by the binding of ATP-site inhibitors. For instance, small molecules such as A-419259 and TL02-59 have been reported to induce allosteric shifts in Fgr’s conformation, resulting in altered exposure of the SH3 and SH2 domains and influencing overall kinase activity (du2022atpsiteinhibitorsinduce pages 11-13, weir2018selectiveinhibitionof pages 8-11). These studies collectively suggest that Fgr functions with a regulatory scheme that is partly independent of the canonical SH3/SH2 autoinhibitory interaction prevalent in other Src family members, enabling sustained activity that might underpin its oncogenic potential in certain hematopoietic contexts.\n\n7. Function  \nFgr is intimately involved in the regulation of immune signaling. It transmits signals from cell surface receptors lacking intrinsic kinase activity – notably receptors binding the Fc portion of immunoglobulins such as MS4A2/FCER1B, FCGR2A, and FCGR2B, as well as integrins ITGB1 and ITGB2. In immune cells including neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and mast cells, Fgr regulates critical processes such as cytoskeletal reorganization, cell adhesion, migration, spreading, and phagocytosis. These functions are essential for an effective immune response and include both activating and inhibitory roles.  \nIn mast cells, for example, upon antigen stimulation, Fgr phosphorylates PLD2, which catalyzes the production of lipid signaling molecules (lysophosphatidic acid and diacylglycerol) that drive degranulation and the release of inflammatory cytokines, thereby playing a role in IgE-mediated anaphylaxis. In parallel, Fgr phosphorylates SYK – a key kinase in immune receptor signaling – to initiate downstream activation of AKT1 and MAP kinase pathways, which are essential for cell migration and survival. Beyond its role in promoting activation, Fgr has been shown to act as a negative regulator in specific contexts, as it modulates ITGB2 signaling and phagocytic activity in monocytes. In contrast, in neutrophils and macrophages, Fgr is required for proper integrin-mediated signaling essential for normal adhesion and spreading (abe2019gainoffunctionmutationsin pages 1-1, du2022atpsiteinhibitorsinduce pages 6-8, patel2019srcfamilykinasesimpact pages 73-77).  \nAdditionally, Fgr phosphorylates FASLG, thereby influencing its ubiquitination and subsequent internalization, which may affect the balance between activation and apoptosis in immune cells. The kinase also contributes to focal adhesion dynamics through the phosphorylation of ABL1, CBL, cortactin (CTTN), and focal adhesion kinases such as PTK2/FAK1 and PTK2B/PYK2, while also engaging with VAV2 and HCLS1 (the latter being phosphorylated only when previously modified by SYK). Moreover, in partnership with the adaptor protein CLNK, Fgr serves as a negative regulator of natural killer cell activating receptors and suppresses interferon‐γ production, thereby fine-tuning the immune response (ciapala2017thesrcfamilykinase pages 90-93, shen2018thesrcfamily pages 8-9, eshaq2024nonreceptortyrosinekinases pages 20-21).  \nClinically, aberrant expression and constitutive activation of Fgr have been implicated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where overexpression contributes to cytokine-independent proliferation and survival of leukemic cells. The transforming potential of Fgr has been demonstrated in fibroblast transformation assays, and RNA interference studies in primary AML cells have underscored its importance in leukemic proliferation, making it a promising target for therapeutic intervention (shen2018thesrcfamily pages 1-2, patel2019srcfamilykinasesimpact pages 73-77, shu2025constitutiveactivationof pages 1-2).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSelective inhibition of Fgr is a current focus of research, particularly given its dual role in both immune activation and suppression, and its emerging importance in hematopoietic malignancies such as AML. ATP-site inhibitors like A-419259 and TL02-59 have been shown in preclinical models to inhibit Fgr autophosphorylation and downstream signaling pathways that modulate cell adhesion, migration, and cytokine production (du2022atpsiteinhibitorsinduce pages 14-18, weir2018selectiveinhibitionof pages 8-11). Such compounds not only suppress the proliferation of leukemic cells but also alter immune cell functions, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting Fgr specifically.  \nIn addition, the unique regulatory features of Fgr – particularly its relative insensitivity to classical SH3–SH2 mediated autoinhibition due to a distinctive activation loop – make it an attractive candidate for the development of inhibitors that can selectively target Fgr without significantly affecting other SFK members. This selectivity is important to limit off-target effects, given the broad expression and critical physiological roles of other Src family kinases in non-hematopoietic tissues.  \nCurrent research efforts are focused on further elucidating the three-dimensional structure of full-length Fgr, mapping its complete substrate repertoire, and defining the contributions of post-translational modifications to its function in different cellular contexts. New technological approaches, such as deep learning-coupled proximity assays and advanced HDX-MS techniques, are being employed to capture the dynamic regulatory conformations of Fgr, which in turn may inform the design of next-generation, highly selective inhibitors (jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 24-26, amatya2019dynamicregulatoryfeatures pages 1-3, passannanti2021applicationofcomputational pages 14-17).  \nFurthermore, Fgr’s contrasting roles – serving as a positive regulator in integrin-mediated signaling in neutrophils and macrophages while acting as a negative regulator in monocytes – underscore the complexity of its function in immune homeostasis and inflammation. These context-dependent activities provide valuable insights into how modulation of Fgr activity can be leveraged to treat diverse pathologies ranging from inflammatory disorders to hematologic cancers (eshaq2024nonreceptortyrosinekinases pages 20-21, bagnato2020nuclearfunctionsof pages 1-3, shen2018thesrcfamily pages 10-11).  \nThere is also considerable interest in using Fgr expression levels as a biomarker for immune cell lineage specification and for predicting responsiveness to targeted kinase inhibition in AML. As further studies define the molecular determinants of its substrate interactions and inhibitor binding, it is anticipated that more potent and selective Fgr inhibitors will enter clinical evaluation, potentially in combination with other therapies aiming at dysregulated signaling networks in leukemogenesis (du2022atpsiteinhibitorsinduce pages 14-18, passannanti2021applicationofcomputational pages 17-21).\n\n9.

    "answer": "## 1. Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase Fyn is a member of the Src family kinases (SFKs), a subgroup of non‐receptor protein tyrosine kinases whose evolutionary origins date back to early metazoans, reflecting an ancient and highly conserved signaling module present in all vertebrates and many invertebrates (barritt2017fynmediatedregulationof pages 1-6). Fyn shares extensive sequence and structural homology with other well‐characterized SFKs such as c‐Src, Yes, Lyn, and Lck, all of which derive from a common ancestral kinase that predates the divergence of major multicellular lineages (corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 13-16). Comparative genomic analyses have identified Fyn orthologs across a wide range of species—from mammals and birds to amphibians and fish—underscoring its essential functions in cell signaling and highlighting its evolutionary conservation (khalaf2016acentralnervous pages 16-17). In the broad classification of the human kinome, Fyn is positioned within the tyrosine kinase group, specifically among the Src family members that share a distinctive modular organization with conserved regulatory and catalytic domains (barritt2017fynmediatedregulationof pages 1-6). Phylogenetic studies have demonstrated that the emergence of Fyn and its related kinases was a pivotal event in the evolution of intracellular signal transduction pathways, as these proteins are now central hubs that modulate a diverse array of cellular processes in both the immune and nervous systems (khalaf2016acentralnervous pages 2-4).\n\n## 2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nFyn catalyzes an ATP‐dependent phosphorylation reaction in which it transfers the γ‐phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of specific tyrosine residues on its substrate proteins (barritt2017fynmediatedregulationof pages 1-6). In this reaction the substrates—which include key regulatory proteins involved in cell adhesion, cytoskeletal remodeling, and receptor signaling—are modified to form phosphotyrosine residues, while ATP is hydrolyzed to yield ADP and inorganic phosphate along with a proton (corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 90-94). The phosphorylation reaction that Fyn mediates is a classic post–translational modification employed by tyrosine kinases to regulate protein function, as the addition of a phosphate moiety can induce conformational changes, affect protein–protein interactions, or modulate subcellular localization (barritt2017fynmediatedregulationof pages 1-6). The reaction mechanism itself is thought to follow the common ATP-dependent nucleophilic substitution pathway observed in many kinases, whereby the substrate’s tyrosine hydroxyl group acts as a nucleophile that attacks the γ–phosphate of ATP, resulting in the formation of a phosphotyrosine residue on the substrate (corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 90-94). This process is central to the activation of numerous downstream signaling cascades that govern essential cellular processes such as adhesion, migration, immune cell activation, and neural development (barritt2017fynmediatedregulationof pages 31-41).\n\n## 3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of Fyn is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions, with magnesium (Mg²⁺) being the primary essential cofactor required for its kinase activity (barritt2017fynmediatedregulationof pages 1-6). Mg²⁺ coordinates with the phosphate groups of ATP within the active site of the kinase, thereby facilitating the proper alignment and stabilization of ATP for efficient phosphate transfer to the substrate tyrosine residues (corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 79-82). Although some kinases may utilize other divalent metal ions, such as manganese (Mn²⁺), the literature consistently attributes Fyn’s enzymatic function to a reliance on Mg²⁺, and no additional cofactors or specialized regulatory molecules have been definitively shown to be required for its intrinsic catalytic activity (barritt2017fynmediatedregulationof pages 1-6). This requirement not only underscores the fundamental mechanistic commonality shared among protein kinases, but it also provides a basis for potential pharmacological intervention strategies that target the metal-ion coordination environment in the Fyn active site (corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 79-82).\n\n## 4. Substrate Specificity  \nFyn exhibits a broad substrate specificity and plays a pivotal role in phosphorylating a diverse set of proteins that are critical for numerous cellular functions. Among its well‐documented physiological targets are:  \n • **Adhesion proteins:** Fyn phosphorylates beta‐catenin (CTNNB1) and delta‐catenin (CTNND1), proteins that are essential for the assembly and maintenance of intercellular junctions and that modulate cell migration by influencing adherens junction stability (barritt2017fynmediatedregulationof pages 1-6, gerbec2015thefyn–adapaxis pages 1-2).  \n • **Cytoskeletal regulators:** Fyn targets the actin regulatory protein WAS and microtubule-associated proteins such as MAP2 and MAPT, which play central roles in cytoskeletal reorganization required for cell mobility and morphogenesis (barritt2017fynmediatedregulationof pages 1-6, corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 152-155).  \n • **Survival and anti-apoptotic factors:** By phosphorylating AGAP2/PIKE-A, Fyn prevents its cleavage by apoptotic proteases, thereby promoting cell survival under stress conditions or in the presence of proliferative signals (barritt2017fynmediatedregulationof pages 1-6, corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 79-82).  \n • **Kidney slit diaphragm components:** Fyn has been shown to phosphorylate proteins such as NPHS1, KIRREL1, and TRPC6, which are crucial for maintaining the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier in the kidney (barritt2017fynmediatedregulationof pages 1-6, corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 90-94).  \n • **Neural proteins:** In the central nervous system, Fyn phosphorylates adapter proteins like DPYSL2 and regulators such as ARHGAP32, as well as synaptic proteins, including SNCA, thereby influencing axon guidance, synaptic plasticity, and overall neuronal signaling (barritt2017fynmediatedregulationof pages 1-6, matrone2020fyntyrosinekinase pages 12-14).  \n • **Immune signaling molecules:** Fyn is integral to T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling, phosphorylating proteins such as PTK2B/PYK2 and adapter molecules like PAG1; it further promotes CD28-induced phosphorylation events such as those occurring on VAV1 and also phosphorylates CLNK in mast cells, thereby modulating various aspects of immune cell activation and regulation (barritt2017fynmediatedregulationof pages 31-41, gerbec2015thefyn–adapaxis pages 4-5).  \n\nFyn’s substrate recognition does not seem to rely on a single linear consensus motif; rather, its specificity is influenced by the spatial context of target residues and is augmented by the interactions of its SH2 and SH3 domains with phosphotyrosine- and proline-rich sequences in substrates, respectively (iqbal2018identificationofphosphorylation pages 1-5, li2023highthroughputprofilingof pages 31-32). This multivalent mode of target recognition enables Fyn to function effectively in complex cellular environments, ensuring rapid and localized phosphorylation of substrates that regulate diverse biochemical pathways.\n\n## 5. Structure  \nFyn exhibits a modular structure that is emblematic of the Src family kinases, composed of several distinct domains with specialized functions:  \n • **N-terminal SH4 domain:** This short segment, located at the extreme N-terminus, contains signals for lipid modifications, including myristoylation and palmitoylation, which direct the protein to the plasma membrane and subcellular lipid-rich microdomains (matrone2020fyntyrosinekinase pages 1-3, gerbec2015thefyn–adapaxis pages 1-2).  \n • **Unique domain:** Situated immediately after the SH4 region, the unique domain is less conserved and confers isoform-specific interactions that can fine-tune subcellular localization and substrate specificity; although its precise functions are not fully elucidated, it plays a role in distinguishing Fyn’s activity in different cellular contexts (matrone2020fyntyrosinekinase pages 1-3).  \n • **SH3 domain:** The SH3 domain typically binds to proline-rich sequences in target proteins and in intramolecular interactions that contribute to the maintenance of an autoinhibited state under basal conditions (barritt2017fynmediatedregulationof pages 6-10, corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 146-149).  \n • **SH2 domain:** This module binds to phosphorylated tyrosine residues within specific sequence contexts; such binding not only facilitates the recruitment of substrates and regulatory proteins but also reinforces signal specificity by tethering Fyn near its targets (barritt2017fynmediatedregulationof pages 6-10, corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 97-100).  \n • **Catalytic (SH1) domain:** Central to Fyn’s enzymatic activity, the SH1 domain exhibits a typical bilobal structure with an N-terminal lobe that largely consists of β-sheets and a C-terminal lobe rich in α-helices. Within this domain, a critical activation loop contains key tyrosine residues—phosphorylation at these sites, such as at Tyr420 in human Fyn, is essential for full enzymatic activation (koc2017fynkinaseregulates pages 21-31, corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 90-94).  \n • **C-terminal regulatory tail:** This region harbors a key inhibitory tyrosine residue (commonly Tyr531 in human Fyn) whose phosphorylation promotes an intramolecular interaction with the SH2 domain, thereby stabilizing the inactive conformation of the kinase (barritt2017fynmediatedregulationof pages 6-10, matrone2020fyntyrosinekinase pages 14-16).  \n\nStructural studies, including crystallography and advanced prediction methods such as those employed by AlphaFold, have confirmed that the overall fold of Fyn is highly conserved within the SFK family, with dynamic conformational changes driven by alterations in phosphorylation states that regulate the opening and closing of the catalytic site (koc2017fynkinaseregulates pages 1-6, li2023highthroughputprofilingof pages 31-32). These high-resolution structural insights have been fundamental in elucidating the mechanisms by which Fyn shifts between its autoinhibited and active states.\n\n## 6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of Fyn kinase is multifaceted, involving an interplay of phosphorylation events, protein–protein interactions, and feedback mechanisms that finely tune its activity. Key aspects of its regulatory control include:  \n • **C-terminal tail phosphorylation:** Under basal conditions, Fyn is maintained in an autoinhibited conformation by phosphorylation of a critical tyrosine residue in its C-terminal tail (commonly Tyr531). This phosphorylated tyrosine interacts intramolecularly with the SH2 domain, thereby blocking access to the active site and preventing substrate phosphorylation (barritt2017fynmediatedregulationof pages 6-10, gerbec2015thefyn–adapaxis pages 4-5).  \n • **Activation loop phosphorylation and dephosphorylation dynamics:** Activation of Fyn is triggered by the dephosphorylation of the inhibitory C-terminal tail coupled with phosphorylation events on the activation loop. In particular, phosphorylation at a tyrosine residue within the kinase domain (such as Tyr420) facilitates a conformational change that enables enhanced ATP and substrate binding, thus fully activating the kinase. Upstream kinases such as protein kinase A (PKA) have been implicated in promoting these activating phosphorylation events, which also support the association of Fyn with focal adhesion components like PTK2/FAK1 (barritt2017fynmediatedregulationof pages 31-41, corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 152-155).  \n • **Regulation by protein–protein interactions:** The SH2 and SH3 domains of Fyn play dual regulatory roles by mediating interactions with both substrates and regulatory proteins. Binding of proline-rich ligands to the SH3 domain or phosphotyrosine motifs to the SH2 domain can induce conformational rearrangements that relieve the autoinhibited state, thereby enhancing kinase activity. For instance, the association of Fyn with the adaptor protein PAG1 enables the recruitment of C-terminal Src kinase (CSK), which phosphorylates Fyn at its inhibitory C-terminal site, establishing a negative feedback mechanism (gerbec2015thefyn–adapaxis pages 4-5, corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 97-100).  \n • **Feedback mechanisms and scaffold-mediated control:** Beyond direct phosphorylation, Fyn is subject to regulatory feedback loops that involve the phosphorylation of downstream signaling adaptors. This not only ensures that aberrant or prolonged signaling is curtailed but also reinforces compartmentalized regulation. For example, Fyn-mediated phosphorylation of PAG1 creates a docking site for CSK, which in turn helps to maintain Fyn (and related kinases such as Lck) in a quiescent state through further inhibitory phosphorylation (gerbec2015thefyn–adapaxis pages 4-5, corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 97-100).  \n • **Additional post–translational modifications:** Although phosphorylation is the most prominent modification regulating Fyn, other modifications such as ubiquitination may also influence its cellular half-life and subcellular localization, particularly under pathological or stress conditions. Such modifications, while less well characterized in the literature for Fyn specifically, add an additional layer to the precise control of its signaling output (demuro2021gsk3βfynand pages 4-5, matrone2020fyntyrosinekinase pages 12-14).  \n\nCollectively, these regulatory mechanisms ensure that Fyn activity is tightly controlled in response to extracellular cues, allowing it to serve as an integrator of signals from growth factor receptors, integrin engagements, and immune cell receptors while avoiding the deleterious effects of unrestrained tyrosine phosphorylation (koc2017fynkinaseregulates pages 1-6, li2023highthroughputprofilingof pages 31-32).\n\n## 7. Function  \nFyn is a multifunctional kinase whose activity is essential for the regulation of numerous biological processes across different tissues. Its functions span a wide range of cellular activities, including:  \n • **Regulation of cell growth and survival:** Fyn phosphorylates targets such as AGAP2/PIKE-A, which plays a central role in preventing apoptotic cleavage and promoting cell survival. This anti-apoptotic signaling is particularly important in contexts where cells must endure proliferative or stressful conditions (barritt2017fynmediatedregulationof pages 1-6, corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 79-82).  \n • **Cell adhesion and motility:** By targeting adhesion molecules such as beta-catenin (CTNNB1) and delta-catenin (CTNND1), Fyn directly influences the stability of cell–cell junctions and thereby modulates cell adhesion. Additionally, its phosphorylation of cytoskeletal regulators like WAS, MAP2, and MAPT orchestrates the reorganization of the cytoskeleton, which is vital for processes such as wound healing, tissue remodeling, and cell migration (barritt2017fynmediatedregulationof pages 1-6, gerbec2015thefyn–adapaxis pages 4-5).  \n • **Integrin-mediated signaling and focal adhesion dynamics:** Activation of Fyn by PKA leads to its association with focal adhesion kinase (PTK2/FAK1). This interaction triggers PTK2 phosphorylation and directs focal adhesion assembly, which is crucial for integrin-mediated cell migration, spreading, and survival (barritt2017fynmediatedregulationof pages 31-41, li2023highthroughputprofilingof pages 23-24).  \n • **Immune receptor signaling:** Fyn is intimately involved in T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling, where it phosphorylates a cascade of substrates including PTK2B/PYK2, thereby promoting T-cell differentiation and proliferation. In addition, its role in phosphorylating adapter proteins such as PAG1 establishes negative feedback loops that restrict T-cell activation, ensuring balanced immune responses (gerbec2015thefyn–adapaxis pages 1-2, barritt2017fynmediatedregulationof pages 31-41).  \n • **Neural development and synaptic function:** In neuronal cells, Fyn phosphorylates key regulators such as DPYSL2 and ARHGAP32, as well as synaptic proteins like SNCA, impacting axon guidance, synaptic plasticity, and reelin-mediated signaling via phosphorylation of DAB1. These events are critical for proper neuronal differentiation, network formation, and neural plasticity, processes that underlie learning and memory (matrone2020fyntyrosinekinase pages 12-14, barritt2017fynmediatedregulationof pages 1-6).  \n • **Regulation of kidney function:** Fyn’s phosphorylation of glomerular slit diaphragm components such as NPHS1, KIRREL1, and TRPC6 suggests a direct role in maintaining the integrity of the renal filtration barrier. In doing so, Fyn contributes to the precise regulation of kidney function and helps prevent pathologies associated with slit diaphragm dysfunction (corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 90-94, barritt2017fynmediatedregulationof pages 1-6).  \n\nThus, Fyn integrates extracellular signals from growth factors, adhesion receptors, and immune cell receptors to coordinate diverse intracellular responses that ultimately dictate cell fate, motility, survival, and differentiation, with critical implications for immune regulation, neural development, and tissue integrity (barritt2017fynmediatedregulationof pages 31-41, li2023highthroughputprofilingof pages 23-24).\n\n## 8. Other Comments  \nFyn is classified as a proto-oncogene, and its dysregulation is implicated in the progression and metastasis of various cancers such as those of the breast, prostate, and brain; hyperactivation of Fyn can lead to enhanced cell invasiveness and resistance to apoptosis (matrone2020fyntyrosinekinase pages 14-16, demuro2021gsk3βfynand pages 4-5). In the domain of neurodegenerative disease, Fyn has attracted considerable attention because of its involvement in pathways linked to Alzheimer’s disease; its interaction with amyloid-beta soluble oligomers, tau protein phosphorylation, and reelin signaling suggest that inappropriate Fyn activity may contribute to synaptic loss and neuroinflammation (demuro2021gsk3βfynand pages 4-5, matrone2020fyntyrosinekinase pages 12-14). In immune regulation, the role of Fyn in mediating T-cell receptor signaling and in establishing negative feedback loops via PAG1 and CSK makes it a promising target for modulating immune responses in autoimmune disorders and in the context of immunotherapy (gerbec2015thefyn–adapaxis pages 1-2, barritt2017fynmediatedregulationof pages 31-41).  \nMoreover, a growing body of research has explored the application of high-throughput peptide display technologies to elucidate Fyn’s substrate specificity and binding preferences, thereby opening new avenues for the rational design of selective Fyn inhibitors (iqbal2018identificationofphosphorylation pages 1-5, li2023highthroughputprofilingof pages 31-32). Inhibitors such as dasatinib, originally developed for cancer indications, have shown activity against Fyn, although achieving high selectivity remains a significant challenge due to the structural conservation among SFKs (marotta2022roleoffyn pages 1-1, matrone2020fyntyrosinekinase pages 14-16).  \nFurthermore, Fyn’s regulatory functions extend to the control of mitochondrial translation and cellular energy metabolism, as emerging evidence indicates that Fyn associates with and phosphorylates components of the mitochondrial ribosome, thereby influencing oxidative phosphorylation efficiency and energy production; these insights suggest potential links between Fyn activity, metabolic regulation, and conditions such as cardiomyopathy or metabolic disorders (koc2017fynkinaseregulates pages 21-31, corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 97-100).  \nGiven the multiplicity of its roles, Fyn continues to be a focus of active research, both for unraveling the detailed molecular mechanisms governing its activity and for developing therapeutic strategies that target its function in diseases marked by aberrant kinase signaling (marotta2022roleoffyn pages 18-18, li2023highthroughputprofilingof pages 23-24).\n\n## 9.

    "answer": "## 1. Phylogeny  \nProto‐oncogene tyrosine‐protein kinase Src (commonly referred to as c‐Src or pp60c‐src) belongs to the Src family kinases (SFKs), a subgroup of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases that form one of the major classes of protein kinases within the human kinome. Phylogenetic analyses have revealed that the catalytic core of Src, along with its key regulatory domains, is evolutionarily ancient and highly conserved. Orthologs of Src exist not only in all mammalian species but also in early diverging metazoans and even in some unicellular eukaryotes, suggesting that the fundamental role of Src in cell signaling was already established in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) (agius2019selectiveproteolysisto pages 7-8, bradley2019evolutionofprotein pages 1-2). Within the human kinome, Src is classified under the tyrosine kinase (TK) group. It possesses a high degree of sequence homology with other SFK members such as Fyn, Yes, Lyn, Lck, Hck, Fgr, and Blk, which explains why many of their substrate specificities and regulatory mechanisms overlap. Despite this apparent redundancy, Src is frequently cited as the primary kinase activated following receptor engagement across multiple pathways and cell types, and it participates in both shared and unique regulatory functions (amatya2019dynamicregulatoryfeatures pages 7-9, li2022srcfamilykinases pages 1-2). Comparative studies have shown that while the overall domain architecture is conserved among SFKs, subtle variations in the “unique” domain and in the regulatory sequences contribute to differences in their cellular localization and interaction partners. Such details not only underpin functional specialization but also indicate that Src emerged early in kinase evolution and continues to be subjected to strong evolutionary constraints that preserve its critical role in signal transduction.\n\n## 2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nSrc catalyzes the reversible transfer of the γ-phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to a specific hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring of a tyrosine residue in a protein substrate. Chemically, this reaction can be represented as:  \n  ATP + protein-(L-tyrosine) → ADP + protein-(phospho-L-tyrosine) + H⁺.  \nThis classical phosphorylation reaction is central to the regulation of protein function; by adding a phosphate group, Src alters the conformation, subcellular localization, and interaction affinity of its substrates. In the cellular context, receptor clustering or dimerization following ligand binding (to immune receptors, integrins, receptor tyrosine kinases, G protein-coupled receptors, or cytokine receptors) results in the recruitment of Src to these receptor complexes. Once localized at the membrane, Src phosphorylates tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domains of receptors as well as a host of downstream signaling proteins, thereby initiating or modulating an array of signaling cascades. This post-translational modification serves as a binary “on-off” switch for protein activity and interactions, and it is crucial for regulating processes such as gene transcription, actin cytoskeletal rearrangements, cell cycle progression, apoptotic regulation, and cellular transformation (mohanty2016hydrophobiccorevariations pages 21-23, chakraborty2019targetingdynamicatpbinding pages 9-10).\n\n## 3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of Src relies on the presence of divalent metal ions to properly coordinate nucleotide binding and catalysis. Magnesium ions (Mg²⁺) are required as the principal cofactor; they bind to ATP in the active site, stabilize the transition state, and ultimately facilitate the phosphoryl transfer to the tyrosine residue on the target protein. While manganese (Mn²⁺) can in some cases substitute for magnesium in biochemical assays, physiological Src activity is predominantly supported by Mg²⁺ (cabail2016autothiophosphorylationactivityof pages 10-10, li2022srcfamilykinases pages 1-2). In addition to metal ion cofactors, Src’s activity is modulated by a lipid-based regulatory mechanism: the N-terminal region of Src undergoes N-myristoylation, a post-translational modification in which a myristate group is covalently attached to the glycine residue at the extreme N-terminus. Although N-myristoylation is not considered a classical enzymatic cofactor, it is critical for anchoring Src to cellular membranes. This membrane association is essential for bringing Src into close proximity with receptor complexes and downstream substrates, thus indirectly contributing to optimal catalytic activity (chakraborty2019targetingdynamicatpbinding pages 9-10).\n\n## 4. Substrate Specificity  \nSrc displays broad substrate specificity that reflects its pivotal role in mediating diverse signal transduction events. Its catalytic activity is largely directed toward accessible tyrosine residues on proteins involved in processes such as cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and differentiation. The enzyme does not have a strict linear consensus sequence like some serine/threonine kinases; rather, its specificity is defined by both the immediate amino acid sequence surrounding the tyrosine residue and by the three-dimensional structure of the substrate which determines accessibility to the Src catalytic cleft.  \n\nAmong the best‐characterized substrates of Src are focal adhesion proteins, including focal adhesion kinase (PTK2/FAK1) and paxillin (PXN). Phosphorylation of these proteins links signals from integrin-mediated adhesion to the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, which is fundamental for cell mobility and dynamic changes at the cell–matrix interface (amatya2019dynamicregulatoryfeatures pages 7-9, gormal2024locationlocationlocation pages 18-19). Similarly, Src phosphorylates components of cell–cell junctions such as beta-catenin (CTNNB1), delta-catenin (CTNND1), and plakoglobin (JUP) that are essential for adherens junction stability, as well as gap junction proteins like connexin-43 (GJA1) which regulate intercellular communication.  \n\nIn addition, Src targets cytoskeletal adaptor proteins including AFAP1 and cortactin (CTTN). Phosphorylation of AFAP1 facilitates its binding to the SH2 domain of Src, promoting its localization along actin filaments and influencing cell shape and motility. Cortactin phosphorylation by Src is implicated in the formation of podosomes—actin-rich structures that contribute to invasive cell behavior (agius2019selectiveproteolysisto pages 7-8, joshi2020substratebindingto pages 1-4). Src also phosphorylates RNA-binding proteins such as KHDRBS1, linking its kinase activity to the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing and mRNA processing. Moreover, in the context of signal transduction cascades, Src phosphorylates transcription factors such as STAT1 and STAT3—often in response to PDGF signaling—as well as regulators of the RAS pathway like RASA1 and RASGRF1. Phosphorylation of the clathrin heavy chain (CLTC) by Src at tyrosine 1477 is a well-established modification that modulates epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) internalization (agius2019selectiveproteolysisto pages 7-8, johnson2023anatlasof pages 1-2).  \n\nAlthough no universal sequence motif has been defined for Src substrates, studies indicate that the local environment—a combination of flanking hydrophobic or acidic residues and the overall three‐dimensional conformation—is critical for substrate recognition. Once a substrate is phosphorylated, subsequent docking interactions with the Src SH2 domain can further stabilize the interaction, providing additional specificity to the phosphorylation event (joshi2020substratebindingto pages 11-15).\n\n## 5. Structure  \nSrc is organized as a modular protein whose structure underpins its multifaceted regulatory and catalytic functions. The protein architecture consists of several domains that are arranged from the N- to the C-terminus as follows:\n\n• **N-terminal SH4 Domain:**  \nAt the very N-terminus, Src contains an SH4 domain of approximately 15 amino acids, which is critical for membrane association. This region includes a conserved glycine residue that undergoes N-myristoylation—a lipid modification that permanently attaches a 14-carbon saturated fatty acid to Src. This modification is essential for targeting Src to the plasma membrane and intracellular vesicles, thereby positioning it in the correct locale for receptor-driven activation (li2022srcfamilykinases pages 1-2).\n\n• **Unique Domain:**  \nFollowing the SH4 domain is the unique domain. As its nomenclature implies, this region is variable among the SFK members and is intrinsically disordered. Despite its lack of fixed structure, the unique domain contributes to the fine-tuning of Src’s localization and may mediate specific protein–protein interactions that are key for differential substrate targeting. The functional diversity observed among SFKs is partly attributed to variability in this domain (chakraborty2019targetingdynamicatpbinding pages 9-10).\n\n• **SH3 Domain:**  \nThe SH3 domain is an approximately 60–amino acid domain that adopts a compact β-barrel fold. It primarily recognizes and binds to proline-rich motifs (PxxP sequences) in target proteins. This domain serves a dual function in Src: it facilitates the recognition of substrates possessing these motifs and, importantly, participates in the autoinhibition of the kinase when bound intramolecularly to the linker region connecting the SH2 and catalytic domains (joshi2020substratebindingto pages 15-17).\n\n• **SH2 Domain:**  \nActivated Src also harbors an SH2 domain of roughly 100 amino acids that specifically binds to phosphotyrosine-containing sequences. In the autoinhibited state, the SH2 domain interacts with the phosphorylated C-terminal tail (specifically at Tyr-530 in human Src), thereby locking the protein in a closed, inactive conformation. This intramolecular interaction is a cornerstone of Src regulation, ensuring that kinase activity is suppressed until appropriate extracellular signals are received (agius2019selectiveproteolysisto pages 7-8, joshi2020substratebindingto pages 15-17).\n\n• **Kinase Domain (SH1 Domain):**  \nCentral to Src’s enzymatic function lies the catalytic kinase domain, also known as the SH1 domain. This domain is structured into two lobes: a smaller N-terminal lobe that predominantly binds and positions ATP and a larger C-terminal lobe that forms the substrate-binding pocket. A highly conserved lysine residue within the N-lobe is crucial for coordinating the phosphate groups of ATP, while conserved aspartate residues aid in catalysis. The activation loop within this domain contains the critical Tyr-416, whose autophosphorylation is a prerequisite for full enzymatic activation (chakraborty2019targetingdynamicatpbinding pages 9-10, boczek2019autophosphorylationactivatescsrc pages 1-2).\n\n• **C-terminal Tail:**  \nThe C-terminal region of Src contains a short tail that includes a key regulatory tyrosine residue (Tyr-530 in human Src). When phosphorylated by the C-terminal Src kinase (CSK), Tyr-530 engages in an intramolecular interaction with the SH2 domain, enforcing an autoinhibited conformation that prevents open access to the activation loop and substrate-binding region. Dephosphorylation of Tyr-530 is an essential step that permits the kinase domain to adopt an active configuration through subsequent autophosphorylation events (joshi2020substratebindingto pages 15-17, gormal2024locationlocationlocation pages 18-19).\n\nHigh-resolution X-ray crystallography and recent computational models, including AlphaFold predictions, have provided detailed structural snapshots of both the inactive and active conformations of Src. These models have been instrumental in understanding the dynamic interplay between the regulatory domains and the catalytic core, revealing potential allosteric sites that may be exploited for selective inhibition (berndt2021newstructuralperspectives pages 1-2, joshi2020substratebindingto pages 15-17).\n\n## 6. Regulation  \nSrc activity is finely modulated by a highly interconnected network of regulatory mechanisms that ensure its activation is precisely coordinated with cellular signals. Several layers of regulation are involved:\n\n• **Phosphorylation-Dependent Regulation:**  \n – **Autoinhibitory Phosphorylation (Tyr-530):**  \n  Under basal conditions, Src is maintained in an autoinhibited state by phosphorylation of its C-terminal Tyr-530 by CSK. This phosphorylation induces an intramolecular binding of the phosphorylated tail to the SH2 domain, promoting a closed conformation that impedes substrate access to the catalytic site. This autoinhibitory mechanism is pivotal in preventing uncontrolled kinase activity (agius2019selectiveproteolysisto pages 7-8, kumar2015pharmacologyofsrc pages 4-7).  \n – **Activation via Autophosphorylation (Tyr-416):**  \n  Upon receptor stimulation and subsequent membrane recruitment, dephosphorylation of Tyr-530 occurs, allowing a conformational change in which the activation loop becomes accessible. Src then undergoes autophosphorylation at Tyr-416 within the kinase domain, a modification that realigns key catalytic residues and stabilizes the active conformation of the kinase (chakraborty2019targetingdynamicatpbinding pages 9-10, boczek2019autophosphorylationactivatescsrc pages 1-2).\n\n• **Intramolecular Domain Interactions:**  \nThe SH3 and SH2 domains not only mediate substrate interactions but are also critical for intramolecular regulatory binding. In the autoinhibited state, the SH3 domain binds to a proline‐rich linker between the SH2 and catalytic domains, further reinforcing the inactive configuration. Disruption of these interactions—by exogenous ligand binding, mutagenesis, or conformational shifts resulting from receptor engagement—can relieve autoinhibition and promote kinase activation (joshi2020substratebindingto pages 15-17).\n\n• **Receptor-Mediated Recruitment:**  \nEngagement of cell surface receptors such as integrins, receptor tyrosine kinases, and G protein-coupled receptors leads to clustering or dimerization events that recruit Src to the plasma membrane. This recruitment, facilitated by the myristoylated SH4 domain, increases the local concentration of Src near its substrates and can induce conformational changes that favor dephosphorylation of Tyr-530 and autophosphorylation of Tyr-416, effectively switching Src from an inactive to an active state (amatya2019dynamicregulatoryfeatures pages 7-9, gormal2024locationlocationlocation pages 18-19).\n\n• **Regulation by Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS):**  \nOxidative stress conditions modulate Src activity indirectly. For instance, ROS influences the phosphorylation status of junctional proteins such as PKP3. Phosphorylation of PKP3 at Tyr-195 in response to ROS can lead to its dissociation from desmosomes, which is part of a broader regulatory cascade that may alter Src localization and activity (agius2019selectiveproteolysisto pages 7-8).\n\n• **Adaptor and Scaffold Protein Interactions:**  \nSrc interacts with multiple adaptor proteins via its SH2 and SH3 domains. These interactions are essential for integrating signals from various receptors and for assembling multi-protein complexes that dictate the spatial and temporal dynamics of Src-mediated phosphorylation events. Such scaffolding functions not only modulate Src activity but also diversify its downstream signaling outcomes (kumar2015pharmacologyofsrc pages 21-24, joshi2020substratebindingto pages 15-17).\n\nThrough these combined regulatory layers, Src acts as a highly responsive molecular switch that can be rapidly turned on or off in response to extracellular cues. This precise regulation is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and for preventing aberrant signaling that might otherwise lead to pathological states (negi2021recentadvancesin pages 12-13, passannanti2021applicationofcomputational pages 111-114).\n\n## 7. Function  \nSrc is a central hub in cellular signaling and plays multifaceted roles in both normal physiology and disease conditions. Its functions span a vast range of biological processes, as detailed below:\n\n• **Signal Transduction:**  \nSrc is one of the earliest kinases activated following the stimulation of cell surface receptors. Upon receptor engagement and subsequent recruitment to the plasma membrane, Src phosphorylates tyrosine residues on the receptors and on key adaptor proteins. This early phosphorylation event sets into motion downstream signaling cascades, including the activation of MAPK pathways, the PI3K-Akt axis, and the regulation of transcription factors such as STATs. By integrating signals from diverse receptors, Src modulates a wide array of cellular responses including gene expression, cellular metabolism, and cytoskeletal rearrangements (agius2019selectiveproteolysisto pages 7-8, amatya2019dynamicregulatoryfeatures pages 7-9).\n\n• **Cytoskeletal Organization and Cell Adhesion:**  \nOne of the hallmark functions of Src is its regulation of the cytoskeleton. Src phosphorylates structural and adaptor proteins, such as AFAP1 and cortactin, which are central to the dynamic rearrangement of actin filaments. This regulation is vital for cellular processes such as migration, directional movement, and invasion. Furthermore, Src-mediated phosphorylation of focal adhesion components like FAK and paxillin not only influences cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix but also modulates the formation and turnover of focal adhesions. Similarly, by phosphorylating adherens and gap junction proteins (e.g., beta-catenin, delta-catenin, plakoglobin, and connexin-43), Src influences cell–cell adhesion dynamics and tissue architecture (agius2019selectiveproteolysisto pages 7-8, gormal2024locationlocationlocation pages 18-19).\n\n• **Regulation of Transcription and Pre-mRNA Processing:**  \nBeyond its cytoplasmic roles, Src has significant nuclear functions. Through PDGF-mediated pathways, Src phosphorylates transcription factors such as STAT1 and STAT3, thereby promoting their DNA-binding activity and altering gene transcription profiles essential for proliferation and differentiation. Moreover, Src’s phosphorylation of RNA-binding proteins (e.g., KHDRBS1) links it to the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing and processing, suggesting a role in post-transcriptional gene expression regulation that can have broad implications for cell function (agius2019selectiveproteolysisto pages 7-8, negi2021recentadvancesin pages 1-2).\n\n• **Cell Cycle Control and Apoptosis:**  \nSrc plays an influential role in cell cycle regulation by engaging mitogenic signaling pathways such as the CDK20/MAPK3 cascade, which facilitates progression through different phases of the cell cycle. Additionally, Src modulates apoptotic pathways by phosphorylating key regulators such as caspase-8 at Tyr-380, an event that down-regulates the caspase’s pro-apoptotic function. Through these mechanisms, Src helps coordinate the balance between cell proliferation and programmed cell death, a balance that is often disrupted during oncogenic transformation (joshi2020substratebindingto pages 15-17, kumar2015pharmacologyofsrc pages 7-10).\n\n• **Bone Resorption:**  \nIn osteoclasts, Src is indispensable for bone resorption. Src forms complexes with kinases such as PTK2B/PYK2 and phosphorylates substrates like CBL to recruit phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). This signaling cascade not only triggers the resorptive activity of osteoclasts but also stimulates mitochondrial energy production via cytochrome C oxidase activation, thereby fulfilling the considerable energetic demands required for bone remodeling (ma2019characterizationofthe pages 1-2, martellucci2020srcfamilykinases pages 18-20).\n\n• **Regulation of Receptor Internalization and Desensitization:**  \nSrc contributes to the internalization of receptors through phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms. For example, phosphorylation of clathrin heavy chain (CLTC) at Tyr-1477 by Src is essential for EGFR internalization, a process that facilitates receptor recycling or degradation following ligand binding. Concurrently, Src regulates β-arrestin desensitization through the activation of GRK2, ensuring that receptor signaling is appropriately tempered after activation (johnson2023anatlasof pages 1-2, amatya2019dynamicregulatoryfeatures pages 7-9).\n\n• **Immune and Antiviral Signaling:**  \nSrc has been implicated in various aspects of immune signaling. By enhancing RIG-I-mediated antiviral responses, Src participates in the cellular innate immune defense against viral infection. Additionally, Src is known to influence inflammatory signaling pathways—such as the IL6–YAP1–NOTCH cascade—which promote epithelial regeneration in response to tissue injury. These roles position Src as a key intermediary not only in normal immune responses but also in pathological states such as chronic inflammation (agius2019selectiveproteolysisto pages 7-8, gormal2024locationlocationlocation pages 18-19).\n\nCollectively, the wide range of Src functions underscores its importance as an integrator of extracellular signals, translating them into diverse cellular outcomes that include changes in gene expression, morphology, adhesion, and survival. Its ability to cross-communicate between cytoplasmic and nuclear events further exemplifies the versatility and centrality of Src in cellular physiology (amatya2019dynamicregulatoryfeatures pages 7-9, joshi2020substratebindingto pages 1-4, fischer2017approvedandexperimental pages 24-27).\n\n## 8. Other Comments  \nIn addition to its well-established catalytic and regulatory roles, Src is also notable for several extra-catalytic functions and associations that have broad implications in both basic research and clinical applications:\n\n• **Inhibitors and Therapeutic Targeting:**  \nSrc’s involvement in multiple signaling pathways and its hyperactivation in various cancers make it a prime target for therapeutic intervention. A significant number of small-molecule inhibitors, primarily targeting the ATP-binding pocket of the kinase domain, have been developed. However, achieving selectivity for Src over other SFKs is challenging due to high structural homology. Emerging approaches include allosteric inhibitors and substrate-based inhibitors, which aim to exploit unique conformational or docking interfaces to enhance selectivity and reduce off-target effects (biswas2024theprospectof pages 1-2, chakraborty2019targetingdynamicatpbinding pages 9-10).\n\n• **Functional Redundancy and Compensatory Mechanisms:**  \nWhile Src is often the principal kinase activated downstream of receptor engagement, it exists within a family of closely related kinases that can compensate for one another’s loss or inhibition. This functional redundancy presents both a challenge and an opportunity; understanding the unique versus overlapping roles of SFKs is critical for designing effective therapies. Advanced phosphoproteomic studies and genetic models are currently being utilized to delineate Src-specific functions from those shared by other SFK members (agius2019selectiveproteolysisto pages 7-8, amatya2019dynamicregulatoryfeatures pages 7-9).\n\n• **Disease Associations:**  \nAberrant Src signaling has been implicated in a variety of disease states. In oncology, elevated Src activity correlates with tumor progression, metastasis, and therapy resistance in cancers such as breast, colon, lung, and pancreatic carcinoma. In the skeletal system, mutations or dysregulation of Src are associated with osteoclast dysfunction, contributing to bone disorders like osteopetrosis. There is also growing evidence linking Src dysregulation to inflammation and immune deficiencies, as well as emerging associations with neurodegenerative conditions where disturbances in cellular adhesion and signaling are present (goel2023seekingabetter pages 1-2, kumar2015pharmacologyofsrc pages 7-10).\n\n• **Drug Resistance and Combination Therapies:**  \nClinical investigations of Src inhibitors have uncovered challenges related to drug resistance. Often, the inhibition of Src alone is insufficient to produce durable responses in cancer, as compensatory activation of alternative pathways can circumvent the block. As a result, combination therapies that target Src in conjunction with other signaling nodes (such as PI3K-Akt or MAPK pathways) are being explored. These combination strategies aim to reduce the likelihood of resistance and to produce synergistic antitumor effects (biswas2024theprospectof pages 1-2, chakraborty2019targetingdynamicatpbinding pages 9-10).\n\n• **Scaffolding and Non-Catalytic Roles:**  \nIn addition to its enzymatic activity, Src functions as an adaptor or scaffolding protein via its SH2 and SH3 domains. These domains mediate the assembly of large multiprotein complexes, thereby extending Src’s influence beyond direct phosphorylation events. The ability to function in a scaffolding capacity is critical for the fine-tuning of signal transduction networks, as it helps organize signaling complexes at discrete cellular locations (joshi2020substratebindingto pages 1-4, ortiz2021srcfamilykinases pages 2-5).\n\n• **Current Research Trends:**  \nThe current research landscape on Src focuses on obtaining high-resolution structural insights and dynamic models that explain how Src transitions between different conformational states. Computational modeling and molecular dynamics simulations are increasingly used to predict allosteric changes and to aid in the design of next-generation inhibitors. Such studies are vital for developing agents with greater specificity and improved clinical profiles. Additionally, the role of Src in regulating not only cytoplasmic but also nuclear events is receiving renewed attention, with implications for how aberrant Src activation contributes to transcriptional dysregulation in disease (passannanti2021applicationofcomputational pages 111-114, negi2021recentadvancesin pages 1-2).\n\nThese additional features highlight that Src is not simply a conventional enzyme but a multifunctional signaling hub whose disruption can lead to significant pathological consequences. Its central position within the cellular signaling network and its involvement in multiple disease processes underscore the importance of continued research into the development of targeted, selective inhibitors.\n\n## 9.

    "professor": "amy",
    "answer": "1. Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase Yes (YES1) belongs to the Src family kinases (SFKs), a well‐conserved paralog group of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases that emerged early in metazoan evolution. YES1 is evolutionarily related to classical SFK members such as Src, Fyn, and Lyn, sharing a highly conserved modular architecture that includes regulatory and catalytic domains. It is present in a wide variety of metazoan species with orthologs detected from invertebrates to mammals, underscoring its essential role in eukaryotic cell signaling. The kinase belongs to the cytoplasmic group of protein tyrosine kinases and is phylogenetically distinct from receptor tyrosine kinases, which have evolved additional extracellular ligand‐binding domains. Comparative phylogenetic analyses indicate that YES1 and its close relatives have maintained a high degree of sequence conservation across vertebrates, suggesting that the regulatory mechanisms and substrate specificities typical of SFKs were established in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or shortly thereafter (berndt2021newstructuralperspectives pages 1-2, gocek2014nonreceptorproteintyrosine pages 1-2, santos2016paralogspecificpatternsof pages 19-20).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nYES1 catalyzes the transfer of the γ‐phosphate from ATP to the hydroxyl group of tyrosine residues on protein substrates. The reaction mechanism follows the classic bi–bi kinetic model observed in protein kinases where ATP binds to the kinase active site in the presence of a divalent metal ion, and the phosphoryl group is transferred to the phenolic hydroxyl of a tyrosine residue, yielding ADP and a phosphotyrosine-modified substrate. This phosphorylation event plays a critical role in modulating substrate protein activity, stability, and interaction with downstream signaling molecules. YES1 thus serves as a molecular switch by converting external receptor stimulation (via receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGFR, PDGFR, CSF1R, and FGFR) into a phosphorylation cascade that influences various cellular processes (berndt2021newstructuralperspectives pages 1-2, bhullar2018kinasetargetedcancertherapies pages 13-13).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nAs with most protein kinases, YES1 requires divalent metal ions, particularly Mg²⁺, which coordinate with ATP to facilitate efficient phosphoryl transfer. The presence of Mg²⁺ helps to stabilize the negative charges on the phosphate groups of ATP, positioning it correctly within the catalytic pocket of the kinase to allow the transfer of the phosphate group onto the substrate's tyrosine residue. Although there is no specific evidence in the provided reports that YES1 requires additional unique cofactors, the conserved catalytic mechanism across the Src family suggests that Mg²⁺ serves as an essential cofactor for YES1 activity (berndt2021newstructuralperspectives pages 1-2, santos2016paralogspecificpatternsof pages 19-20).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nYES1 exhibits substrate specificity characteristic of Src family kinases. It phosphorylates a variety of physiological substrates that are critical for cellular processes such as junction assembly, cell migration, and cell cycle regulation. Physiologically, YES1 is known to phosphorylate:  \n• PARD3 – upon activation of EGFR, YES1 phosphorylates this polarity-related protein to promote the assembly of epithelial tight junctions.  \n• CTNND1 – through stimulation of related kinases such as Fyn and FER, YES1 indirectly modulates the phosphorylation state of junctional components to influence cell–cell adhesion.  \n• DPYSL2 (also known as CRMP2) – in T-cells, CXCL12 stimulation results in the phosphorylation of this substrate, thereby promoting cell migration.  \n• CDK4 – YES1 phosphorylates cyclin-dependent kinase 4, thus regulating the progression of the G₁ phase of the cell cycle, and it is also implicated in G₂/M progression and cytokinesis.  \n• OCT2 – by phosphorylating the organic cation transporter OCT2, YES1 can enhance its transport function.  \n\nMoreover, motif analyses derived from yeast-based phosphorylation assays indicate that YES1, similar to other SFKs, exhibits enrichment for specific amino acid residues flanking the phosphotyrosine site. For instance, the presence of negatively charged residues at specific positions relative to the tyrosine appears to be a determinant for recognition by YES1, although a fully defined consensus sequence for YES1 remains less clearly delineated compared with some other kinases (bhullar2018kinasetargetedcancertherapies pages 13-13, corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 126-130, santos2016paralogspecificpatternsof pages 19-20).\n\n5. Structure  \nYES1 is characterized by a modular organization typical of Src family kinases. Its structure can be divided into several domains with distinct functions:  \n• An N-terminal SH4 domain – contains sites for myristoylation (and in some cases palmitoylation) that mediate membrane anchoring, ensuring correct subcellular localization upon activation.  \n• A unique region – this segment provides an additional layer of regulatory control, which may contribute to isoform-specific functional differences.  \n• SH3 domain – facilitates protein–protein interactions by binding proline-rich motifs in partner proteins, an interaction that is important for both substrate recognition and intramolecular regulation.  \n• SH2 domain – recognizes and binds to phosphotyrosine-containing sequences on activated receptors and other signaling proteins, thus playing a central role in propagating downstream signaling events.  \n• Catalytic kinase domain (SH1) – contains the active site responsible for ATP binding and phosphoryl transfer, exhibiting the conserved kinase fold and key catalytic residues analogous to those in other SFKs.  \n\nCrystal structures of related Src kinases reveal that the active site of YES1 is highly conserved and contains regulatory phosphorylation sites, such as an activation loop whose phosphorylation correlates with increased catalytic activity, and an inhibitory C-terminal region that, when phosphorylated, binds intramolecularly to the SH2 domain to maintain an inactive conformation. Unique features of YES1 might include variations in the unique region that differentiate its substrate binding or regulatory interactions from other SFKs (berndt2021newstructuralperspectives pages 1-2, garmendia2022yes1anovel pages 1-2, gocek2014nonreceptorproteintyrosine pages 1-2).\n\n6. Regulation  \nYES1 regulation is multifaceted and involves several post-translational modifications and protein-protein interactions. Key regulatory mechanisms include:  \n• Autophosphorylation – YES1 undergoes autophosphorylation on its activation loop, which promotes a conformational change to an active state. In contrast, phosphorylation at the C-terminal region by regulatory kinases (e.g., C-terminal Src kinase, CSK, in related systems) helps maintain an inactive conformation in other SFKs; while specific CSK interactions with YES1 have not been as extensively described, regulatory parallels in the Src family suggest similar mechanisms (berndt2021newstructuralperspectives pages 1-2, gocek2014nonreceptorproteintyrosine pages 2-3).  \n• Recruitment by RTKs – Upon stimulation of receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGFR, PDGFR, CSF1R, and FGFR, YES1 is recruited to phosphorylated receptors. This recruitment, mediated largely by the SH2 domain binding to phosphotyrosine motifs on activated receptors, facilitates its activation and targeting to specific substrates in the plasma membrane microdomains (berndt2021newstructuralperspectives pages 1-2, kook2024emergingrolesof pages 1-2).  \n• Interactions with adaptor proteins – The SH3 and SH2 domains mediate interactions with regulatory and adaptor proteins, enhancing the selectivity and spatial coordination of substrate phosphorylation. For example, YES1 phosphorylates components such as PARD3 and supports the activation of other kinases like Fyn and FER through such interactions, which further amplifies downstream signaling (garmendia2022yes1anovel pages 1-2, corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 146-149).  \n\nThese regulatory modifications allow YES1 to function as a finely tuned signaling node. The dynamic interplay between activating autophosphorylation, receptor-mediated recruitment, and inhibitory intramolecular bonds ensures that YES1 activity is appropriately modulated in response to various extracellular stimuli (corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 152-155, kook2024emergingrolesof pages 13-14).\n\n7. Function  \nYES1 plays a central role in integrating extracellular signals into cellular responses that regulate a broad range of biological processes. Its well-documented functions include:  \n• Regulation of cell growth and survival – YES1 phosphorylates key substrates involved in cell cycle progression, such as cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), thereby regulating the G₁ phase and influencing subsequent stages of cell division, including roles in G₂/M progression and cytokinesis.  \n• Modulation of cell-cell adhesion and cytoskeleton remodeling – By phosphorylating junctional proteins such as PARD3 and indirectly modifying CTNND1 at cell-cell contacts via the activation of related kinases (Fyn and FER), YES1 contributes to the maintenance and dynamic remodeling of epithelial and other cell junctions.  \n• Facilitation of cell migration – YES1 phosphorylates the collapsin response mediator protein 2 (DPYSL2/CRMP2) in T-cells following CXCL12 stimulation, a modification that enhances cell motility. Additionally, YES1 participates in CD95L/FASLG signaling pathways that mediate AKT-dependent migration, linking its activity to immune cell trafficking as well as cancer cell invasiveness.  \n• Regulation of transporter activity – Through phosphorylation of the organic cation transporter OCT2, YES1 enhances transporter function, illustrating its role in modulating cellular uptake and metabolic processes.  \n\nThese functions position YES1 as a critical regulator in oncogenic signaling networks. Its overexpression and amplification have been linked to various cancers, where aberrant YES1 activity contributes to uncontrolled proliferation, survival, and resistance to targeted therapies. Thus, YES1 is not only a central component of normal cellular signaling but also a potential therapeutic target in oncology (bhullar2018kinasetargetedcancertherapies pages 13-13, garmendia2022yes1anovel pages 1-1, kook2024emergingrolesof pages 1-2).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nIn addition to its core functions, YES1 has garnered significant attention in the context of cancer biology due to its amplification and overexpression in a variety of solid tumors. Notably, YES1 gene amplifications are correlated with poor prognosis and have been implicated in resistance to targeted therapy regimens involving EGFR and other receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. For example, overexpression of YES1 has been associated with resistance to EGFR-targeted drugs, and treatment with broad-spectrum SFK inhibitors such as dasatinib has shown some efficacy in overcoming this resistance. Recent studies also suggest that YES1 expression may serve as a predictive biomarker for response to such treatments, thereby identifying patients who might benefit from YES1-targeted strategies (garmendia2022yes1anovel pages 1-2, kook2024emergingrolesof pages 1-2, kook2024emergingrolesof pages 13-14).  \n\nEmerging proteomic studies have further indicated that YES1 exists in distinct proteoforms that may differentially respond to pharmacological interventions, adding another layer of complexity to its regulation and functional output (leo2023proteoformleveldeconvolutionreveals pages 6-8). Moreover, the potential for targeting unique regulatory elements within the YES1 structure – such as its intrinsically disordered N-terminal regulatory region – is an area of active research, with the promise of developing selective inhibitors that minimize off-target toxicity often observed with broader SFK inhibitors (chakraborty2019targetingdynamicatpbinding pages 9-10).  \n\nDisease associations extend beyond oncogenesis, as YES1 is involved in fundamental cellular processes such as T-cell migration and epithelial barrier formation, thereby implicating it in immune modulation and tissue integrity. Ongoing research aims to elucidate the full spectrum of YES1 substrates and signaling networks, which may lead to refined therapeutic approaches that target specific aspects of YES1-mediated signaling pathways (corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 146-149, kook2024emergingrolesof pages 13-14).\n\n9.

    "answer": "## 1. Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase BLK (gene: BLK, UniProt: P51451), also known as B lymphocyte kinase or p55‑Blk, belongs to the Src family of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases. BLK is phylogenetically grouped alongside other Src family members such as LYN, FYN, and LCK. Its evolutionary roots can be traced back to early metazoans, where the Src module (comprising SH3, SH2, and a catalytic kinase domain) first emerged and diversified into several lineage‐specific branches. BLK, in particular, exhibits high expression in B-lineage cells, reflecting its specialized role in B cell development and receptor signaling pathways. Orthologs of BLK have been identified in several mammalian species, indicating that its function in regulating B cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling is evolutionarily conserved; in this respect, BLK is part of an evolutionary core of Src family kinases that have maintained similar domain organization and regulatory features throughout vertebrate evolution (zhang2021srcfamilyprotein pages 1-2, kwon2019tracingtheevolution pages 41-45). Furthermore, as with other Src family kinases, the BLK gene is thought to have undergone gene duplication events during early vertebrate evolution, resulting in structurally and functionally related kinases that now orchestrate complementary signaling cascades in lymphoid as well as, in some cases, non‑lymphoid cells (bhanumathy2021proteintyrosinekinases pages 7-9).\n\n## 2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nBLK catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to tyrosine residues on protein substrates, thereby converting ATP to ADP and yielding a phosphorylated protein substrate plus a proton. In a typical reaction, BLK uses its kinase activity to phosphorylate specific tyrosine sites on integral components of the B cell receptor complex – for example, CD79A and CD79B – as well as other regulatory proteins such as immunoglobulin receptors (FCGR2A, FCGR2B, FCGR2C) and cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (CGAS). This modification plays an essential role in initiating and propagating intracellular signaling cascades that regulate cell activation, differentiation, and apoptosis (gallegos2016theoreticalstudyon pages 12-15, reys2022insilicoprofiling pages 29-32). The catalytic mechanism involves binding of ATP in the cleft formed between the N-terminal and C-terminal lobes of the kinase domain, the positioning of the substrate polypeptide in close proximity to key catalytic residues, and the subsequent transfer of the γ-phosphate to the hydroxyl group of a tyrosine residue on the substrate, a process coupled with conformational changes that facilitate the reaction (kwon2019tracingtheevolution pages 60-65).\n\n## 3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe phosphoryl transfer reaction carried out by BLK requires the presence of divalent metal ions. Magnesium (Mg²⁺) is the principal metal ion cofactor that binds to ATP, stabilizing its phosphate groups and facilitating correct positioning for the phosphoryl transfer reaction. In some cases, other divalent cations such as Mn²⁺ may substitute for Mg²⁺ under certain experimental conditions, but Mg²⁺ remains the primary cofactor in vivo (reys2022insilicoprofiling pages 29-32, reys2022insilicoprofiling pages 32-35). This requirement is common among protein kinases and is critical to both binding ATP in the active site and stabilizing the transition state during the catalysis. No additional cofactors have been described as essential for BLK activity beyond the anticipated requirement for ATP and Mg²⁺.\n\n## 4. Substrate Specificity  \nBLK displays substrate specificity characteristic of Src family tyrosine kinases. Physiologically, BLK phosphorylates key components of the B cell receptor (BCR) signaling cascade. Notably, it phosphorylates CD79A on tyrosine residues Tyr-188 and Tyr-199, and CD79B on Tyr-196 and Tyr-207, which are critical for signal transduction upon antigen binding (OpenTargets Search: -BLK). In addition, BLK phosphorylates immunoglobulin G receptors – FCGR2A, FCGR2B, and FCGR2C – modulating downstream immune responsiveness (zhang2021srcfamilyprotein pages 1-2). BLK’s specificity is determined by the combination of its catalytic domain's predisposition for tyrosine residues and the contribution of adjacent SH2 and SH3 domains that facilitate substrate docking, often via recognition of phosphotyrosine motifs in target proteins. Functionally, BLK helps set the threshold for B cell receptor signaling by engaging with immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) within its substrates, which is critical for processes such as the pre-B to pro-B cell transition and the subsequent activation of NF-κB signaling pathways (zhang2021srcfamilyprotein pages 6-7). While a defined consensus substrate motif for BLK is not as extensively characterized as in some other kinases, its activity mirrors that of related Src family kinases, whereby acidic amino acids near the target tyrosine may enhance binding affinity and phosphorylation efficiency (kwon2019tracingtheevolution pages 60-65).\n\n## 5. Structure  \nThe structure of BLK reflects its membership in the Src family kinases and comprises several conserved domains that coordinate its regulatory and catalytic functions. At the N-terminus, BLK possesses a myristoylation sequence that facilitates its association with cell membranes, thereby positioning the kinase in proximity to its substrates. Following the N-terminal region is a unique domain that contributes to its cell-specific interactions, followed by highly conserved Src homology domains – SH3 and SH2 – which mediate protein-protein interactions and contribute to the autoinhibition of the kinase through intramolecular contacts (zhang2021srcfamilyprotein pages 1-2, kwon2019tracingtheevolution pages 37-41). The central catalytic domain, characteristic of protein kinases, contains the conserved motifs essential for catalysis including the glycine-rich loop, the catalytic loop with the HRD motif, and the DFG motif at the start of the activation loop. These conserved features ensure proper ATP binding and align the substrate for efficient phosphoryl transfer (reys2022insilicoprofiling pages 29-32, kwon2019tracingtheevolution pages 37-41). In addition, the regulatory C-terminal portion of BLK often contains sequences that modulate its activity either through further post-translational modifications or through additional protein interactions that can lock the kinase in either an active or inactive conformation (zhang2021srcfamilyprotein pages 4-6). Unique structural adaptations in BLK, as in other Src family members, include residues that stabilize an autoinhibited conformation by positioning the SH2 or SH3 domains against the kinase domain, thereby preventing substrate access until proper activation cues (kwon2019tracingtheevolution pages 37-41).\n\n## 6. Regulation  \nBLK is subject to multiple layers of regulation that control its catalytic activity and ensure proper temporal and spatial signaling in B cells. A major regulatory mechanism is mediated by phosphorylation. BLK activity is modulated by the phosphorylation state of key tyrosine residues both within the activation loop of the kinase domain and in its C-terminal regulatory region. Dephosphorylation of an inhibitory tyrosine—analogous to the regulatory mechanisms seen in other Src family kinases—activates BLK, while phosphorylation of the activation loop promotes full catalytic activity (zhang2021srcfamilyprotein pages 4-6, kwon2019tracingtheevolution pages 37-41). Additionally, the autoinhibitory conformation maintained through intramolecular interactions of the SH2 and SH3 domains with the kinase domain plays a critical role in preventing aberrant kinase activity. Such regulation ensures that BLK remains inactive in the absence of appropriate receptor-mediated signals. Upon engagement of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) by antigen, conformational changes are induced that relieve autoinhibition, allowing BLK to phosphorylate its substrates and propagate the B cell activation signal (zhang2021srcfamilyprotein pages 7-8). Outside the lymphoid context, regulatory mechanisms may also involve interactions with other signaling proteins or feedback loops that adjust BLK activity. For instance, BLK indirectly contributes to the activation of BTK by promoting its autophosphorylation, which in turn is essential for sustaining downstream signaling cascades in B cell differentiation and apoptosis (OpenTargets Search: -BLK). These phosphorylation events, combined with dynamic protein–protein interactions mediated by its SH2 and SH3 domains, exemplify the fine-tuned regulatory control that ensures BLK is activated only in response to precise cellular cues (kwon2019tracingtheevolution pages 37-41, zhang2021srcfamilyprotein pages 6-7).\n\n## 7. Function  \nBLK functions predominantly as a signal transducer in B cells, where it plays an essential role in development, differentiation, and activation. By phosphorylating key substrates of the B cell receptor (BCR) complex, BLK initiates and amplifies intracellular signals in response to antigen engagement. Its well‐characterized substrates include CD79A and CD79B, which upon phosphorylation create binding sites for additional signaling molecules such as Syk, ultimately leading to the activation of downstream cascades like NF‑κB, MAPK, and PI3K pathways that regulate B cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation (zhang2021srcfamilyprotein pages 1-2, zhang2021srcfamilyprotein pages 9-10). BLK is also known to function in the pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) signaling necessary for the pro‑B to pre‑B transition, thereby influencing early B cell development and ensuring proper antibody repertoire formation (zhang2021srcfamilyprotein pages 7-8). Moreover, in pancreatic islets, BLK has been implicated in modulating beta‑cell function by up‑regulating key transcription factors such as PDX1 and NKX6‑1, which in turn stimulate insulin secretion in response to glucose, suggesting a broader role in metabolic regulation outside the immune system (OpenTargets Search: -BLK). Additionally, BLK has been shown to phosphorylate CGAS, thereby promoting its retention in the cytosol and influencing innate immune responses (OpenTargets Search: -BLK). Collectively, these functions underscore BLK’s critical participation in both adaptive and innate immune responses as well as in metabolic regulation, linking its activity to processes such as immune tolerance, apoptosis, and cellular differentiation (zhang2021srcfamilyprotein pages 6-7, kwon2019tracingtheevolution pages 60-65).\n\n## 8. Other Comments  \nBLK has attracted considerable research interest not only because of its central role in B cell receptor signaling but also due to its emerging associations with several autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. Genetic studies have linked polymorphisms in the BLK promoter and intronic regions with altered expression and susceptibility to autoimmunity, implicating dysregulated BLK signaling in the pathogenesis of these disorders (zhang2021srcfamilyprotein pages 6-7). In addition to its immunological roles, BLK’s function in pancreatic beta cells suggests that it might represent a point of convergence between immune signaling and metabolic regulation, further broadening its potential as a therapeutic target. Although direct BLK-specific inhibitors are not as well characterized as some of its Src family counterparts, small molecule inhibitors that target the ATP-binding pocket or allosterically modulate Src family kinase activity—such as dasatinib—are known to affect BLK activity (bhanumathy2021proteintyrosinekinases pages 7-9, potter2023globalmethodsfor pages 75-78). Current research is exploring not only the identification of selective inhibitors for BLK but also the detailed mapping of its phosphorylation sites and downstream signaling partners, which could yield insights into its precise regulatory mechanisms and the development of targeted therapies for autoimmune diseases and other conditions linked to B cell dysregulation (kwon2019tracingtheevolution pages 60-65, zhang2021srcfamilyprotein pages 9-10). Another area of active interest is the investigation of BLK mutations and their potential impact on kinase function, substrate specificity, and regulation, with implications for novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Researchers continue to refine the use of mass spectrometry, peptide microarray analyses, and structural studies to delineate the comprehensive functional profile of BLK (lai2015investigationsofthe pages 23-28, reys2022insilicoprofiling pages 29-32).\n\n## 9.

    "answer": "1. Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase HCK is a member of the Src family kinases (SFKs), a sub‐group of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases characterized by a conserved modular architecture that includes sequential SH3, SH2, and kinase domains. Phylogenetically, HCK traces back to early metazoan evolution, where the Src module was already present in the common ancestor of animals, and its core design (including the regulatory SH3/SH2 domains and the catalytic kinase domain) is conserved among vertebrates. Orthologs of HCK are found throughout mammalian species and in other vertebrate taxa, underscoring its evolutionarily conserved role in hematopoietic cell signaling. The evolutionary relationships of HCK to other SFKs (such as SRC, LYN, YES, and FGR) have been well established via structural and sequence comparisons, and it is considered part of the regulatory network that evolved from an ancient kinase scaffold present in early eukaryotes (shah2018thesrcmodule pages 29-30, selzer2024cocrystallizationofthe pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nHCK catalyzes the transfer of the γ-phosphate from ATP to tyrosine residues within target proteins. In its canonical reaction, the enzyme binds ATP and a protein substrate, and facilitates nucleophilic attack by the hydroxyl group of a tyrosine residue, leading to the production of ADP, a phosphorylated tyrosine on the substrate, and the release of a proton. This phosphotransfer reaction is typical of protein tyrosine kinases and is the major means by which HCK propagates intracellular signaling via phosphorylation-dependent conformational changes and downstream docking events (selzer2024cocrystallizationofthe pages 1-2, shah2018thesrcmodule pages 1-3).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nAs with other members of the Src family, the catalytic activity of HCK is dependent on ATP and the presence of divalent metal ions. In particular, Mg²⁺ is required to coordinate ATP binding and stabilize the transition state during phosphoryl transfer. In several structural and biochemical studies of Src-family kinases, including those investigating HCK’s conformation through crystallography and AlphaFold predictions, the necessity of Mg²⁺ has been emphasized as a critical cofactor (selzer2024cocrystallizationofthe pages 4-5, xu2015identifyingthreedimensionalstructures pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nHCK exhibits a substrate specificity profile that follows the general recognition motifs characteristic of Src family kinases. Physiologically, HCK phosphorylates tyrosine residues within substrate proteins that regulate immune receptor signaling, cytoskeletal rearrangements, and cell adhesion. Known substrates include proteins involved in phagocytosis and cell survival, such as CBL, ADAM15, BCR, STAT5B, and TP73. The substrate selection is mediated in part by recognition via the kinase domain itself as well as docking interactions provided by its SH2 and SH3 domains, which can bind phosphotyrosine- or proline-rich sequences respectively. Recent high-impact studies (as referred in Nature 2023 and Nature 2024 literature) have refined the substrate sequence preferences for SFKs, establishing that HCK preferentially targets peptides with surrounding residues that conform to conserved motifs; however, the exact consensus sequence for HCK, while similar to those of its family members, may exhibit subtle divergences that fine-tune its signaling specificity in hematopoietic cells (selzer2024cocrystallizationofthe pages 5-6, shah2018thesrcmodule pages 25-27).\n\n5. Structure  \nThe structure of HCK is organized into a multidomain architecture emblematic of the Src family. Its N-terminal region comprises a myristoylation signal that facilitates membrane association, followed by a unique domain that may confer isoform-specific interactions. The core of HCK is the Src module, which includes an SH3 domain that interacts with proline-rich ligands, an SH2 domain that binds phosphotyrosine-containing peptides, and a catalytic kinase domain divided into an N-terminal lobe (characterized by a β-sheet and an αC-helix) and a larger C-terminal lobe rich in α-helices. High-resolution crystallographic studies and AlphaFold computational models have elucidated fine details of these domains. In particular, inhibitor-bound crystal structures of HCK have revealed that upon binding ATP-site inhibitors such as A-419259, HCK stabilizes an extended activation loop conformation with the key autophosphorylation site Tyr416 oriented toward the solvent, while the regulatory SH3 and SH2 domains impose an autoinhibited conformation through intramolecular interactions with the linker and C-terminal tail (selzer2024cocrystallizationofthe pages 1-2, selzer2024cocrystallizationofthe pages 7-8). Critical catalytic residues include a conserved lysine in the β3 strand (essential for ATP binding), the DFG motif in the activation loop required for coordinating Mg²⁺, and the activation loop tyrosine (Tyr416) whose autophosphorylation is pivotal for full activation. The interplay between the “DFG-in” configuration and the αC-helix position is a recurring structural theme that distinguishes active from inactive kinase conformations (kornev2015dynamicsdrivenallosteryin pages 1-2, selzer2024cocrystallizationofthe pages 4-5).\n\n6. Regulation  \nHCK is regulated by a complex interplay of autophosphorylation, conformational changes, and intramolecular domain interactions. In its inactive state, the SH3 domain binds to a polyproline type II helix present in the SH2-kinase linker, while the SH2 domain interacts with a phosphorylated tyrosine in the C-terminal tail (analogous to Tyr527 in c-Src), thereby stabilizing a closed autoinhibited conformation. Activation is achieved by disruption of these intramolecular interactions, most commonly via dephosphorylation of the inhibitory tail or by competitive binding of SH2/SH3 ligands. Autophosphorylation of the activation loop residue Tyr416 induces a conformational shift that realigns the catalytic residues to achieve full enzymatic activity. Furthermore, binding of ATP-site inhibitors (e.g., A-419259) has been shown to select for distinct conformations of the activation loop, suggesting that HCK’s regulatory dynamics include multiple active and intermediate states. This dynamic regulation, underpinned by an allosteric network within the kinase domain, plays a central role in modulating HCK’s activity in response to extracellular stimuli from various receptors including Fc receptors, cytokine receptors, and integrins (selzer2024cocrystallizationofthe pages 2-3, selzer2024cocrystallizationofthe pages 5-6, shah2018thesrcmodule pages 27-28).\n\n7. Function  \nHCK is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells such as neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and mast cells, where it plays a critical role in innate immune responses. Through its kinase activity, HCK transmits signals from cell surface receptors including those for immunoglobulins (e.g., FCGR1A, FCGR2A), cytokines (e.g., receptors for IFNG, IL2, IL6, IL8), and growth factors (e.g., CSF3R), as well as from integrins (e.g., ITGB1, ITGB2). Functionally, HCK contributes to phagocytosis by mediating the mobilization of secretory lysosomes, degranulation, and the activation of NADPH oxidase that incites the respiratory burst. In addition, HCK phosphorylates a variety of substrates such as CBL, ADAM15, BCR, STAT5B, TP73, and WAS, thereby influencing processes ranging from cell adhesion and migration to cell survival and proliferation. Beyond its positive signaling roles, HCK also inhibits TP73-mediated transcription and apoptosis, suggesting a potential anti-apoptotic function in certain contexts. Given these roles, HCK is implicated in the regulation of inflammatory responses and has been extensively studied for its contributions to hematologic malignancies, including chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (OpenTargets Search: -HCK, selzer2024cocrystallizationofthe pages 2-3, shah2018thesrcmodule pages 25-27).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nHCK is a validated therapeutic target in oncology, particularly in hematologic cancers such as CML and AML. Potent ATP-competitive inhibitors, notably Dasatinib, have been shown to inhibit HCK and are currently in clinical trials or approved for use in specific contexts involving deregulated SFK activity. The differential sensitivity of HCK to inhibitors, which is partially due to distinct conformational states induced by autophosphorylation and inhibitor binding (for example, the extended activation loop conformation stabilized by A-419259), underscores the importance of understanding its dynamic regulatory mechanisms. Mutational analysis has demonstrated that alterations in the autoinhibitory interactions (for example, mutations disrupting SH3 or SH2 domain contacts) can lead to constitutive activation of HCK, thereby contributing to oncogenesis. Moreover, HCK’s interplay with other SFKs and its role in resistance mechanisms to therapies such as imatinib highlight ongoing research efforts aimed at clarifying its detailed signaling network and the development of more selective inhibitors. Advanced structural bioinformatics approaches, including crystallographic analyses and predictive models like those from AlphaFold, are instrumental in mapping its conformational landscape and guiding rational drug design (selzer2024cocrystallizationofthe pages 7-8, shah2018thesrcmodule pages 28-29, xu2015identifyingthreedimensionalstructures pages 22-23).\n\n9.

    "professor": "amy",
    "answer": "## 1. Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase Lyn is a member of the evolutionarily ancient Src family of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases (SFKs). This family is highly conserved across vertebrates and can be traced back to early metazoan ancestors, which indicates that their modular architecture and signaling functions were fundamental for the evolution of multicellularity (bhanumathy2021proteintyrosinekinases pages 1-2). Within the SFK group, Lyn is closely related to other paralogous kinases such as Src, Fyn, Lck, and Yes. Although these kinases share the hallmark SH4, SH3, SH2, and catalytic domains, Lyn has evolved unique regulatory characteristics that reflect its preferential expression in the hematopoietic and immune cell lineages. This specialization has permitted Lyn to perform dual roles—acting either as a positive or negative regulator—in immune receptor signaling cascades. Studies indicate that the catalytic kinase domain of Lyn is highly conserved among mammals, and orthologs of Lyn exist in all major vertebrate species, underlining its fundamental contribution to immune surveillance and cellular homeostasis (weerawarna2023lynkinasestructure pages 1-3, brodie2018lynlupusand pages 2-3). In addition, gene duplication events that expanded the Src family set have led to diversification in substrate recognition and regulation among the family members. The evolution of distinct regulatory phosphorylation sites and domain interfaces within Lyn underscores how subtle variations in sequence and structure have been selected to meet the specific demands of B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling and innate immune pathways (sakkiah2017overviewofthe pages 2-3, santos2016paralogspecificpatternsof pages 18-19). This evolutionary divergence is critical for enabling the fine-tuned balance between activation and inhibition required for precise immunological responses.\n\n## 2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nLyn catalyzes a classic phosphotransfer reaction characteristic of protein tyrosine kinases. In this reaction, Lyn facilitates the transfer of the γ-phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the hydroxyl group of a tyrosine residue on a substrate protein. The overall reaction can be formally written as:  \n ATP + protein–tyrosine → ADP + protein–phosphotyrosine + H⁺  \nThis reaction occurs within the well-defined catalytic cleft of Lyn’s kinase (SH1) domain. A conserved glycine-rich loop (often referred to as the P-loop) binds ATP and helps to position it such that the γ-phosphate is precisely oriented for nucleophilic attack by the tyrosine hydroxyl group on the substrate (bhanumathy2021proteintyrosinekinases pages 1-2). The phosphorylation event not only induces conformational changes in the modified substrate, thereby altering its enzymatic activity, localization, or protein–protein interactions, but also generates specific binding sites for downstream adapter proteins containing domains such as SH2 or phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains (corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 146-149). Thus, the kinase reaction carried out by Lyn is central to propagating intracellular signaling cascades in response to extracellular cues.\n\n## 3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe enzymatic activity of Lyn is heavily dependent on the availability of the divalent metal ion magnesium (Mg²⁺). Magnesium ions bind to ATP and facilitate the correct alignment of its phosphate groups within the active site of the kinase, thereby stabilizing the transition state during phosphotransfer (marholz2018insilicodesign pages 5-5). Although in vitro experiments occasionally use manganese (Mn²⁺) as an alternative cofactor, Mg²⁺ is the physiologically relevant cofactor required for efficient catalysis under cellular conditions. Beyond metal ion coordination, Lyn’s activity also critically depends on its membrane association. This is achieved by dual lipid modifications—myristoylation and palmitoylation—on its N-terminal SH4 domain. These post-translational modifications tether Lyn to the plasma membrane, concentrating it in lipid raft regions where immune receptors are localized and thereby enhancing the efficiency of substrate phosphorylation (weerawarna2023lynkinasestructure pages 3-4).\n\n## 4. Substrate Specificity  \nLyn exhibits broad substrate specificity, wherein it phosphorylates a diverse spectrum of proteins that are central to immune receptor signaling and hematopoietic regulation. Among its best-characterized substrates are components and associated molecules of the B-cell receptor (BCR) complex, including CD79A and CD79B; these proteins undergo phosphorylation upon antigen engagement, which is essential for the subsequent initiation of signaling cascades in B lymphocytes (corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 146-149, brodie2018lynlupusand pages 2-3). In addition to BCR components, Lyn phosphorylates co‐receptors such as CD5, CD19, and CD22, thereby fine-tuning both the activation and subsequent down-regulation phases of B cell responses.  \nLyn’s substrate repertoire also includes several signaling and adaptor molecules. For instance, it phosphorylates Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), and TEC kinase, wherein such modifications play pivotal roles in modulating cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation (jin2015proteintyrosinephosphorylation pages 124-129, deng2014globalanalysisof pages 10-13). A distinctive functional attribute of Lyn is its role in the negative regulation of immune signaling. This is achieved via the phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) on various receptor proteins. Upon phosphorylation, these ITIMs serve as docking sites for inhibitory phosphatases such as PTPN6 (SHP-1), PTPN11 (SHP-2), and INPP5D (SHIP-1), which in turn attenuate the signaling cascades to prevent hyperactivation of immune responses (arrington2019identificationofthe pages 12-12, gocek2014nonreceptorproteintyrosine pages 1-2).  \nAlthough Lyn does not adhere to a single strict consensus sequence for its substrates, its recognition largely depends on the combined selectivity of its kinase domain, along with targeting provided by its SH2 and SH3 domains. These domains help to guide Lyn to specific signaling complexes where substrates often present phosphorylation-prone motifs enriched for proline residues in adjacent regions or specific phosphotyrosine contexts (jin2015tyrosinephosphorylationof pages 22-25, santos2016paralogspecificpatternsof pages 18-19). Collectively, this broad and multifaceted substrate specificity enables Lyn to integrate signals from a variety of immune receptors and to contribute dynamically to both the propagation and attenuation of signal transduction.\n\n## 5. Structure  \nLyn kinase exhibits a modular structure that is a hallmark of the Src family kinases. Its primary structure can be divided into several distinct domains, each conferring specific functional properties.  \nAt the very N-terminus lies the SH4 domain, which is relatively short (approximately 16 residues) yet critically important for subcellular localization. This domain harbors sequences that direct dual lipid modifications—myristoylation typically on an N-terminal glycine and subsequent palmitoylation on neighboring cysteine residues. These modifications serve to anchor Lyn to the plasma membrane, particularly to the specialized microdomains known as lipid rafts, where many immune receptors and signaling complexes are found (weerawarna2023lynkinasestructure pages 3-4, marholz2018insilicodesign pages 5-5).  \nFollowing the SH4 domain is the unique domain. This region is characterized by a relatively low degree of sequence conservation among SFKs, which allows for paralog-specific functions and interactions. Variations in the length and sequence of the unique domain, as exemplified by the differences between LynA and LynB isoforms, are thought to contribute to diversified signaling roles, including influences on DNA replication and other nuclear functions in some contexts.  \nImmediately succeeding the unique domain is the SH3 domain. Typically comprising 60–70 amino acids, the SH3 domain is responsible for binding proline-rich motifs, usually adopting a polyproline type II helix structure when associated with its ligands. This domain is not only involved in mediating interactions with external substrates and adaptor proteins, but also contributes to autoinhibitory intramolecular interactions that maintain Lyn in a low-activity state under resting conditions (weerawarna2023lynkinasestructure pages 12-13, huang2016directedevolutionof pages 2-4).  \nAdjacent to the SH3 domain is the SH2 domain, which specifically recognizes phosphorylated tyrosine residues present in certain sequence contexts. The SH2 domain is essential for substrate recruitment; it binds to phosphotyrosine sites either on target proteins or even to phosphorylated residues on Lyn itself, thereby reinforcing conformational states that regulate kinase activity (gocek2014nonreceptorproteintyrosine pages 1-2, weerawarna2023lynkinasestructure pages 12-13).  \nCentral to Lyn’s function is the catalytic kinase or SH1 domain. This domain exhibits the classic bilobal architecture seen in many protein kinases: a smaller N-terminal lobe composed mainly of beta sheets (including the glycine-rich loop that facilitates ATP binding) and a larger C-terminal lobe that is predominately α-helical. Key structural motifs are present in this domain, such as the DFG (Asp-Phe-Gly) motif at the beginning of the activation loop and the HRD motif, both of which are essential for catalysis. The activation loop itself, upon autophosphorylation at a key tyrosine residue (often analogous to Tyr397 in Lyn), undergoes a conformational change that is necessary for full catalytic activity (corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 13-16, weerawarna2023lynkinasestructure pages 4-7).  \nIn addition to these domains, the C-terminal tail of Lyn contains regulatory elements, including a conserved tyrosine residue whose phosphorylation is responsible for mediating the autoinhibited conformation. When this tyrosine is phosphorylated, it binds intramolecularly to the SH2 domain, thereby stabilizing an inactive kinase conformation and preventing uncontrolled substrate phosphorylation. This multi-domain configuration, combined with specific post-translational modifications, allows Lyn to tightly regulate its activity in response to signaling events.\n\n## 6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of Lyn kinase is multifaceted, involving several layers of control that ensure its activity is precisely modulated according to cellular context. At the core of Lyn regulation are two key phosphorylation events that function in an antagonistic manner.  \nAutophosphorylation within the activation loop of the catalytic domain—for example, phosphorylation at a tyrosine residue analogous to Tyr397—induces a conformational shift that stabilizes the active form of Lyn, thereby enhancing its catalytic efficiency and substrate turnover (weerawarna2023lynkinasestructure pages 14-16). Conversely, a conserved tyrosine residue located in the C-terminal tail undergoes phosphorylation by dedicated kinases such as C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) or its homologs. Phosphorylation at this residue promotes an intramolecular interaction with Lyn’s own SH2 domain, resulting in a closed, autoinhibited conformation that significantly diminishes kinase activity (tsantikos2014roleofthe pages 14-15, corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 16-18).  \nBeyond these primary phosphorylation events, Lyn’s regulatory framework is further reinforced by the roles of its SH3 and SH2 domains. Under basal conditions, these domains engage in intramolecular interactions that help maintain Lyn in a repressed state by sequestering structural elements necessary for catalytic activity. For instance, phosphorylation within the SH2 domain itself (such as on Tyr194) can modulate its binding affinity for external phosphotyrosine-containing substrates and affect its participation in regulatory autoinhibitory complexes (jin2015proteintyrosinephosphorylation pages 152-154).  \nAnother critical aspect of Lyn regulation is its spatial localization. The dual acylation of the N-terminal SH4 domain anchors Lyn to the plasma membrane, particularly to lipid raft microdomains where immune receptors reside. This localization not only ensures the enzyme encounters its intended substrates promptly upon receptor stimulation but also restricts its activity to specific subcellular compartments, thereby minimizing aberrant phosphorylation events (taft2017ayeastbasedassay pages 26-30, tsantikos2014roleofthe pages 16-16).  \nCollectively, these regulatory mechanisms establish Lyn as a molecular switch that can rapidly toggle between active and inactive states. This dynamic regulation is essential in immune cells, where precise control over signaling thresholds is necessary to prevent inappropriate activation or suppression, both of which can lead to pathological conditions such as autoimmunity or uncontrolled cell growth.\n\n## 7. Function  \nLyn kinase serves as a central integrator in multiple signaling pathways predominantly within hematopoietic and immune cells. One of its key roles is in the regulation of B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling. Upon antigen engagement, Lyn phosphorylates critical components of the BCR complex—including CD79A and CD79B—and co-receptors such as CD5, CD19, and CD22. These phosphorylation events initiate a cascade that leads to B-cell activation, promoting processes such as differentiation, proliferation, and survival while later contributing to the down-regulation of these signals to maintain immune self-tolerance (arrington2019identificationofthe pages 12-12, brodie2018lynlupusand pages 2-3).  \nIn addition to its role in B cells, Lyn is crucial in modulating the signaling of Fc receptors. By phosphorylating receptors like FCER1, FCGR1A, and FCGR2, Lyn is able to directly affect mast cell degranulation, macrophage activation, and the inflammatory response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide. This regulation is pivotal during immune responses to pathogens, where a rapid yet controlled inflammatory response is necessary (bhanumathy2021proteintyrosinekinases pages 1-2, corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 26-29).  \nFurthermore, Lyn influences signaling pathways initiated by Toll-like receptors (TLR2 and TLR4) as well as a variety of cytokine and growth factor receptors, including EPOR, KIT, MPL, CXCR4, and receptors for IL3, IL5, and CSF2. In these settings, Lyn mediates phosphorylation events that trigger kinase cascades such as the PI3K/AKT, MAP kinase, and STAT5 pathways. These cascades are critical for processes such as cellular proliferation, survival, migration, adhesion, and even differentiation in both hematopoietic progenitors and mature immune cells (deng2014globalanalysisof pages 10-13).  \nA particularly noteworthy feature of Lyn’s function is its dual capacity to both activate and inhibit signaling pathways. In certain contexts, Lyn phosphorylates immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) on receptor proteins to recruit inhibitory phosphatases like SHP-1 (PTPN6), SHP-2 (PTPN11), and SHIP-1 (INPP5D). This negative feedback serves to attenuate signaling events once an immune response has been initiated, ensuring that responses do not become excessive and cause autoimmunity or chronic inflammation (jin2015proteintyrosinephosphorylation pages 124-129, arrington2019identificationofthe pages 12-12).  \nIn additional contexts, Lyn has been implicated in oncogenic processes; for example, its substrate repertoire includes the BCR-ABL fusion protein, whose phosphorylation by Lyn is associated with leukemogenesis. Overexpression or dysregulation of Lyn has also been observed in various solid tumors, including breast, prostate, and colorectal carcinomas, where it may drive aberrant proliferation and survival signals.  \nThus, Lyn is not only fundamental for the initiation and modulation of adaptive immune responses but also plays a regulatory role in innate immunity, cell adhesion, and even in the malignant transformation of cells. Its balanced activity, ensured by sophisticated regulatory mechanisms, is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis and normal cellular functions across diverse cell types.\n\n## 8. Other Comments  \nDue to its critical regulatory roles in both positive and negative signaling pathways, Lyn has emerged as an attractive therapeutic target in a variety of pathological conditions. Aberrant activation or overexpression of Lyn is implicated in hematological malignancies, autoimmune disorders, and inflammatory diseases. Recent efforts in drug discovery have focused on identifying small-molecule inhibitors that selectively modulate Lyn activity. DNA-encoded library screening approaches, for instance, have yielded novel compounds that target either the ATP-binding pocket or distinct allosteric sites on Lyn. Such inhibitors are in preclinical development, with some progressing to clinical evaluation in attempts to mitigate conditions associated with Lyn hyperactivity (sun2022targetingproteinproteininteractions pages 18-24, sun2022targetingproteinproteininteractions pages 52-56).  \nStructural studies of Lyn, although somewhat limited due to the preponderance of crystal structures capturing the kinase in its active conformation, continue to shed light on the dynamic nature of its regulatory domain interactions. Current research aims to solve additional structures—particularly of the inactive conformation—to facilitate structure-based drug design. The high degree of conservation within the ATP-binding site across Src family kinases, however, poses a significant challenge, necessitating strategies that exploit subtle differences in domain interfaces or allosteric regions unique to Lyn (taft2017ayeastbasedassay pages 26-30, tsantikos2014roleofthe pages 16-16).  \nMoreover, there is an ongoing interest in understanding the contributions of Lyn’s intrinsically disordered regions, such as the unique domain, which may undergo regulatory phosphorylation that influences functions beyond canonical membrane-associated signaling. In some isoforms, phosphorylation events within these regions have been linked to nuclear activities, including the regulation of DNA replication (weerawarna2023lynkinasestructure pages 3-4, huang2016directedevolutionof pages 2-4).  \nFrom a clinical perspective, mutations that either result in inadequate or excessive Lyn activity have been associated with immune dysregulation. For instance, gain-of-function variants may lead to aberrant activation and early-onset autoinflammatory syndromes, while loss-of-function mutations can result in compromised immune responses and increased susceptibility to infections or autoimmunity (tsantikos2014roleofthe pages 14-15, brodie2018lynlupusand pages 2-3). In addition, the participation of Lyn in the phosphorylation of oncogenic proteins—such as the BCR-ABL fusion protein—underscores its potential as a target in leukemia and other cancers.  \nFinally, combination therapy strategies that target Lyn in conjunction with other components of the immune signaling machinery are under investigation. Such approaches could enhance therapeutic efficacy while reducing the potential for drug resistance associated with monotherapy. In summary, Lyn kinase is a multifaceted enzyme whose regulation and function make it both a critical player in normal cellular physiology and a promising target for the development of novel therapeutic agents in immune-related and oncogenic diseases.\n\n## 9.

    "answer": "1. Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase CSK is an evolutionarily conserved non‐receptor tyrosine kinase that is not a member of the Src family per se but functions as the major endogenous negative regulator of Src family kinases (SFKs). CSK and its homolog CHK share a common ancestry that can be traced back to early holozoan organisms, and studies have demonstrated that the negative regulation of Src by phosphorylation emerged early in evolution – a conserved regulatory mechanism observed from choanoflagellates and filastereans to metazoans (advani2017cskhomologouskinase(chk) pages 1-2, taskinen2017earlyemergenceof pages 1-2). Classified within the tyrosine kinase group, CSK is grouped with families involved in intracellular signal transduction. Orthologs of CSK have been identified in a wide range of species, underscoring its fundamental role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper regulation of SFKs (taskinen2017earlyemergenceof pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCSK catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to a specific tyrosine residue located in the C-terminal tail of its substrate proteins, primarily the SFKs. This reaction involves the binding of ATP and the SFK substrate into the kinase active site, where the γ-phosphate of ATP is transferred to the hydroxyl group of the conserved tyrosine residue (commonly Tyr530 in human c-Src), leading to the formation of ADP and the phosphorylated (inhibited) form of the SFK (roskoski2015srcproteintyrosinekinase pages 1-2, sun2023dissectionofthe pages 2-3). This phosphorylation event induces intramolecular interactions within SFKs—specifically the binding of the newly created phosphotyrosine site to the kinase’s SH2 domain—that serve to lock the kinase in a closed, autoinhibited conformation.\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of CSK is dependent on the binding of ATP, which serves as the phosphate donor in its catalytic reaction. In addition to ATP, divalent metal cations are essential cofactors; CSK requires magnesium ions (Mg²⁺) for proper catalysis, as Mg²⁺ coordinates the phosphates of ATP and facilitates the phosphoryl transfer reaction (sun2023dissectionofthe pages 3-4, zhu2023regulationtargetsand pages 1-2). In some experimental contexts, substitution with manganese (Mn²⁺) may modulate the kinetics of substrate binding or turnover, though Mg²⁺ is most likely the physiological cofactor ensuring maximal catalytic efficiency (sun2023dissectionofthe pages 3-4).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCSK exhibits a remarkably high degree of substrate specificity that is centered predominantly on the Src family of tyrosine kinases. Its primary known physiological substrates include SFKs such as Src, Lck, Hck, Fyn, Lyn, and YES1, all of which harbor a conserved C-terminal tyrosine residue that, when phosphorylated by CSK, triggers an intramolecular interaction that leads to kinase inactivation (fortner2022apoptosisregulationby pages 2-4, roskoski2015srcproteintyrosinekinase pages 1-2). The substrate recognition by CSK is mediated not solely by the sequence around the target tyrosine but also by tertiary structural elements that facilitate precise docking; docking interactions between CSK’s active site and the substrate’s kinase domain ensure that the C-terminal tail is appropriately oriented for phosphorylation. Although a defined consensus motif has not been as explicitly characterized as for some serine/threonine kinases, the specificity is enhanced by the unique three-dimensional arrangement of binding surfaces in CSK that complement the structure of its substrates (advani2017cskhomologouskinase(chk) pages 1-2, fortner2022apoptosisregulationby pages 2-4).\n\n5. Structure  \nCSK is organized into three major domains: an N-terminal Src Homology 3 (SH3) domain, a central Src Homology 2 (SH2) domain, and a C-terminal kinase (SH1) domain. Unlike the SFKs, CSK lacks the N-terminal fatty acylation (myristoylation) sites and does not possess a C-terminal regulatory tyrosine within its own structure; instead, its role is dedicated to phosphorylating the regulatory tails of its substrate kinases (roskoski2015srcproteintyrosinekinase pages 4-5, barkho2014intramoleculardynamicsand pages 28-33). The SH3 and SH2 domains function as protein–protein interaction modules that enable CSK to be recruited to membranes and other signaling complexes by binding to adaptor proteins such as Csk-binding protein (CBP) or PAG1, which localize the kinase in proximity to its SFK substrates (fortner2022apoptosisregulationby pages 2-4, sun2023dissectionofthe pages 5-6). The kinase domain itself, although sharing a structural fold common among protein kinases, is intrinsically inactive and requires activation via conformational rearrangements induced by the regulatory domains; key residues in this domain are involved in coordinating ATP and stabilizing the transition state during phosphoryl transfer (roskoski2015srcproteintyrosinekinase pages 4-5, sun2023dissectionofthe pages 5-6). Structural studies, including X-ray crystallography and molecular dynamics simulations, have elucidated that interdomain communication—especially via the SH2-kinase linker—plays an essential role in modulating the catalytic activity of CSK (sun2023dissectionofthe pages 5-6, barkho2014intramoleculardynamicsand pages 134-137).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe activity and localization of CSK are tightly regulated by multiple mechanisms that ensure appropriate spatial and temporal control of SFK activity. A major regulatory mechanism involves the recruitment of CSK to the plasma membrane by adaptor proteins such as CBP/PAG, which contain phosphorylated tyrosine motifs that bind to the SH2 domain of CSK, thereby positioning the kinase in the vicinity of its substrates (fortner2022apoptosisregulationby pages 2-4, zhu2023regulationtargetsand pages 2-3). In addition, protein–protein interactions mediated by the SH3 domain facilitate the binding of CSK to proline-rich motifs present in other regulatory proteins, further enhancing its localization and activity. Post-translational modifications also play a pivotal role; for instance, phosphorylation of CSK itself by upstream kinases (such as PKA at Ser364 or ACK1 at Tyr18) can modulate its activity and stability, while SUMOylation of CSK has been reported to reduce its association with membrane adaptor proteins, leading to a decrease in its negative regulatory effect on SFKs (fortner2022apoptosisregulationby pages 4-6, sun2023dissectionofthe pages 5-6). Negative feedback loops are also evident; when SFKs are overactivated, there is an upregulation of CSK recruitment and/or activity that serves to restore signaling balance. In certain pathological conditions, alterations in these regulatory interactions—such as diminished CBP expression or altered post-translational modification patterns—have been linked to aberrant SFK signaling and oncogenic transformation (zhu2023regulationtargetsand pages 7-8, advani2017cskhomologouskinase(chk) pages 21-22).\n\n7. Function  \nCSK serves as a key negative regulator of Src family kinases and, by extension, of multiple signaling pathways that govern cell growth, differentiation, migration, and immune responses. Through the phosphorylation of a conserved C-terminal tyrosine residue on SFKs, CSK induces a conformational change in these kinases that promotes autoinhibition, effectively turning off their catalytic activity (roskoski2015srcproteintyrosinekinase pages 1-2, fortner2022apoptosisregulationby pages 2-4). In the context of immune cell signaling, CSK is crucial for maintaining proper thresholds of T-cell and B-cell receptor activation; by phosphorylating positive effectors like LCK and FYN, it suppresses overactive immune responses and contributes to the homeostasis of adaptive immunity (fortner2022apoptosisregulationby pages 4-6, zhu2023regulationtargetsand pages 8-8). Beyond its role in immune regulation, CSK is implicated in controlling cell adhesion and migration by suppressing aberrant SFK-driven signaling cascades, which in turn can impact processes such as metastasis and angiogenesis in cancer. Moreover, by modulating the activity of SFKs, CSK indirectly influences diverse cellular processes including apoptosis, proliferation, and differentiation, underscoring its role as a tumor suppressor in several cancer types (advani2017cskhomologouskinase(chk) pages 1-2, fortner2022apoptosisregulationby pages 9-11).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nGiven its central role in regulating SFK activity, CSK has become a target of interest in therapeutic research, particularly in the context of diseases such as cancer and immune disorders. Although specific small molecule inhibitors that directly target CSK remain less well characterized compared to those targeting SFKs, its regulatory axis is being indirectly modulated in clinical strategies. For example, in a clinical trial examining the novel ACK1 inhibitor (R)-9bMS in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, it has been noted that this compound not only suppresses androgen receptor signaling but also overcomes CSK-mediated restraint on LCK activity, thereby promoting an immune response against the tumor (NCT06705686). Additionally, chemical inhibitors that affect the CSK-SFK regulatory pathway, such as dasatinib, have been mentioned in the context of modulating Src family kinase activity, even though many of these agents are not selective for CSK alone (o’malley2020recentadvancesin pages 1-2, roskoski2015srcproteintyrosinekinase pages 5-6). Ongoing research is focused on better understanding the structural dynamics and regulatory interactions of CSK—such as the role of its SH2/SH3 domains and the intramolecular communication within its catalytic unit—as these insights may lead to the development of more selective inhibitors or modulators. Moreover, mutations or epigenetic alterations affecting CSK expression and function have been linked to various pathological conditions, underscoring its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in disease states marked by aberrant SFK signaling (zhu2023regulationtargetsand pages 7-8).\n\n9.

    "answer": "## 1. Phylogeny  \nMegakaryocyte‐associated tyrosine‐protein kinase (MATK), known alternatively as CSK homologous kinase, Hematopoietic consensus tyrosine‐lacking kinase, Protein kinase HYL, or Tyrosine‐protein kinase CTK, is situated within the non‐receptor tyrosine kinase superfamily with a specialized inhibitory role in controlling Src-family kinases. Phylogenetic analyses place MATK in close association with the CSK family, and its modular domain organization, notably comprising a catalytic kinase domain together with regulatory SH2 and SH3 domains, is a hallmark of kinases evolved to modulate Src kinase activity rather than to propagate an activating signal (advani2015cskhomologouskinase(chkmatk) pages 1-5). In contrast to typical Src kinases that contain motifs for autophosphorylation and membrane targeting, MATK lacks an N-terminal fatty acylation sequence and key autophosphorylation sites; this structural divergence reflects its evolution toward a predominantly inhibitory function. Studies indicate that within the human kinome the CSK family is highly conserved and can be traced back to an early common ancestor among vertebrates, with MATK representing a distinct branch that retains a high sequence conservation in both its catalytic core and its regulatory modules across diverse species including mammals, rodents, and primates (creeden2020kinomearrayprofiling pages 18-22). Comparative evolutionary analyses have shown that orthologs of MATK exist in many vertebrate lineages, maintaining not only overall high sequence identity but also conservation of the domain architecture that governs substrate interactions, such as the SH2 and SH3 regions that are critical for docking specific substrates and achieving intracellular targeting (rakshambikai2015typicalandatypical pages 6-9). Furthermore, structural comparisons among CSK homologous kinases underscore that although the catalytic machinery is preserved, the loss of motifs common in classical Src kinases, such as autophosphorylation sites, marks an evolutionary divergence from kinases involved in propagating growth signals to one that functions as a molecular “policeman” to ensure signaling fidelity in cells where excessive Src activation would be deleterious (ia2010structuralelementsand pages 1-6). The evolutionary depth of MATK is further supported by phylogenetic reconstructions that capture its placement in established families of tyrosine kinases, linking it to an ancient regulatory network essential for hematopoietic homeostasis in vertebrates.\n\n## 2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nMATK catalyzes a phosphorylation reaction typical for protein tyrosine kinases, where the enzyme transfers the γ-phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to a target tyrosine residue on substrate proteins. In the specific case of MATK, the primary substrate is the Src-family kinase, and its target is the conserved C-terminal regulatory tyrosine residue. The chemical reaction can be represented as:  \n\n  ATP + Src-family kinase (with free C-terminal tyrosine) → ADP + Src-family kinase (with phosphotyrosine) + H⁺  \n\nThis reaction is of critical importance because the phosphorylation of the C-terminal tyrosine induces intramolecular binding within the Src-family kinase—most notably, the phosphotyrosine interacts with the SH2 domain—thereby enforcing a closed, inactive conformation that attenuates kinase activity (ia2011definingthesubstrate pages 13-14). Experimental investigations have revealed that MATK is capable of phosphorylating multiple conformational variants of Src-family kinases, including both fully active and partially active forms; this wide substrate engagement is achieved by a dual mechanism that not only involves the conventional catalytic transfer of the phosphate group but also includes non-catalytic inhibitory binding that further stabilizes the inactive state (kfoury2014developingandoptimizing pages 17-26). The phosphorylation event thus serves as a regulatory checkpoint that prevents aberrant activation of downstream proliferative signaling cascades, playing an essential role in maintaining cellular signaling homeostasis in contexts such as hematopoietic and neuronal systems (advani2015cskhomologouskinase(chkmatk) pages 7-9). The intricately coordinated mechanism, which positions the phosphate acceptor suitably within MATK’s active site via its ATP-binding cleft and catalytic loop, is integral to its efficient functioning as a negative regulator of Src-family kinases.\n\n## 3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic efficacy of MATK is inherently dependent on the presence of essential cofactors that facilitate the phosphorylation reaction. Central to the enzymatic activity of MATK is the binding of ATP in coordination with a divalent metal ion, typically magnesium (Mg²⁺), which is indispensable for achieving a productive catalytic complex. Mg²⁺ functions by neutralizing the charge density of the ATP phosphates and stabilizing the transition state during phosphotransfer. This is achieved by binding to ATP to form an ATP–Mg²⁺ complex, which then undergoes proper orientation within the active site of MATK, thereby permitting the efficient transfer of the γ-phosphate group to the substrate tyrosine residue (creeden2022pancreaticcancerkinome pages 48-51). In certain experimental settings, manganese (Mn²⁺) has been observed to substitute for magnesium; however, under physiological conditions, magnesium is the predominant metal ion owing to its higher intracellular concentration and favorable coordination geometry with kinase active sites (rakshambikai2015typicalandatypical pages 6-9). Although additional cofactors have not been clearly implicated in MATK activity, the general paradigm for tyrosine kinase catalysis necessitates these metal ions, and MATK is no exception. Studies of CSK homologous kinases indicate that the ATP-bound state, stabilized by Mg²⁺, is crucial not only for catalytic phosphorylation but also for supporting non-catalytic inhibitory interactions through maintained conformational integrity (creeden2022pancreaticcancerkinome pages 48-51). The known dependence on ATP and Mg²⁺ constitutes a common mechanistic theme within the tyrosine kinase superfamily and underscores MATK’s conformity to this archetype.\n\n## 4. Substrate Specificity  \nMATK exhibits a high degree of substrate specificity that is central to its regulatory function in modulating the activity of Src-family kinases. Its preferred substrates comprise primarily the kinases within the Src family, such as Lyn, Fyn, and c-Src, wherein MATK targets the conserved C-terminal tyrosine residue for phosphorylation. The precise phosphorylation of this regulatory tyrosine is critical because it induces intramolecular interactions – particularly the binding of the phosphorylated tyrosine to the SH2 domain – which leads to the stabilization of an inactive kinase conformation (ia2011definingthesubstrate pages 13-14). MATK’s substrate specificity is mediated by its catalytic domain in conjunction with its accessory domains. The SH2 domain of MATK is known to bind phosphotyrosine-containing motifs, thereby facilitating the docking of substrates that already possess or can generate such signals (rakshambikai2015typicalandatypical pages 6-9). Concurrently, the SH3 domain recognizes proline-rich sequences typically present in Src-family kinases, thus enhancing the proximity and orientation of the substrate relative to the catalytic site. This dual-docking mechanism not only reinforces substrate specificity but also contributes to the effective inactivation of Src kinases via both catalytic and non-catalytic pathways (advani2015cskhomologouskinase(chkmatk) pages 7-9).  \nIn vitro studies have demonstrated that even subtle alterations in the amino acid sequence surrounding the target tyrosine residue can result in a marked decrease in the phosphorylation efficiency by MATK, highlighting the importance of a defined consensus recognition motif. Although a precise consensus motif for MATK has yet to be fully delineated, the reliability of substrate modification by MATK suggests that both the linear sequence and the three-dimensional structure around the phosphorylated tyrosine are critical determinants of its specificity (creeden2020kinomearrayprofiling pages 18-22). This stringent substrate requirement is crucial in ensuring that MATK selectively attenuates the proliferative signals initiated by Src-family kinases while sparing other tyrosine-based signaling components, thereby maintaining a balanced signaling network within hematopoietic cells.\n\n## 5. Structure  \nMATK’s structure exemplifies the characteristic features of the CSK-family kinases and is essential for its dual role as an enzyme executing catalytic phosphorylation as well as a regulatory scaffold mediating non-catalytic inhibition. At its core, MATK possesses a bilobal catalytic kinase domain, which is typical of the eukaryotic protein kinase family. The smaller N-terminal lobe, largely composed of β-sheets, primarily functions in the recognition and binding of ATP, while the larger C-terminal lobe, which is rich in α-helices, contains the catalytic loop and other motifs critical for phosphoryl transfer (ia2010structuralelementsand pages 1-6). Within the kinase domain, conserved structural elements such as the glycine-rich loop (often referred to as the P-loop) provide the requisite flexibility for ATP binding, and the catalytic loop contains key residues – including a conserved aspartate that functions as a catalytic base – necessary for phosphotransfer activity.  \nAdjacently, MATK contains protein–protein interaction modules such as the SH3 and SH2 domains. The SH3 domain typically binds to proline-rich sequences, whereas the SH2 domain engages phosphotyrosine-containing motifs; together, these modules play a vital role in substrate docking and spatial localization of MATK within the cell. Structural modeling studies, often using high-resolution crystallographic data from closely related kinases like CSK, indicate that the overall domain arrangement of MATK—with its central kinase domain flanked by SH2/SH3 modules—is evolutionarily conserved and critical for its function as an inhibitor of Src-family kinases (advani2015cskhomologouskinase(chkmatk) pages 5-7).  \nNotably, MATK lacks certain regions that are hallmarks of conventional Src kinases. It does not contain an N-terminal fatty acylation sequence that typically mediates membrane association, nor does it possess an autophosphorylation site within its activation loop, thereby emphasizing its specialized role in inhibitory signaling. Structural comparisons with CSK reveal that the ATP binding pocket of MATK is subtly different and may have evolved to favor specific interactions that underpin its inhibitory function rather than promote rapid catalytic turnover (advani2015cskhomologouskinase(chkmatk) pages 12-18). In addition, the rigidity of the overall domain architecture helps maintain the integrity of both the catalytic and non-catalytic interactions, with the SH2 and SH3 domains orienting the substrate to enable effective phosphorylation of the C-terminal inhibitory tyrosine on Src kinases (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 19-20). Advanced three-dimensional structural predictions, akin to those generated by the AlphaFold methodology, further confirm the conservation of essential structural motifs such as the catalytic loop, activation segment, and the P-loop, thereby reinforcing a model in which MATK is structurally optimized for its suppressive regulatory role.\n\n## 6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of MATK is multifactorial, involving transcriptional, post-translational, and allosteric mechanisms that together fine-tune its inhibitory activity. At the transcriptional level, the MATK gene features a promoter region rich in GC boxes and multiple transcription factor binding sites—including motifs for Sp1 and GATA-1—indicating a complex regulation that is responsive to both developmental cues and stress signals (advani2015cskhomologouskinase(chkmatk) pages 1-5). In several cancer types, particularly those of the hematopoietic system and colorectal origin, MATK gene expression is reduced due to hypermethylation of CpG islands in its promoter, an epigenetic modification that diminishes transcription and contributes to the loss of its inhibitory control over Src-family kinases (advani2015cskhomologouskinase(chkmatk) pages 1-5).  \nAt the post-translational level, MATK regulation encompasses dynamic phosphorylation events. Although MATK itself lacks a traditional autophosphorylation site in its activation loop, it is subject to phosphorylation at alternative residues that may modulate its kinase activity and its ability to form non-catalytic inhibitory complexes. Phosphorylation at such sites can induce subtle conformational changes that enhance the binding affinity of the SH2 and SH3 regions for their respective ligand motifs on target Src-family kinases (ia2011definingthesubstrate pages 13-14). Additionally, MATK’s activity is notably influenced by its ATP-binding status; binding of ATP not only is critical for catalysis but also stabilizes an allosterically active conformation that is required for effective non-catalytic inhibition of substrate kinases. Empirical studies have shown that mutations in key ATP-binding residues not only reduce the phosphorylation capacity of MATK but also abrogate its ability to physically interact with and inhibit Src-family kinases, demonstrating a tight coupling between nucleotide binding and regulatory function (sun2023dissectionofthe pages 1-2).  \nFurthermore, the delicate balance of MATK activity is susceptible to cancer-associated mutations that can occur within its catalytic core or regulatory domains. Missense mutations identified in tumor samples often map to the ATP-binding pocket or regions critical for substrate recognition, and such alterations are hypothesized to undermine MATK’s capacity to function as a brake on Src signaling. In this paradigm, loss-of-function mutations combined with epigenetic silencing contribute to the hyperactivation of Src kinases, promoting oncogenic progression (advani2015cskhomologouskinase(chkmatk) pages 7-9).  \nOverall, the regulation of MATK involves a synergistic interplay between gene expression controls, post-translational modifications, and conformational stabilization mechanisms that together ensure its precise inhibitory activity is deployed only when necessary. This multilayered regulation safeguards normal cellular homeostasis and prevents the oncogenic potential of unchecked Src kinase activation.\n\n## 7. Function  \nThe principal function of MATK is to serve as a negative regulator of Src-family kinases, an activity that is critical for preventing aberrant cell signaling events that could lead to uncontrolled proliferation or oncogenic transformation. By phosphorylating the conserved C-terminal regulatory tyrosine residue on Src-family kinases, MATK triggers an intramolecular reorganization that results in a closed, inactive conformation. This inactivation effectively dampens downstream signaling pathways associated with cell proliferation, survival, and migration (ia2011definingthesubstrate pages 13-14).  \nIn the context of hematopoietic tissues, MATK plays a vital role in the regulation of T-cell proliferation. Hematopoietic cells require a finely tuned balance of signaling cascades to properly mediate immune responses, and MATK’s function as an inhibitor of Src-family kinase activity ensures that T-cell activation and proliferation do not proceed unchecked. Reduced MATK expression or impaired function—due to epigenetic silencing or missense mutations—has been implicated in the aberrant activation of Src kinases, contributing to the progression of various cancers, including those of the blood and colon (advani2015cskhomologouskinase(chkmatk) pages 1-5).  \nFurthermore, MATK is also expressed in neural tissues such as the brain, where it is postulated to modulate neuronal signaling pathways. In these settings, the inhibition of Src-family kinases by MATK may influence synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival, although the precise mechanisms remain incompletely understood. The duality of MATK’s function—employing both catalytic phosphorylation and non-catalytic inhibitory binding—ensures a robust checkpoint mechanism that can restrain Src-family kinase activity even when these enzymes are partially activated (creeden2020kinomearrayprofiling pages 18-22).  \nGiven its central role in the negative regulation of kinases that are otherwise associated with proliferative and survival signals, MATK is increasingly recognized as a potential tumor suppressor. Experimental evidence demonstrating that diminished MATK activity correlates with constitutive Src activation supports the hypothesis that MATK dysfunction may contribute to the oncogenic process. Such findings have spurred interest in considering MATK expression levels as a biomarker for early detection of cancers in tissues where Src signaling is a predominant driver of pathology (creeden2022pancreaticcancerkinome pages 48-51).  \nIn summary, MATK functions as a critical inhibitory signal in multiple cellular contexts by ensuring that Src-family kinases remain in check. Its action is particularly important in the immune system and the brain, where tight control over kinase activity is essential for normal cellular function and prevention of disease.\n\n## 8. Other Comments  \nDespite significant progress in characterizing MATK’s biochemical and structural attributes, several challenges remain that warrant further investigation. One of the current hurdles is the lack of selective, high-affinity inhibitors that specifically target MATK. The dual mechanism of action—comprising both catalytic phosphorylation and non-catalytic inhibition—complicates the development of inhibitors that can effectively modulate MATK activity without off-target effects on other tyrosine kinases. Current research efforts are focused on deciphering the detailed ATP-dependent conformational dynamics of MATK and leveraging structural insights from its closest homologs, such as CSK, to identify potential inhibitor binding sites (creeden2020kinomearrayprofiling pages 18-22, advani2015cskhomologouskinase(chkmatk) pages 7-9).  \nIn addition to inhibitor development, disease associations linked to MATK further underline its clinical significance. Large-scale cancer genomic studies have identified multiple missense mutations in MATK, many of which cluster in functionally critical regions such as the ATP-binding pocket and substrate-interaction domains. These mutations are often correlated with hyperactivation of Src-family kinases, suggesting that loss or impairment of MATK activity could contribute to oncogenic transformation by removing an essential regulatory brake (advani2015cskhomologouskinase(chkmatk) pages 1-5, rakshambikai2015typicalandatypical pages 6-9).  \nSimilarly, epigenetic modifications leading to reduced MATK expression have been observed in various tumors, particularly those associated with hematopoietic and colorectal malignancies. Such observations provide a rationale for exploring strategies aimed at restoring MATK expression or function as potential therapeutic interventions, possibly through the use of demethylating agents or gene therapy approaches.  \nFurthermore, ongoing research is aimed at mapping the broader interactome of MATK in both hematopoietic and neural contexts. Elucidating the full spectrum of MATK’s substrates beyond the canonical Src-family members could reveal additional roles in cellular signaling networks and identify new points of therapeutic intervention. High-resolution structural studies, such as those employing cryo-electron microscopy or advanced predictive modeling techniques, are expected to yield further insights into how MATK’s domain architecture governs both its catalytic and non-catalytic modes of inhibition.  \nCurrent literature also suggests that while no MATK-specific inhibitors are commercially available, the identification of unique structural features in MATK versus other tyrosine kinases may lead to the design of next-generation compounds with improved selectivity. Researchers are investigating the possibility of targeting the distinct allosteric regulatory sites that contribute to MATK’s ATP-dependent conformational state, which are likely to be amenable to small-molecule intervention. Such strategies, if successful, may provide an innovative approach to restoring appropriate Src-family kinase regulation in cancers where MATK is deficient.  \nCollectively, these emerging research directions underscore the complexity and therapeutic potential of MATK. Its role as a critical checkpoint in Src-family kinase signaling not only highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis but also positions it as a compelling target for the development of novel anti-cancer strategies. Ongoing studies in this field promise to deepen our understanding of MATK’s regulatory mechanisms and to pave the way for innovative therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating tyrosine kinase signaling in disease states.\n\n## 9.

    "answer": "1. Phylogeny  \nMAPK6, commonly known as ERK3 or MAP kinase isoform p97, belongs to the atypical subclass of the MAPK family that distinguishes itself from classical MAPKs by possessing an unusual activation loop motif and unique regulatory features. Unlike conventional MAPKs such as ERK1/2 that are activated via a canonical three‐tier cascade involving MAP3K, MAP2K, and MAPK, ERK3 is characterized by the presence of a single phosphorylation acceptor within its Ser-Glu-Gly (SEG) activation motif. This atypical motif not only sets it apart functionally but also defines its evolutionary trajectory. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that ERK3/ MAPK6 is restricted to vertebrates, suggesting that its emergence is a relatively recent adaptation compared to the broadly conserved classical MAPKs found in all eukaryotes. Comparative studies have revealed that its kinase domain shares approximately 50% homology with conventional ERK1, yet its domain architecture and regulatory sequences such as the conserved C34 domain (shared with ERK4) highlight a divergence that is maintained across mammalian species and possibly other vertebrates (akunapuram2023regulationoferk3 pages 15-18, al2015identificationofnovel pages 19-23). Furthermore, experiments in which ERK3 is genetically ablated in animal models underscore its evolutionary conservation and developmental importance, indicating that despite being “atypical” from a regulatory mechanism standpoint, it represents an integral element of the MAPK signalling network conserved from the early vertebrate lineage (aldharee2017roleoferk3c pages 7-15, barbagallo2018exploringtherolesa pages 15-19). Thus, ERK3/MAPK6 is phylogenetically embedded within the CMGC group of kinases, sharing its broader classification with cyclin-dependent kinases, glycogen synthase kinases, and casein kinases, while its specific evolutionary adaptations reflect its specialized roles in vertebrate cellular physiology (albuquerque2024identificationdenouveaux pages 68-71).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nERK3 catalyzes the ATP-dependent transfer of a phosphate group to serine and threonine residues on its substrates, operating as a serine/threonine kinase. The classical reaction it mediates is of the form: ATP + [target protein] – OH → ADP + [target protein] – O‑phosphate + H⁺. In particular, ERK3 phosphorylates two well-documented substrates: microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and MAPK-activated protein kinase 5 (MAPKAPK5). Upon interaction with MAPKAPK5, ERK3 is phosphorylated on its activation loop residue Ser-189; this event is critical because it not only serves as a switch for activating ERK3 but also triggers subsequent phosphorylation events whereby ERK3 then phosphorylates and activates MAPKAPK5. Thereafter, MAPKAPK5 reciprocates the process by phosphorylating ERK3, establishing a regulatory feedback loop. Although the precise stoichiometry and kinetic parameters of these phosphorylation events are not fully characterized, the mechanism is understood to populate a sequential series of events wherein substrate recognition, binding, and catalysis proceed in an ordered manner resulting in cellular responses such as cell cycle progression (akunapuram2023regulationoferk3 pages 8-15, al2015identificationofnovelb pages 19-23).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of ERK3, like that of most serine/threonine kinases, is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions that serve as essential cofactors for effective ATP binding and phosphotransfer. In particular, Mg²⁺ is the central cofactor presumed to coordinate the ATP molecule in the enzyme’s catalytic site by stabilizing the negative charges of the phosphate groups, thereby facilitating nucleophilic attack during the transfer reaction. Although detailed studies on the potential involvement of other metal ions such as Mn²⁺ are not elaborated in the current literature, the structural conservation observed in the kinase domains of similarly related MAPKs strongly suggests that Mg²⁺ is the primary cofactor required for ERK3 activity. Additionally, conserved motifs within the kinase domain, such as the AXK motif that includes a key catalytic lysine, contribute to the coordination of ATP and ensure the integrity of the catalytic mechanism (dahm2025atypicalmapksin pages 1-3, akunapuram2023regulationoferk3 pages 15-18).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nThe substrate specificity of ERK3 distinguishes it from classical MAPKs through its restricted repertoire of physiological targets and the reliance on specific protein–protein interactions for substrate recognition. Notable substrates for ERK3 include microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), which plays an instrumental role in modulating microtubule dynamics and cytoskeletal organization, and MAPK-activated protein kinase 5 (MAPKAPK5), also known as MK5 or PRAK, which forms a stable complex with ERK3. In this complex, the initial binding to MAPKAPK5 triggers phosphorylation of ERK3 at the activation loop residue Ser-189, an event necessary for the activation of MAPKAPK5. The reciprocal nature of this interaction, where MAPKAPK5 also phosphorylates ERK3, strongly implies a tightly coordinated regulatory mechanism governing downstream signal transduction processes such as cell cycle entry and cytoskeletal rearrangement (akunapuram2023regulationoferk3 pages 8-15, bi2018receptorlikecytoplasmickinases pages 18-21). Although a consensus substrate motif exclusive for ERK3 has not been definitively delineated in the literature, its substrate recognition appears to involve docking sequences and structural features that differ from the classical D-domain interactions observed in other MAPKs. This specificity is further reinforced by the observation that ERK3 does not efficiently phosphorylate a broad array of conventional MAPK substrates like c-Jun or MyoD, instead demonstrating a narrow substrate range that supports its specialized role in cell cycle progression and cytoskeletal control (boguckajanczi2023erk3mapk6dictatescdc42rac1 pages 1-4, akunapuram2023regulationoferk3 pages 15-18).\n\n5. Structure  \nThe structural organization of ERK3 is emblematic of the MAP kinase family yet incorporates several atypical features that distinguish it from classic kinases such as ERK1/2. The protein can be broadly divided into three main segments:  \n • The N-terminal kinase domain: This globular domain, comprising approximately 720 amino acids overall with about 50% homology to ERK1’s catalytic domain, harbors the catalytic core responsible for ATP binding and phosphate transfer. Key to its activity is the atypical activation loop, which, unlike the canonical TXY motif found in conventional MAPKs, contains a single phosphorylatable site within the SEG motif (Ser-189). This residue is critical for kinase activity and modulates substrate binding, particularly in the context of its interaction with MAPKAPK5 (akunapuram2023regulationoferk3 pages 15-18, dahm2025atypicalmapksin pages 1-3).  \n • The conserved C34 domain: Unique to the ERK3/ERK4 subfamily, the C34 domain is highly conserved among vertebrates and is absent from classical MAP kinases. Although its specific function remains incompletely defined, the C34 region is implicated in mediating protein–protein interactions that are essential for the stable formation of complexes, such as that observed with MAPKAPK5, and may contribute to subcellular localization dynamics (al2015identificationofnovel pages 19-23, barbagallo2018exploringtherolesa pages 19-24).  \n • The extended C-terminal tail: This region is characterized by a high concentration of serine/threonine residues, which serve as potential sites for additional phosphorylation and regulatory modifications. The C-terminal tail is believed to play a significant role in modulating kinase stability, protein–protein interactions, and possibly intracellular trafficking. Structural modeling and crystallographic studies suggest that the atypical nature of the activation loop combined with the extended tail imparts ERK3 with its characteristic regulatory behavior distinct from the more rigidly structured classical MAPKs (akunapuram2023regulationoferk3 pages 15-18, albuquerque2024identificationdenouveauxa pages 68-71).  \nOverall, the bilobal architecture common to serine/threonine kinases is maintained, with the N-terminal lobe primarily binding ATP and the C-terminal lobe contributing to substrate specificity. However, the divergence in the activation loop, the presence of the C34 domain, and the extended C-terminal tail are structural hallmarks that underlie the unique functional properties of ERK3 (barbagallo2018exploringtheroles pages 15-19, elkhadragy2017regulationofthe pages 17-22).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of ERK3 is multifaceted and encompasses a spectrum of post-translational modifications and protein–protein interactions that fine-tune its activity, stability, and localization. One of the central regulatory events is the phosphorylation of the activation loop, specifically at the Ser-189 residue located in the SEG motif. This phosphorylation is critical for activating ERK3’s kinase activity, and it is mediated either via autophosphorylation or by upstream kinases such as group I p21-activated kinases (PAKs) (akunapuram2023regulationoferk3 pages 15-18, aldharee2017roleoferk3c pages 7-15). Once phosphorylated, ERK3 can engage in a reciprocal relationship with MAPKAPK5; binding of MAPKAPK5 leads to further phosphorylation of ERK3 and, in return, ERK3 phosphorylates and activates MAPKAPK5, establishing a regulatory complex that is thought to promote cell cycle entry and other downstream signaling events (boguckajanczi2023erk3mapk6dictatescdc42rac1 pages 12-15, barbagallo2018exploringtheroles pages 19-24).  \nIn addition to phosphorylation, ERK3 is subject to ubiquitination-mediated proteolysis, which contributes to its notably short half-life in proliferating cells. Specific motifs within its N-terminal region act as degradation signals, and ubiquitination targets ERK3 for proteasomal degradation. The stability of ERK3 is counteracted by deubiquitinating enzymes such as USP20, which remove ubiquitin chains and thereby stabilize the kinase, ensuring its availability for signaling functions such as promoting cell migration (elkhadragy2019aradioactivein pages 7-9, barbagallo2018exploringtheroles pages 74-76).  \nFurthermore, additional regulatory phosphorylation events have been identified within the extended C-terminal tail of ERK3. These phosphorylations, occurring on multiple serine/threonine residues, are often cell cycle–dependent and correlate with enhanced protein stability during mitosis. The precise kinases involved in modifying the C-terminal tail are still under investigation, but evidence suggests that cyclin-dependent kinases such as Cyclin B-Cdk1 may be involved, with subsequent dephosphorylation by phosphatases potentially triggering degradation upon mitotic exit (elkhadragy2024roleofthe pages 15-16, barbagallo2018exploringtherolesa pages 15-19).  \nSubcellular localization also plays a key role in regulating ERK3 function. Although ERK3 lacks classical nuclear localization signals, its distribution between the nucleus and cytoplasm is controlled by its regulatory domains and may be affected by post-translational modifications. The binding of ERK3 to proteins such as MAPKAPK5 has been implicated in facilitating cytoplasmic retention, while its phosphorylation status can influence nuclear export signals, with CRM1-dependent mechanisms mediating nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling (elkhadragy2024roleofthe pages 11-13, bi2018receptorlikecytoplasmickinases pages 18-21).  \nCollectively, the regulation of ERK3 is emblematic of an atypical kinase that integrates multiple layers of control—from activation loop phosphorylation and reciprocal kinase interactions to ubiquitin-mediated degradation and spatial localization effects—to ensure that its signaling output is precise and context-dependent (akunapuram2023regulationoferk3 pages 15-18, dahm2025atypicalmapksin pages 1-3).\n\n7. Function  \nERK3 exerts its biological functions through a combination of its enzymatic activity and its capacity to form multi-kinase complexes. One of the primary roles of ERK3 appears to be the regulation of cell cycle progression. The reciprocal phosphorylation cycle established between ERK3 and MAPKAPK5 is believed to drive cell cycle entry by triggering signaling pathways that transition cells from quiescence to proliferation. Despite remaining “atypical” in its activation relative to canonical MAPKs, the ERK3–MAPKAPK5 complex has been functionally associated with promoting mitogenic responses (akunapuram2023regulationoferk3 pages 15-18, alsaran2016functionalcharacterizationof pages 8-15).  \nIn addition to its cell cycle regulatory role, ERK3 has been implicated in the control of cytoskeletal dynamics, a function closely linked to its phosphorylation of substrates such as MAP2. By phosphorylating MAP2, ERK3 can influence microtubule organization and, by extension, regulate processes such as cell morphology, migration, and potentially invasion. This function is particularly relevant in the context of cancer, where increased ERK3 expression and activity have been correlated with enhanced cell motility and metastatic phenotypes in tumor models (boguckajanczi2023erk3mapk6dictatescdc42rac1 pages 1-4, barbagallo2018exploringtheroles pages 15-19).  \nMoreover, ERK3 is widely expressed in various tissues including skeletal muscle, brain, and multiple epithelial cell types, indicating its involvement in diverse physiological processes. Its developmental regulation, as evidenced by increasing mRNA levels during embryogenesis followed by tissue-specific expression in adults, suggests that ERK3 contributes to tissue differentiation and organ maturation. Genetic studies in model organisms have demonstrated that perturbations in ERK3 expression can lead to defects in tissue development and homeostasis (aldharee2017roleoferk3c pages 7-15, elkhadragy2024roleofthe pages 1-2).  \nBeyond cell cycle and cytoskeletal regulation, ERK3 has also been implicated in broader signal transduction networks. Its interactions with coactivators and transcriptional regulators, such as the interplay with MAPKAPK5 and potential indirect effects on proteins like SRC-3, suggest a role in integrating mitogenic and stress signals. This places ERK3 as a nodal point where atypical MAPK signaling converges with other pathways that regulate cellular responses to environmental cues, thereby impacting proliferation, differentiation, and survival (barbagallo2018exploringtheroles pages 19-24, akunapuram2023regulationoferk3 pages 8-15).  \nFinally, while ERK3 is predominantly studied in the context of cancer due to its association with increased invasiveness and altered signaling in tumor cells, its roles in immune cell function and inflammatory signaling are also emerging. For instance, there is evidence to suggest that ERK3 may influence thymocyte development and T-cell activation, further underlining its involvement in discrete aspects of cell regulation beyond cytoskeletal dynamics and proliferation (elkhadragy2017regulationofthe pages 22-26, albuquerque2024identificationdenouveauxa pages 68-71).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral additional facets of ERK3 regulation and function warrant further discussion. First, the development of selective inhibitors for ERK3 remains in its early stages. Owing to its atypical activation mechanism and the unique features of its ATP-binding pocket and regulatory domains, standard kinase inhibitors display off-target effects when applied to ERK3. Current efforts are focused on identifying molecules that can selectively target the unique structural features of ERK3 without broadly inhibiting other MAPK family members; however, such compounds are not yet widely available in clinical practice (albuquerque2024identificationdenouveaux pages 68-71, schroder2020crystalstructureand pages 10-12).  \nSecond, disease associations of ERK3 are becoming increasingly evident, particularly in oncology. Increased expression and dysregulated activity of ERK3 have been observed in various cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma and breast cancer, where its kinase activity is linked to enhanced cell migration, invasiveness, and potential chemoresistance. Furthermore, certain cancer-associated mutations, such as alterations in the L290 residue, have been reported to influence both the subcellular localization and functional output of ERK3. These mutations may enhance cytosolic localization, thereby promoting interactions with cytoplasmic substrates and signaling molecules that drive oncogenic processes (elkhadragy2024roleofthe pages 11-13, barbagallo2018exploringtheroles pages 74-76).  \nThird, the interplay between phosphorylation and ubiquitination in regulating ERK3 stability offers promising avenues for therapeutic intervention. The rapid turnover of ERK3, mediated by ubiquitination events at its N-terminal regions, is counterbalanced by deubiquitinating enzymes such as USP20. This balance is critical for maintaining appropriate levels of active kinase in the cell and suggests that modulation of these regulatory processes could be exploited to alter ERK3 activity in pathological conditions (elkhadragy2019aradioactivein pages 7-9, barbagallo2018exploringtherolesa pages 15-19).  \nFinally, current research is oriented toward elucidating the broader network of interacting proteins and the complete spectrum of downstream substrates associated with ERK3. High-throughput proteomic approaches coupled with advanced data analysis techniques are being employed to map the transient phosphorylation events coordinated by ERK3, with the goal of fully integrating its role within the complex signaling milieu of the cell. These studies are critical for uncovering novel interactions and identifying additional regulatory checkpoints that could serve as targets for therapeutic intervention in diseases where ERK3 signaling is aberrant (akunapuram2023regulationoferk3 pages 15-18, boguckajanczi2023erk3mapk6dictatescdc42rac1 pages 12-15).\n\n9.

    "answer": "1. Phylogeny  \nMitogen‐activated protein kinase 7 (MAPK7), also known as ERK5, BMK1, or PRKM7, is a member of the MAP kinase family that belongs to the CMGC group of protein kinases. It is evolutionarily distinct from classical ERKs (such as ERK1/2), p38 kinases, and JNKs due to its unique long C‐terminal extension, which houses a transcriptional activation domain; this structural addition sets it apart phylogenetically from its paralogs (le2023thesignificanceof pages 1-3, paudel2021themek5erk5pathway pages 1-2). MAPK7 is observed in a wide range of eukaryotic organisms, indicating that it has evolved from a common ancestor and is conserved across mammalian species as well as more distantly related species, such as Caenorhabditis elegans where the orthologous kinase, SMA-5, regulates intestinal intermediate filament organization (geisler2023intermediatefilamentnetwork pages 1-2). Within the kinome, MAPK7 occupies a unique niche along the MEK5/ERK5 signaling axis, and its upstream activator, the MAP kinase kinase MAP2K5, is specific for its activation; notably, MAP2K5 and MAPK7 operate independently of the commonly studied MEK1/ERK1/2 route (paudel2021themek5erk5pathway pages 1-2, le2023thesignificanceof pages 1-3). These evolutionary relationships underscore an ancient signaling module that has diverged to fulfill specialized functions such as transcriptional regulation and cytoprotective signaling in diverse tissues, including the heart, endothelium, and muscle (le2023thesignificanceof pages 12-13, paudel2021themek5erk5pathway pages 21-21).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nMAPK7 functions as a serine/threonine protein kinase whose catalytic activity involves the transfer of the γ‐phosphate from ATP to specific serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins. The generalized chemical reaction can be summarized as:  \n  ATP + [protein]–(L‑serine/threonine) → ADP + [protein]–(L‑serine/threonine)‐phosphate + H⁺  \nThis phosphorylation event alters the conformation, activity, or subcellular localization of the substrate, thereby modulating downstream signaling pathways. MAPK7 phosphorylates key substrates such as MEF2C—a transcription factor that regulates gene expression during differentiation and proliferation—as well as SGK1 at Ser-78, which is essential for growth factor–induced cell cycle progression. In cardiomyocytes, MAPK7 also acts to suppress apoptosis by disrupting the interaction between PML and MDM2, thereby influencing p53/TP53 stability and activity (Information, paudel2021themek5erk5pathway pages 2-3, le2023thesignificanceof pages 13-13). The reaction mechanism, similar to other protein kinases, proceeds through the binding of ATP to the kinase’s catalytic cleft, followed by the coordination of divalent metal ions and subsequent nucleophilic attack by the hydroxyl group of the substrate’s serine or threonine residue (pei2023computationalanalysisof pages 1-2, moustardas2023mapkpathwaysin pages 1-3).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of MAPK7 is dependent on the binding of ATP as a phosphate donor, a common requirement among protein kinases. In addition, map kinases typically require divalent metal ions such as Mg²⁺ to facilitate proper binding and orientation of ATP in the catalytic pocket. Although experimental details specific to MAPK7’s cofactor dependency are not extensively detailed in the provided context, the overall reaction mechanism for protein kinases, including the CMGC subfamily to which MAPK7 belongs, consistently shows a requirement for Mg²⁺ ions (pei2023computationalanalysisof pages 2-4, moustardas2023mapkpathwaysin pages 1-3).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nMAPK7 exhibits substrate specificity toward serine/threonine residues within target proteins that are critical for mediating its diverse biological functions. One well‐characterized substrate is the transcription factor MEF2C, whose phosphorylation is pivotal in mediating gene expression related to cell differentiation and survival. Additionally, MAPK7 phosphorylates SGK1 at Ser-78; this modification is necessary for growth factor–induced cell cycle progression (Information). The specificity of MAPK7 is determined not only by the primary sequence of substrates but also by docking motifs within the target proteins that interact with specific regions in the MAPK7 catalytic domain. The kinase is known to be regulated by signals emanating from receptors such as EGF receptors via a Ras‐independent, MAP2K5‐dependent pathway, further emphasizing its distinct substrate recognition mechanism compared to classical MAPKs like ERK1/2 (paudel2021themek5erk5pathway pages 1-2, le2023thesignificanceof pages 8-9). Although detailed consensus motifs analogous to the RxRxxp[ST] for other kinases are not explicitly provided in the context, the presence of a conserved TEY motif within the activation loop of MAPK7 and its requirement for precise phosphorylation events underscore its selective catalytic action (le2023thesignificanceof pages 3-4, paudel2021themek5erk5pathway pages 2-3).\n\n5. Structure  \nMAPK7 is organized into multiple distinct domains that confer its dual functionality as both a kinase and a transcriptional activator. The protein features an N-terminal kinase domain that shares approximately 50% sequence identity with the classical ERK1/2 kinases. This kinase domain contains critical structural elements such as the ATP-binding site, catalytic loop (CL), and the activation loop that includes conserved phosphorylation sites (e.g., T218 and Y220, as well as additional regulatory sites) necessary for its catalytic activation by its specific upstream activator, MAP2K5 (le2023thesignificanceof pages 1-3, paudel2021themek5erk5pathway pages 1-2). One of the unique structural features of MAPK7 is its large C-terminal extension, which encompasses a transcriptional activation domain (TAD) along with a nuclear localization signal (NLS). This C-terminal region is responsible for mediating the nuclear translocation of MAPK7 upon activation and directly engaging in transcriptional regulation by interfacing with target transcription factors such as MEF2C (le2023thesignificanceof pages 7-8, paudel2021themek5erk5pathway pages 1-2).  \nRecent computational studies and AlphaFold predictions have illuminated additional features such as a CMGC-insert within the kinase domain and a distal C-terminal segment that appears to adopt an autoinhibitory conformation by interacting with the ATP-binding cleft, thereby modulating kinase activity (pei2023computationalanalysisof pages 10-12, pei2023computationalanalysisof pages 15-16). Key catalytic residues, including those involved in coordinating ATP and Mg²⁺ ions, as well as residues within docking sites for substrate recognition, have been conserved across species. The interplay between the catalytic domain and the transcriptional activation domain is central to the bifunctional role of MAPK7, enabling it to act as both a conventional kinase and a regulator of gene expression upon nuclear entry (le2023thesignificanceof pages 12-13, paudel2021themek5erk5pathway pages 17-18).\n\n6. Regulation  \nMAPK7 is tightly regulated by a combination of upstream kinases, intramolecular autophosphorylation events, and interactions with regulatory proteins. Activation of MAPK7 is primarily driven by phosphorylation at its activation loop—specifically at residues within the TEY motif—by its dedicated upstream kinase, MAP2K5. This dual phosphorylation not only activates the kinase activity of MAPK7 but also initiates autophosphorylation events in the C-terminal region, which are essential for its nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation (le2023thesignificanceof pages 1-3, paudel2021themek5erk5pathway pages 1-2).  \nIn addition to MAP2K5, alternative phosphorylation events can occur via kinases such as CDK1, CDK5, and ERK2 under specific cellular conditions including mitotic arrest or stress responses, thereby modulating MAPK7’s transcriptional and catalytic outputs. An important regulatory phosphorylation is at T733 within the C-terminal transactivation domain; when phosphorylated, this residue acts as a gatekeeper to promote nuclear localization and facilitate subsequent target gene activation, particularly of MEF2-dependent transcripts (paudel2021themek5erk5pathway pages 2-3, le2023thesignificanceof pages 4-5).  \nMAPK7 is also subject to interaction with molecular chaperones such as HSP90 and CDC37 under resting conditions, which maintain the kinase in a closed, inactive conformation. Upon activation, these interactions are disrupted, enabling MAPK7 to adopt an open conformation suitable for substrate binding and catalytic activity (paudel2021themek5erk5pathway pages 1-2). Negative regulation is exemplified in cardiomyocytes where MAPK7 interacts with STUB1/CHIP, promoting the ubiquitination and degradation of ICER-type isoforms of CREM, thus attenuating pro-apoptotic signals (Information, le2023thesignificanceof pages 13-13). Further regulation may involve feedback mechanisms modulated by post-translational modifications such as SUMOylation and ubiquitination, although detailed mapping of these regulatory modifications remains an active area of research (le2023thesignificanceof pages 11-12, paudel2021themek5erk5pathway pages 15-17).\n\n7. Function  \nMAPK7 plays a central role in diverse biological processes by integrating extracellular signals into appropriate intracellular responses via its dual kinase and transcriptional activities. In proliferating cells, MAPK7 is activated by growth factors such as EGF through a Ras-independent but MAP2K5-dependent pathway, triggering nuclear translocation where it phosphorylates transcription factors like MEF2C to regulate gene expression programs important for differentiation and proliferation (Information, paudel2021themek5erk5pathway pages 1-2, le2023thesignificanceof pages 1-3).  \nIn cardiomyocytes, MAPK7 exerts anti-apoptotic effects by engaging with STUB1/CHIP to promote the ubiquitination and degradation of ICER-type isoforms of CREM, thereby contributing to cell survival during stress (Information, le2023thesignificanceof pages 7-8). It also phosphorylates SGK1 at Ser-78, a modification that is required for growth factor–induced cell cycle progression, highlighting its role in regulating cellular proliferation (Information).  \nMAPK7 has been implicated in muscle cell differentiation, where its activation supports myogenic gene expression and differentiation processes, and it may be critical for maintaining endothelial function and vascular integrity. In endothelial cells, the activation of MAPK7 via mechanical stimuli such as laminar shear stress contributes to vasoprotective gene expression – for instance, the upregulation of Krüppel-like factors (KLF2 and KLF4) that support blood vessel integrity and anti-inflammatory responses (paudel2021themek5erk5pathway pages 7-9, le2023thesignificanceof pages 5-6). Moreover, MAPK7 is involved in the regulation of p53/TP53 function by disrupting the PML-MDM2 interaction, thereby impacting cell cycle checkpoints and apoptosis (Information, paudel2021themek5erk5pathway pages 2-3).  \nCollectively, MAPK7 serves as a bifunctional signaling mediator whose roles extend from cell cycle regulation and differentiation to cytoprotection in stress-responsive tissues, marking it as a promising target in therapeutic strategies for cancer, cardiovascular disease, and vascular disorders (le2023thesignificanceof pages 6-7, paudel2021themek5erk5pathway pages 15-17).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nCurrently, no clinical trials have been registered that specifically target MAPK7, indicating that the clinical development of inhibitors for this kinase is in its infancy or that efforts remain limited to preclinical studies (Clinical Trial Search: AREA[InterventionName]ERK5 OR AREA[InterventionName]MAPK7 OR AREA[InterventionName]BMK1 OR AREA[InterventionName]PRKM7 OR AREA[Condition]MAPK7 OR AREA[Condition]ERK5 OR AREA[Condition]BMK1 OR AREA[Condition]PRKM7). The Open Targets platform similarly reports only limited genetic associations for MAPK7, with a modest link to certain phenotypes such as carnitine measurement, suggesting that while MAPK7 is a promising target, its role in disease requires further elucidation (OpenTargets Search: -MAPK7).  \nSeveral inhibitors targeting ERK5/MAPK7 have been reported in the literature. For instance, compounds such as XMD8-92 have been used in preclinical settings to interrogate MAPK7’s function; however, some ERK5 inhibitors have paradoxical effects by inducing transcriptional activation, highlighting the complexity of its bifunctional regulation (paudel2021themek5erk5pathway pages 15-17, le2023thesignificanceof pages 13-13). These inhibitors are mainly used as research tools rather than as clinical candidates, and further optimization regarding specificity and efficacy is an active area of research.  \nDisease associations for MAPK7 include various cancers (such as melanoma, colon, and triple-negative breast cancer) where its activation serves as an escape mechanism during MAPK inhibitor treatment, as well as cardiovascular conditions in which MAPK7 contributes to endothelial survival and maintenance of vascular integrity. Additionally, its role in muscle differentiation and regulation of p53/TP53 signaling underscores its involvement in developmental and stress response pathways (Information, paudel2021themek5erk5pathway pages 2-3, le2023thesignificanceof pages 11-12). Notable mutations specific to MAPK7 have yet to be clearly defined, and current studies focus more on its regulation through post-translational modifications rather than on mutation-driven dysregulation.  \nOverall, MAPK7 remains a subject of intense basic and translational research due to its multifunctional roles and potential as a therapeutic target in diseases characterized by dysregulated cell growth, apoptosis, and stress responses (le2023thesignificanceof pages 5-6, paudel2021themek5erk5pathway pages 17-18).\n\n9.

    "answer": "1. Phylogeny  \nMAPK15, also known as ERK7 or ERK8, is classified as an atypical mitogen‐activated protein kinase that diverges from the canonical ERK1/2, p38, JNK and ERK5 subfamilies. Unlike the classical MAPKs that are activated through three‐tier kinase cascades (MAP3K → MAP2K → MAPK), MAPK15 occupies an evolutionarily distinct branch of the MAPK family that appears to have diverged early from the ancestral MAPK lineage. Sequence analyses indicate that mammalian ERK8 (MAPK15) shares approximately 69% amino acid identity with its rat ortholog ERK7, yet the divergence is greater than that seen with typical ortholog pairs, suggesting that MAPK15/ERK7/ERK8 represents a distinct evolutionary entity within the CMGC group—that is, the group of kinases that includes cyclin‐dependent, MAP and glycogen synthase kinases. This kinase is conserved across a wide range of eukaryotes, and its orthologs have been identified not only in mammals but also in early‐branching unicellular organisms and in apicomplexan parasites, where related atypical MAPKs (often referred to using similar names such as ERK7) have been implicated in functions like daughter cell budding and ciliogenesis. Thus, within the kinome, MAPK15 is part of a specialized and evolutionarily ancient subgroup that exhibits unique regulatory and structural features compared to conventional MAPKs (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8, dahm2025atypicalmapksin pages 1-3, o’shaughnessy2022notyourmother’s pages 2-5).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nMAPK15 functions as a protein serine/threonine kinase that catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to specific serine or threonine residues in substrate proteins. The canonical reaction can be summarized as: ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(phospho-L-serine/threonine) + H⁺. Although the detailed reaction mechanism is typical of the MAPK family—with the kinase domain adopting an active conformation upon phosphorylation of the activation loop—the precise substrates and the consensus sequence recognized by MAPK15 remain incompletely defined. In vitro studies have demonstrated that MAPK15 can phosphorylate substrates such as myelin basic protein (MBP) and transcription factors such as FOS; additionally, phosphorylation of c-Jun and potentially other proline-directed motifs has been observed, which is in line with the general substrate specificity seen among MAP kinases (klevernic2006characterizationofthe pages 1-2, abe1999extracellularsignalregulatedkinase pages 10-11). However, physiological substrates that reliably reflect its true cellular functions are still a matter of ongoing investigation (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 8-9).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nAs with many protein kinases, the catalytic activity of MAPK15 is dependent on the presence of ATP and divalent metal ions. ATP serves as the phosphoryl donor in the reaction, while metal ions—most notably Mg²⁺—are required to stabilize the phosphate groups of ATP in the kinase active site. The Mg²⁺ ion coordinates with conserved residues in the catalytic domain, facilitating the proper orientation of ATP and the substrate for efficient phosphotransfer. Although no unusual cofactors have been reported for MAPK15, these general cofactor requirements (ATP and Mg²⁺) are a common feature of serine/threonine kinases within the CMGC group (nguyen2015coconservedmapkfeatures pages 6-8, huang2024reconstructingthedeep pages 1-3).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nThe substrate specificity of MAPK15 has not been as rigorously defined as that of classical MAPKs. In vitro experiments have shown that MAPK15 phosphorylates classical MAPK substrates, including myelin basic protein (MBP) and the transcription factor FOS. In some studies, phosphorylation of c-Jun on key serine residues was also observed, suggesting that MAPK15 may recognize phosphorylation motifs analogous to the proline-directed consensus motifs (Ser/Thr followed by proline) found in other MAP kinases. This preference for S/T-P motifs is consistent with the substrate recognition pattern observed in the MAPK family, although the unique structural features of MAPK15—including its atypical activation loop and extended C-terminal domain—could impart additional substrate selectivity. Despite these in vitro findings, the validation of endogenous substrates has proven challenging; indeed, only a limited number of physiological substrates have been firmly associated with MAPK15 in vivo. As a result, while its potential to phosphorylate proline-directed substrates is evident, the detailed consensus sequence that confers substrate specificity remains under active research (dahm2025atypicalmapksin pages 7-8, klevernic2006characterizationofthe pages 1-2, cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 8-9).\n\n5. Structure  \nMAPK15 features a canonical serine/threonine kinase domain characteristic of the MAPK family, displaying the conserved catalytic motifs necessary for ATP binding and phosphoryl transfer. A key structural hallmark is the presence of the TEY motif within its activation loop, which is subject to autophosphorylation—a mechanism that appears to be the primary means of activation for this atypical kinase. Unique to MAPK15 is a long C-terminal extension that is absent in classical MAPKs; this extension is thought to play important roles in dictating subcellular localization, regulating autoactivation, and mediating protein-protein interactions with partners such as chromatin-associated factors and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Additionally, the N-terminal region contains signals that target MAPK15 for ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation, thereby influencing its cellular abundance and functional output. Structural predictions, including those from Alphafold-based models, indicate that the C-terminal extension is likely to be intrinsically disordered, which might facilitate its interaction with a range of regulatory proteins. Despite the absence of high-resolution crystal structures for the full-length protein, the conserved kinase domain bears the typical bilobal structure observed in MAP kinases, with critical residues including the ATP-binding lysine and other motifs (such as the HRD and DFG motifs) being preserved. These features underscore the dual nature of MAPK15: while its catalytic core aligns with that of conventional MAPKs, its flanking regions confer unique regulatory properties (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8, dahm2025atypicalmapksin pages 7-8, huang2024reconstructingthedeep pages 14-16).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of MAPK15 is multifaceted, relying on mechanisms that are distinct from the canonical MAPK cascade. A major regulatory mechanism involves autophosphorylation of the TEY motif within the activation loop, which is thought to confer constitutive kinase activity in some contexts. This autoactivation bypasses the need for phosphorylation by upstream MAP2Ks, a feature that sets MAPK15 apart from conventional MAPKs that require a three-tiered activation cascade. In addition to autophosphorylation, MAPK15 is subject to regulation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The N-terminal region of the kinase contains sequences that target it for ubiquitination, leading to rapid turnover and a relatively short half-life under basal conditions. Moreover, the unique C-terminal extension not only influences subcellular localization—enabling nuclear translocation via embedded nuclear localization signals—but also modulates interactions with other regulatory proteins. For instance, binding to PCNA through its C-terminal motifs has been shown to protect genomic integrity by preventing MDM2-mediated PCNA degradation. External stimuli, such as serum, oxidative stress (e.g., H₂O₂ treatment), and amino acid starvation, further modulate MAPK15 activity and localization, thereby linking it to cellular stress responses and metabolic regulation. Although the identity of upstream activators remains largely unknown, these regulatory inputs together suggest a complex network involving post-translational modifications (phosphorylation, ubiquitination) and protein–protein interactions that fine-tune MAPK15 activity (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8, dahm2025atypicalmapksin pages 7-8, klevernic2006characterizationofthe pages 1-2, o’shaughnessy2022notyourmother’s pages 7-8).\n\n7. Function  \nMAPK15 plays diverse and critical roles in cell physiology that are executed in both kinase activity-dependent and -independent manners. Its functions encompass the regulation of autophagy, primary cilium formation, intracellular protein trafficking, and the maintenance of genome integrity. In the context of autophagy, MAPK15 interacts with autophagy-related proteins such as GABARAP, MAP1LC3B, and GABARAPL1. Through these interactions, it promotes the formation of autophagosomes, facilitates SQSTM1 degradation, and reduces inhibitory phosphorylation of MAP1LC3B, thereby modulating both basal autophagy and starvation-induced autophagy. MAPK15 also has a pivotal role in ciliogenesis—it governs not only the formation of the primary cilium but also the proper localization of ciliary proteins that are essential for cilium structure, transport, and signal transduction. In addition, MAPK15 appears to restrict the production of sugar-coated proteins by preventing the mislocalization of glycosylation enzymes; by inhibiting their relocation from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum, MAPK15 thereby confines the production of certain glycoproteins. Under conditions of amino acid starvation, MAPK15 mediates the disassembly of transitional endoplasmic reticulum sites and concomitantly inhibits secretion. Moreover, MAPK15 binds to chromatin and interacts with PCNA; this interaction is significant for safeguarding genome stability by preventing the MDM2-mediated degradation of PCNA, which is a central component of the DNA replication and repair machinery. Additional reports indicate that MAPK15 can regulate dopamine transporter (DAT) activity via activation of RhoA and modulate mRNA stability—specifically, in response to H₂O₂ treatment, it phosphorylates ELAVL1, thereby interfering with PDCD4 mRNA binding and promoting its degradation. There is also evidence suggesting a role in oocyte maturation where it contributes to microtubule organization and meiotic cell cycle progression. Collectively, these multiple roles implicate MAPK15 as an important integrator of cellular stress responses, metabolic control, and cell cycle regulation (dahm2025atypicalmapksin pages 1-3, o’shaughnessy2022notyourmother’s pages 8-10, cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nDespite its recognized importance, there remains a significant gap in the availability of specific inhibitors targeting MAPK15. To date, no highly selective catalytic inhibitors for MAPK15 have been thoroughly validated, which hampers experimental dissection of its functions and limits its development as a therapeutic target. Some non-specific inhibitors, such as Ro 318220, have been reported to impede MAPK15 activity in vitro; however, this compound also affects related kinases, and its use requires cautious interpretation (klevernic2006characterizationofthe pages 1-2). In terms of disease associations, emerging evidence from recent studies suggests that dysregulation of MAPK15 could contribute to carcinogenesis. For example, alterations in MAPK15 expression or activity have been linked to breast, colon, osteosarcoma, and gastric cancers, where its roles in cell proliferation and genomic stability are particularly impactful. Additionally, the involvement of MAPK15 in autophagy, ciliogenesis, and intracellular trafficking may have broader implications in neurodegenerative disorders and metabolic diseases. Notably, MAPK15 can function in a kinase activity-independent manner as a negative regulator of cell growth, indicating that its effects on cell proliferation might be context-dependent. Although mutations specifically affecting MAPK15 have not been extensively characterized, alterations in its regulatory domains—especially those that mediate protein degradation or subcellular localization—could potentially result in pathogenic outcomes. Current areas of active research include the identification of bona fide in vivo substrates, the elucidation of its upstream regulatory pathways, and the development of more selective chemical probes or inhibitors that can modulate its activity for therapeutic benefit (dahm2025atypicalmapksin pages 7-8, mezentsev2024acomprehensivereview pages 11-13, orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 38-41).\n\n9.

    "answer": "1. Phylogeny  \nMitogen‐activated protein kinase 9 (MAPK9), widely known as JNK2, is a member of the c‐Jun N‐terminal kinase (JNK) subgroup within the broader MAP kinase (MAPK) family. JNK2 is classified within the CMGC group of protein kinases, which includes cyclin‐dependent kinases (CDKs), glycogen synthase kinases (GSKs), and CLKs. Its evolutionary origin can be traced back to early eukaryotes, with orthologous proteins identified across a wide range of species. In vertebrates, three closely related paralogs exist—JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3—arising from whole‐genome duplication events. Among these, JNK2 is ubiquitously expressed, in contrast to the more tissue‐restricted expression of JNK3, which is primarily neuronal. JNK2 has been preserved in mammalian species, reflecting its critical regulatory function in cellular stress responses and apoptotic signaling (orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 33-38, zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 6-7).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nMAPK9 catalyzes the transfer of the γ‐phosphate group from ATP to hydroxyl groups on serine or threonine residues of substrate proteins. The reaction can be summarized as follows: ATP + [protein]–(L‐serine or L‐threonine) → ADP + [protein]–phosphoserine/threonine + H⁺. This phosphorylation event is central to the activation or modulation of downstream targets involved in transcription regulation, apoptosis, and other stress responses. In particular, MAPK9 phosphorylates key transcription factors such as c‐Jun and ATF2, thereby regulating the activity of the AP-1 complex. In addition, under conditions of oxidative or ribotoxic stress, MAPK9 phosphorylates the RNA polymerase I transcription initiation factor RRN3 leading to inhibition of rRNA synthesis (ha2019phosphorylationdynamicsof pages 13-15, sun2016themitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of MAPK9 is ATP-dependent and it requires divalent metal ions for proper enzymatic function. Typically, Mg²⁺ is essential as a cofactor because it coordinates with the phosphate groups of ATP to facilitate the phosphoryl transfer reaction. In some experimental systems, Mn²⁺ may substitute for Mg²⁺; however, Mg²⁺ is considered the physiologically relevant ion. This cofactor dependence is common among serine/threonine kinases and is critical for the precise alignment of substrates within the active site (sun2016themitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2, han2019phosphorylationdynamicsof pages 1-3).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nMAPK9 exhibits substrate specificity dictated primarily by its recognition of proline-directed serine/threonine motifs. Physiologically, its best-characterized substrates include the transcription factors c-Jun and ATF2. The kinase phosphorylates serine residues located adjacent to proline in these proteins, a hallmark of the substrate preference shared by MAP kinases. In addition to canonical AP-1 components, MAPK9 also phosphorylates other proteins such as p53, Bcl-2, and components linked to RRN3 function, thereby influencing apoptosis, cell cycle progression, and transcriptional regulation. While the core substrate motif is a serine/threonine followed by a proline, docking interactions mediated by short linear motifs (D-motifs) in substrates are also critical for modulating binding affinity and subsequent phosphorylation efficiency (orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 298-299, zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 10-13).\n\n5. Structure  \nStructurally, MAPK9 conforms to the classic MAP kinase fold that comprises a bi-lobal catalytic domain. The N-terminal lobe is β-sheet rich and contains the glycine-rich loop (G-loop), which is involved in ATP binding, whereas the C-terminal lobe is predominantly α-helical and houses the substrate binding and catalytic regions. A defining structural feature of MAPK9 is the activation loop that contains a Thr-Pro-Tyr (TPY) motif – dual phosphorylation at these threonine and tyrosine residues is necessary for activation. High-resolution crystallographic studies of related JNK isoforms provide insights into the conserved docking grooves and common docking (CD) regions that are critical for substrate and regulatory protein interactions. Furthermore, alternative splicing of MAPK9 generates isoforms (such as the p46 and p54 variants) that can differ in the length of their regulatory domains, imparting subtle variations in catalytic efficiency and substrate selectivity (ha2019phosphorylationdynamicsof pages 3-6, zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 8-10, orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 41-45).\n\n6. Regulation  \nMAPK9 is regulated through a complex interplay of phosphorylation–dephosphorylation events, scaffold-mediated interactions, and subcellular localization dynamics. The kinase is activated by dual phosphorylation on residues within its TPY motif by upstream dual-specificity kinases MAP2K4 (MKK4) and MAP2K7 (MKK7). MKK4 preferentially phosphorylates the tyrosine residue, while MKK7 catalyzes phosphorylation at the threonine residue, and together these modifications shift MAPK9 to an active conformation. Negative regulation is mediated largely by dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs), such as DUSP1 and MKP1, which dephosphorylate MAPK9, thus attenuating its signaling. Additionally, scaffold proteins such as JNK-interacting protein 1 (JIP1) and POSH coordinate the assembly of MAPK9 with its upstream kinases and substrates, ensuring both spatial and temporal specificity in signaling. Post-translational modifications beyond phosphorylation, such as ubiquitination in response to cellular stress signals, further modulate the stability and localization of MAPK9 (ha2019phosphorylationdynamicsof pages 16-18, orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 175-178, rehfeldt2020cjunnterminalkinase pages 27-29).\n\n7. Function  \nMAPK9 plays multifaceted roles in cellular processes that are central to both normal physiology and pathophysiological states. Its primary function is to modulate gene expression by phosphorylating transcription factors, thus altering cell behavior in response to extracellular stress stimuli such as pro-inflammatory cytokines, UV irradiation, and oxidative stress. Through activation of the AP-1 complex (via phosphorylation of c-Jun and ATF2), MAPK9 regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and programmed cell death (apoptosis). In stressed cells, MAPK9 also phosphorylates factors like p53 and YAP1, promoting apoptosis to prevent the propagation of damaged cells. In T lymphocytes, MAPK9, together with MAPK8 (JNK1), directs the differentiation of T-helper cells into a Th1 phenotype subsequent to T cell receptor stimulation mediated by complex assembly with CARMA1 and BCL10. Moreover, MAPK9 is implicated in cytoskeletal regulation—as in the disruption of epithelial tight junctions induced by osmotic stress—as well as in the regulation of canonical signaling pathways such as the Wnt/β-catenin cascade, where its activity leads to beta-catenin degradation. Additional roles include modulating circadian rhythm through phosphorylation of the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer and influencing neurite outgrowth in spiral ganglion neurons. These diverse functions underscore the centrality of MAPK9 in cellular stress responses, immune regulation, and developmental processes (ha2019phosphorylationdynamicsof pages 13-15, orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 298-299, yan2024theroleof pages 19-20).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nFrom a therapeutic perspective, MAPK9 is an attractive target given its central role in pathways that regulate apoptosis, inflammation, and cellular stress responses. Aberrant MAPK9 activity has been implicated in a variety of disease states, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic diseases, and autoimmune conditions. As a result, several small-molecule inhibitors, such as ATP-competitive agents like SP600125, as well as compounds disrupting MAPK9 interactions with scaffold proteins, are actively being investigated. However, the high degree of conservation in the ATP-binding sites among JNK isoforms poses a challenge for the development of isoform-selective inhibitors. Furthermore, studies using chemical probes and structure-guided drug design have provided valuable insights into the molecular determinants of inhibitor selectivity, with efforts underway to optimize lead compounds to minimize off-target effects (ansideri2018structuraloptimizationof pages 23-23, rehfeldt2020cjunnterminalkinase pages 11-13, shillingford2023mitogenactivatedproteinkinase pages 20-23). Notable among these efforts are clinical and preclinical studies exploring the use of JNK inhibitors for conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, where reduced neuroinflammation via MAPK9 inhibition may prove beneficial. In addition to small-molecule interventions, regulation through modulation of upstream kinases (MKK4/MKK7) or enhancement of DUSP activity represents alternative therapeutic strategies. Ongoing research continues to dissect the complexities of MAPK9 signaling dynamics, its splicing isoform-specific roles, and the interplay of its regulatory networks in different cell types (orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 175-178, yan2024theroleof pages 22-23, zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 31-32).\n\n9.

    "answer": "1. Phylogeny  \nMAPK10, commonly referred to as JNK3 (and by its aliases JNK3A, PRKM10, SAPK1B, and MAP kinase p49 3F12), belongs to the c‐Jun N‐terminal kinase subgroup within the larger mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) family. This family is part of the CMGC group of serine/threonine kinases, a collection of enzymes that share common catalytic features and evolutionary origins. Unlike JNK1 and JNK2—which are ubiquitously expressed in nearly every tissue—JNK3 is predominantly expressed in neuronal tissues, with additional low-level expression in cardiac smooth muscle and testes. This tissue-specific expression indicates that JNK3 has diverged to serve specialized functions in the central nervous system. Comparative sequence analyses have revealed that the kinase domain of MAPK10 is highly conserved across vertebrate species, suggesting that its evolutionary history can be traced back to a common ancestor among eukaryotes. Orthologs of MAPK10 have been identified in several mammalian species, reaffirming its fundamental role in stress-activated signaling pathways that are particularly critical for neuronal physiology (benn2020clinicallyprecedentedprotein pages 1-2, nakano2020biologicalpropertiesof pages 1-3, craige2019jnkandcardiometabolic pages 14-15).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nMAPK10 functions as a serine/threonine kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation reaction by transferring the γ-phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues present on substrate proteins. The overall reaction is typically represented as:  \n  ATP + [protein]-(Ser/Thr) → ADP + [protein]-phospho(Ser/Thr) + H^+  \nIn this process, the kinase binds ATP in a conserved catalytic cleft and orients the target substrate for efficient phosphate transfer. This phosphorylation event plays a crucial role in modulating the activity, stability, and interaction potential of the substrate proteins. Specifically, MAPK10 phosphorylates key members of the AP-1 transcription factor complex—such as JUN and ATF2—and has been shown to modify other substrates like JUND (with its phosphorylation being inhibited by MEN1), the neuronal microtubule regulator STMN2, the amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP), and the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer involved in circadian regulation (alzain2025discoveryofnovel pages 10-11, benn2020clinicallyprecedentedprotein pages 5-6, hong2025identifyingjnkregulatedphosphoproteome pages 23-25).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic function of MAPK10 is critically dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions, most notably Mg²⁺. Mg²⁺ functions by coordinating ATP within the active site, stabilizing the negative charges on phosphate groups, and decreasing the activation energy required for the phosphoryl transfer reaction. Although under certain experimental conditions Mn²⁺ can substitute for Mg²⁺, the physiological cofactor is predominantly Mg²⁺. This requirement for a divalent metal ion is a characteristic feature of serine/threonine kinases and is essential for maintaining the correct conformation of the nucleotide-binding pocket, ensuring the effective progression of the catalytic reaction (latham2022nonkinasetargetingof pages 13-14, ho2014creationandcharacterization pages 36-39).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nMAPK10 exhibits a pronounced specificity towards a subset of protein substrates by recognizing discrete amino acid motifs and engaging in docking interactions that facilitate proper substrate orientation. Physiologically, MAPK10 phosphorylates several transcription factors—including members of the AP-1 family such as JUN and ATF2—to modulate gene expression in response to stress. In addition, it phosphorylates JUND; notably, this phosphorylation is subject to negative regulation by the tumor suppressor MEN1, linking MAPK10 activity to cellular control mechanisms behind both neuronal apoptosis and tumorigenesis (benn2020clinicallyprecedentedprotein pages 5-6, hong2025identifyingjnkregulatedphosphoproteome pages 29-32). Beyond transcription factors, MAPK10 targets proteins that are critical for neuronal function. For instance, phosphorylation of STMN2 affects microtubule dynamics essential for neurite outgrowth and neuronal differentiation (benn2020clinicallyprecedentedprotein pages 23-23). Furthermore, MAPK10 has been shown to phosphorylate APP, thereby influencing pathways associated with neuronal differentiation and possibly Alzheimer’s disease pathology. An additional substrate is the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer; phosphorylation of this complex links MAPK10 activity to the regulation of circadian rhythms (musi2020jnk3astherapeutic pages 14-16). The enzyme preferentially recognizes proline-directed motifs, where a serine or threonine residue is immediately followed by a proline (S/T-P motif), although evidence also supports the recognition of non-canonical substrates through additional docking sites such as D- and F-motifs, which further refine its substrate selectivity (maikrachline2021alternativesplicingof pages 5-6, orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 191-194).\n\n5. Structure  \nThe three-dimensional structure of MAPK10 mirrors that of canonical MAP kinases and is characterized by a bilobal kinase fold. Its structure comprises an N-terminal lobe predominantly formed by β-sheets and a larger C-terminal lobe that is rich in α-helices. These two lobes converge to form a deep catalytic cleft that accommodates ATP and the target substrate. Within this kinase domain lies the activation loop (AL), which contains the highly conserved TxY motif essential for enzyme activation. Dual phosphorylation of the threonine and tyrosine residues within this motif by upstream kinases (MAP2K4/MKK4 and MAP2K7/MKK7) is required for full enzymatic activation because such modifications trigger critical conformational changes and stabilize the active conformation (ho2014creationandcharacterization pages 15-20, nakano2020biologicalpropertiesof pages 3-5, orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 295-296). Recent studies also indicate the presence of regions of intrinsic disorder located in the terminal flanking regions of the kinase domain. These disordered segments are believed to mediate interactions with scaffold proteins—such as the JNK-interacting proteins (JIPs)—and contribute to the dynamic regulation of MAPK10’s localization and substrate recognition (gehi2022intrinsicdisorderin pages 17-18, musi2020jnk3astherapeutic pages 3-5). Although high-resolution crystal structures specific to MAPK10 are less abundant compared to other MAPKs, homology models and AlphaFold predictions support the existence of a highly conserved catalytic core accompanied by surface-exposed motifs that are critical for docking of substrates and regulatory partners (ho2014creationandcharacterization pages 15-20, orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 33-38).\n\n6. Regulation  \nMAPK10 is tightly regulated by a multifaceted network of upstream kinases, scaffold proteins, and phosphatases that collectively modulate its activity in response to extracellular stress signals. Activation of MAPK10 is initiated through a classical three-tiered kinase cascade. In this cascade, environmental stressors—such as pro-inflammatory cytokines or physical stress—activate MAPKKKs, which then stimulate the activity of dual-specificity kinases MAP2K4 (MKK4) and MAP2K7 (MKK7). These MAP2Ks phosphorylate the activation loop in MAPK10 at critical threonine and tyrosine residues, a process that converts MAPK10 from an inactive to an active form (benn2020clinicallyprecedentedprotein pages 1-2, fey2015signalingpathwaymodels pages 5-7, nakano2020biologicalpropertiesof pages 3-5). Scaffold proteins, particularly the JNK-interacting proteins (JIPs), play a substantial role in fine-tuning MAPK10 activity by assembling the kinases within the signaling module and ensuring that phosphorylation events occur with high specificity and efficiency. These scaffolds co-localize the upstream activators (MKK4 and MKK7) with MAPK10 and thereby enhance the precision of the phosphorylation cascade (gehi2022intrinsicdisorderin pages 22-23, orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 238-241). Conversely, deactivation of MAPK10 is mediated by phosphatases, notably the dual-specificity MAP kinase phosphatases (MKPs), which dephosphorylate the critical residues on the activation loop, thereby providing a negative feedback mechanism that terminates the stress signal (ha2019phosphorylationdynamicsof pages 1-3, orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 41-45). An additional layer of regulatory complexity is observed in the phosphorylation of specific substrates; for instance, the phosphorylation of JUND by MAPK10 is inhibited by MEN1, indicating that protein–protein interactions can modulate substrate specificity and signaling output (benn2020clinicallyprecedentedprotein pages 5-6, orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 295-296).\n\n7. Function  \nMAPK10 exerts a central role in neuronal signaling and stress responses, largely due to its specialized expression pattern and unique substrate specificity. In neuronal cells, MAPK10 is involved in regulating proliferation, differentiation, and migration; it also plays a crucial role in programmed cell death (apoptosis). By phosphorylating transcription factors such as JUN and ATF2, MAPK10 modulates the activity of the AP-1 complex—a key driver of gene expression changes during cellular stress and apoptosis (alzain2025discoveryofnovel pages 10-11, benn2020clinicallyprecedentedprotein pages 1-2). Beyond these transcriptional effects, MAPK10 also targets substrates directly involved in the maintenance of neuronal structure and function. For example, phosphorylation of STMN2 affects microtubule dynamics that are essential for neurite outgrowth and neuronal differentiation. Moreover, through phosphorylation of the amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP), MAPK10 influences APP signaling pathways that are relevant to the development of Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders (benn2020clinicallyprecedentedprotein pages 23-23, hong2025identifyingjnkregulatedphosphoproteome pages 23-25). Additionally, the phosphorylation of the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer suggests a role for MAPK10 in regulating circadian rhythms, thereby linking cellular stress responses with the temporal control of gene expression (musi2020jnk3astherapeutic pages 14-16). These functional outcomes underline MAPK10’s capacity to integrate extracellular stress signals into a wide range of intracellular responses that are critical for neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity, and circadian regulation (ha2019phosphorylationdynamicsof pages 1-3, benn2020clinicallyprecedentedprotein pages 1-2).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nMAPK10 has emerged as a promising target for therapeutic intervention in neurodegenerative diseases and certain cancers, owing to its pivotal role in mediating neuronal apoptosis and stress responses. Its capacity to phosphorylate APP, for example, links MAPK10 activity to Alzheimer’s disease pathology, while its regulation of transcription factors involved in apoptosis underscores its potential as a target in conditions characterized by aberrant neuronal death (musi2020jnk3astherapeutic pages 1-3, rehfeldt2020cjunnterminalkinase pages 9-11). Moreover, efforts to develop both ATP-competitive and non-ATP competitive inhibitors that selectively target the JNK3 isoform are ongoing, with some compounds already demonstrating preferential inhibition in preclinical studies (latham2022nonkinasetargetingof pages 5-6, jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 12-14). Alternative splicing of MAPK10 results in multiple isoforms that may exhibit distinct regulatory properties and tissue-specific functions, adding further complexity to its biological roles and offering additional avenues for targeted drug discovery (maikrachline2021alternativesplicingof pages 5-6, musi2020jnk3astherapeutic pages 3-5). Research continues to explore the role of intrinsically disordered regions in mediating interactions with scaffold proteins such as the JIP family, which are essential for the assembly of signaling complexes that regulate MAPK10 activity and substrate specificity (gehi2022intrinsicdisorderin pages 17-18, orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 238-241). Collectively, these aspects not only underscore the importance of MAPK10 in neuronal signaling pathways but also highlight its potential as a biomarker of neuronal stress responses and as a target for novel neuroprotective therapies.\n\n9.

    "answer": "## 1. Phylogeny  \nRibosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1) belongs to the AGC family of serine/threonine protein kinases, an evolutionarily conserved group that traces its origins back to the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) along with other core regulators of the TOR signaling pathway such as PDK1, AKT/protein kinase B, and p90 ribosomal S6 kinases (RSKs) (malanchuk2024investigatingtheregulation pages 1-2, wilson2018newperspectivesopportunities pages 1-5). This kinase is part of the highly conserved TOR pathway gene set, indicating that RPS6KB1 and its orthologs are present in all mammalian species and likely across a broad range of eukaryotes. Evolutionary studies suggest that gene duplication events in early animals and fungi produced distinct yet functionally interrelated kinases such as S6K and RSK, both regulated by the upstream kinase PDK1 and modulated by mTORC1 signaling (malanchuk2024investigatingtheregulation pages 1-2, cronin2021theroleof pages 1-2).\n\n## 2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nRPS6KB1 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to specific serine or threonine residues on its substrates. The reaction can be summarized as:  \n  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺  \nThis phosphorylation reaction is central to downstream signaling in response to growth factors and nutrients, altering the activity, stability, or subcellular localization of target proteins involved in mRNA translation, cell growth, and survival (malanchuk2024investigatingtheregulation pages 1-2, wilson2018newperspectivesopportunities pages 5-9).\n\n## 3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of RPS6KB1 is dependent on the presence of Mg²⁺ ions, which are essential for coordinating the binding of ATP in the kinase active site and facilitating the transfer of the phosphate group to target proteins. The requirement for Mg²⁺ is typical for serine/threonine kinases and is critical for effective enzymatic function (wilson2018newperspectivesopportunities pages 1-5).\n\n## 4. Substrate Specificity  \nRPS6KB1 displays substrate selectivity that is determined both by the amino acid sequence surrounding the phosphorylation site and by the three-dimensional conformation of the substrate proteins. Physiologically, RPS6KB1 phosphorylates a variety of substrates that are key regulators of protein synthesis and cell survival. Notable substrates include:  \n• Ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6), which is integral to the 40S ribosomal subunit and whose phosphorylation stimulates mRNA translation (malanchuk2024investigatingtheregulation pages 1-2, malanchuk2024investigatingtheregulation pages 2-3).  \n• Eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (EIF4B), a component of the cap-binding complex that is important for the initiation of translation (malanchuk2024investigatingtheregulation pages 15-16).  \n• Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (EEF2K), whose phosphorylation leads to activation of EEF2 and promotes translation elongation in response to IGF1 (malanchuk2024investigatingtheregulation pages 1-2).  \n• The pro-apoptotic protein BAD, whose inhibitory phosphorylation by RPS6KB1 contributes to cell survival by suppressing apoptotic signals (malanchuk2024investigatingtheregulation pages 1-2).  \nFurthermore, consensus substrate motifs for S6K have been described with a preference for an RxRxxp[ST] motif, in which the presence of arginine residues upstream of the phosphorylated serine or threonine is critical for substrate recognition (malanchuk2024investigatingtheregulation pages 1-2, poomakkoth2016p90ribosomals6 pages 2-4).\n\n## 5. Structure  \nRPS6KB1 is characterized by a modular organization typical of AGC kinases. It possesses a conserved central kinase domain that is divided into an N-terminal lobe responsible primarily for ATP binding and a larger C-terminal lobe that mediates substrate recognition and catalytic activity. Key structural features include:  \n• A regulatory TOS (TOR signaling) motif near the N-terminus, which is necessary for binding to the RAPTOR component of mTORC1 and is crucial for mTOR-dependent phosphorylation and activation (malanchuk2024investigatingtheregulation pages 2-3).  \n• An activation loop containing critical residues such as Thr229, which is phosphorylated by PDK1, and adjacent regions including Cys217 that have been identified as sites for novel post-translational modifications like CoAlation (malanchuk2024investigatingtheregulation pages 3-6, malanchuk2024investigatingtheregulation pages 9-11).  \n• A hydrophobic motif, notably incorporating Thr389 (in S6K1) that is phosphorylated by mTORC1, which plays a key role in relieving autoinhibition and promoting full kinase activation (malanchuk2024investigatingtheregulation pages 6-9).  \nStructural studies using molecular docking and dynamics simulations have provided insights into the binding of Coenzyme A (CoA) in the nucleotide-binding pocket, revealing stable interactions that involve hydrogen bonds with residues in the kinase hinge region (malanchuk2024investigatingtheregulation pages 9-11, malanchuk2024investigatingtheregulation pages 16-18).  \nAdditionally, the overall 3D conformation of RPS6KB1, as observed in crystal structures and predicted by AlphaFold models, shows typical AGC kinase features with regulatory regions that are intrinsically disordered, allowing flexibility for interacting with various substrates and regulatory proteins (wilson2018newperspectivesopportunities pages 1-5).\n\n## 6. Regulation  \nThe activity of RPS6KB1 is tightly regulated through both activating and inhibitory post-translational modifications (PTMs) to ensure precise control of cell growth and metabolism. Major regulatory mechanisms include:  \n• Phosphorylation: Activation of RPS6KB1 requires sequential phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif (Thr389 in S6K1), which is critical for full activation and dissociation from complexes such as the EIF3 translation initiation complex under mitogenic stimulation (malanchuk2024investigatingtheregulation pages 1-2, malanchuk2024investigatingtheregulation pages 16-18). Subsequently, the kinase is phosphorylated on the activation loop (Thr229) by PDK1, a modification that is essential for achieving maximal catalytic activity (malanchuk2024investigatingtheregulation pages 6-9).  \n• CoAlation: Under oxidative stress conditions, a novel regulatory PTM termed “CoAlation” occurs at Cys217 in the activation loop. This covalent modification by coenzyme A results in approximately 40% inhibition of kinase activity by interfering with the phosphorylation status of Thr229 and potentially protecting the cysteine from irreversible oxidation (malanchuk2024investigatingtheregulation pages 3-6, malanchuk2024investigatingtheregulation pages 9-11).  \n• Other PTMs: Additional modifications such as acetylation, ubiquitination, and O-GlcNAcylation have been reported to modulate RPS6KB1 activity. For instance, acetylation at the C-terminus can inhibit mTOR-dependent phosphorylation, while ubiquitination affects protein turnover independently of phosphorylation status (malanchuk2024investigatingtheregulation pages 15-16, wilson2018newperspectivesopportunities pages 34-39).  \nThese regulatory mechanisms collectively ensure that RPS6KB1 integrates nutrient signals and mitogenic cues to appropriately regulate downstream processes, such as mRNA translation and cell survival (malanchuk2024investigatingtheregulation pages 1-2, cronin2021theroleof pages 10-11).\n\n## 7. Function  \nRPS6KB1 functions as a central effector of mTOR signaling in response to growth factors and nutrient availability. Its biological roles are multifaceted and include:  \n• Regulation of Protein Synthesis: By phosphorylating substrates such as ribosomal protein S6, EIF4B, and EEF2K, RPS6KB1 enhances both the initiation and elongation phases of protein synthesis. This leads to increased ribosome biogenesis and overall mRNA translation, thus supporting cell growth and proliferation (malanchuk2024investigatingtheregulation pages 1-2, malanchuk2024investigatingtheregulation pages 15-16).  \n• Cell Cycle Progression and Growth: Phosphorylation events mediated by RPS6KB1 promote cell cycle progression and cell growth by activating pathways that lead to increased mRNA translation and by modulating the activity of proteins involved in cell cycle checkpoints (malanchuk2024investigatingtheregulation pages 1-2, poomakkoth2016p90ribosomals6 pages 2-4).  \n• Feedback Regulation of mTOR Complexes: RPS6KB1 participates in negative feedback loops that regulate both mTORC1 and mTORC2. It phosphorylates components such as MAPKAP1/SIN1, MTOR, RICTOR, and DEPTOR, which in turn modulate the activity of AKT1 and other signaling pathways involved in cell survival and metabolism (malanchuk2024investigatingtheregulation pages 1-2, malanchuk2024investigatingtheregulation pages 9-11).  \n• Cell Survival and Apoptosis: In addition to promoting protein synthesis, RPS6KB1 enhances cell survival by phosphorylating the pro-apoptotic protein BAD, thereby suppressing its apoptotic function. Moreover, the kinase’s influence on mitochondrial proteins such as URI1 contributes to the regulation of apoptosis via feedback mechanisms involving phosphatases like PPP1CC (malanchuk2024investigatingtheregulation pages 1-2, malanchuk2024investigatingtheregulation pages 9-11).  \n• Metabolic Regulation: RPS6KB1 is implicated in metabolic reprogramming by phosphorylating IRS1, which leads to its degradation and contributes to insulin resistance, and by regulating enzymes involved in pyrimidine biosynthesis such as CAD (malanchuk2024investigatingtheregulation pages 1-2, malanchuk2024investigatingtheregulation pages 15-16).  \n• Translation Initiation Complex Dynamics: Under nutrient deprivation, the inactive form of RPS6KB1 associates with the EIF3 initiation complex; however, upon mitogenic stimulation and phosphorylation by mTORC1, it dissociates from this complex to activate translation (malanchuk2024investigatingtheregulation pages 1-2).  \nIn summary, RPS6KB1 integrates signals from nutrient availability and growth factor stimulation into diverse cellular outcomes that include increased protein synthesis, cell growth, metabolic adjustment, and inhibition of apoptosis, making it a pivotal regulator of cell proliferation and survival (malanchuk2024investigatingtheregulation pages 1-2, cronin2021theroleof pages 10-11).\n\n## 8. Other Comments  \nSeveral small molecule inhibitors have been developed to target RPS6KB1, motivated by its central role in cell growth, metabolism, and oncogenic signaling. For example, PF-4708671 is a selective inhibitor that is more potent against S6K1 relative to other closely related kinases such as RSK isoforms, while compounds like LY2584702 have progressed to clinical trials (bain2007theselectivityof pages 9-10, wilson2018newperspectivesopportunities pages 34-39). In addition to its role in normal cellular physiology, dysregulation of RPS6KB1 has been implicated in various disease contexts, including several cancers (where aberrant mTOR signaling drives tumor progression), obesity, and insulin resistance (malanchuk2024investigatingtheregulation pages 1-2, cronin2021theroleof pages 10-11). The kinase’s involvement in feedback loops that modulate both mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling further underscores its potential as a therapeutic target, with ongoing research directed toward understanding its regulatory mechanisms—especially redox regulation via CoAlation—and developing more selective inhibitors (malanchuk2024investigatingtheregulation pages 9-11, bain2007theselectivityof pages 9-10). Furthermore, additional layers of control, such as acetylation and ubiquitination observed in RPS6KB1 regulation, suggest that combinatorial targeting strategies may be necessary to fully modulate its activity in disease settings. Notable mutations or alterations in expression levels of RPS6KB1 have been observed in cellular models of cancer, emphasizing the need for integrated phospho-proteomic and genomic analyses to unravel its complex role in oncogenesis (wilson2018newperspectivesopportunities pages 34-39, cronin2021theroleof pages 10-11).\n\n## 9.

    "answer": "1. Phylogeny  \nRibosomal protein S6 kinase beta-2 (RPS6KB2), also known as S6K2 or STK14B, is a member of the AGC kinase family. This kinase is evolutionarily ancient, traceable to the common ancestor of eukaryotes, and belongs to a core set of TOR pathway–related kinases that include PDK1, AKT, p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK, all of which have their origins in or before the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) (khalil2024s6k2infocus pages 1-3, sridharan2020distinctrolesof pages 11-13). Although S6K1 (encoded by RPS6KB1) and S6K2 are highly homologous in their kinase domains (with approximately 83–84% identity), they have diverged in their N- and C-terminal regions, leading to distinct functional and regulatory properties. Orthologs of S6K2 are conserved across mammalian species, and evidence from plant systems further demonstrates that ribosomal S6 kinases form one of the most conserved modules in eukaryotic signaling, with plant S6 kinases sharing key regulatory motifs despite species‐specific roles (lapenas2023ofthevulnerability pages 13-18, tavares2015thes6kprotein pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nRPS6KB2 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to specific serine/threonine residues on substrate proteins. The canonical reaction can be summarized as:  \n ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺.  \nThe principal physiological substrate of S6K2 is ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6), a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit. Phosphorylation of rpS6 plays a key role in the regulation of mRNA translation, particularly enhancing the translation of 5′-TOP mRNAs that encode components of the translational machinery. Notably, S6K2 also phosphorylates additional substrates such as histone H3 at threonine 45, indicating potential roles in chromatin regulation and nuclear signaling (khalil2024s6k2infocus pages 1-3, myronova2016theroleof pages 46-51). The reaction mechanism involves an ordered bi–bi process wherein substrate binding is accompanied by conformational changes in the kinase that facilitate phosphotransfer, a mechanism typical for serine/threonine kinases in the AGC family (khalil2024s6k2infocus pages 9-11).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of RPS6KB2 is dependent on common kinase cofactors. As with many serine/threonine kinases, S6K2 requires ATP as the phosphate donor. Divalent metal ions, particularly Mg²⁺, are essential for effective ATP binding and stabilization of the transition state during catalysis. Although specific experimental details on additional cofactors for S6K2 are not exhaustively documented in the available excerpts, it is standard for kinases of the AGC family to also use Mg²⁺, and sometimes Mn²⁺, to achieve proper phosphotransfer (khalil2024s6k2infocus pages 3-4, lapenas2023ofthevulnerability pages 173-176).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nS6K2 exhibits substrate specificity that is both shared with and distinct from its paralog S6K1. Its best‐characterized substrate is ribosomal protein S6, where phosphorylation typically occurs on a cluster of serine residues in the carboxy-terminal region. The consensus motif recognized by S6 kinases is generally of the form RxRxxp[ST], where “p[ST]” indicates a phosphorylated serine or threonine residue. Beyond rpS6, S6K2 phosphorylates additional substrates such as histone H3 at threonine 45, which may influence chromatin dynamics and gene expression (khalil2024s6k2infocus pages 27-28, tavares2015thes6kprotein pages 7-8). In certain cellular contexts, S6K2 has also been implicated in the regulation of factors involved in mRNA processing and miRNA biogenesis, such as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1) and Transactivation Response RNA-binding Protein (TRBP) (khalil2024s6k2infocus pages 6-7, myronova2016theroleof pages 46-51). This broader substrate recognition allows S6K2 to induce multiple downstream effects beyond translation enhancement.\n\n5. Structure  \nStructurally, RPS6KB2 is organized around a central catalytic kinase domain that is highly conserved among AGC kinases, flanked by regulatory regions that confer specificity and control. The kinase domain is responsible for ATP binding and catalysis, with well-defined motifs including the activation loop, which is instrumental for substrate recognition and catalytic efficiency, and the DFG motif that coordinates Mg²⁺ for ATP binding (khalil2024s6k2infocus pages 1-3, lapenas2023ofthevulnerability pages 173-176).  \nDistinctively, S6K2 differs from S6K1 in its C-terminal region: while S6K1 harbors a PDZ-binding domain, S6K2 contains a proline-rich region immediately followed by a nuclear localization sequence (NLS). This feature supports the predominant nuclear localization observed for S6K2, suggesting specialized roles in nuclear signaling and gene regulatory mechanisms. Additionally, the N-terminal region of S6K2 contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif (often represented by an FDIDL sequence in the first 5–9 residues) that facilitates its recruitment to mTORC1 via interaction with RAPTOR, thereby positioning it for activation by mTOR-mediated phosphorylation (khalil2024s6k2infocus pages 3-4, tavares2015thes6kprotein pages 8-9). Crystal structural data for human S6 kinases have not been as exhaustively detailed as for some other AGC kinases; however, computational and homology modeling studies (including molecular dynamics and docking simulations) have provided insights into the conformational flexibility of S6K2 and have identified potential unique binding pockets that may be exploited for selective inhibitor development (khalil2024s6k2infocus pages 24-25, cronin2023amechanisticapproach pages 27-34).\n\n6. Regulation  \nRegulation of S6K2 activity is complex and involves multiple layers of control that ensure a tight coupling to cellular nutrient status and mitogenic signals. The full activation of RPS6KB2 requires a sequential phosphorylation cascade: initially, upstream signals such as those mediated by the MEK/ERK pathway lead to priming phosphorylation events that relieve autoinhibition (khalil2024s6k2infocus pages 7-9, myronova2016theroleof pages 30-36).  \nmTORC1, acting as a nutrient and growth factor sensor, phosphorylates S6K2 at a conserved hydrophobic motif (T388 in S6K2) to relieve the autoinhibitory conformation imposed by its regulatory regions (khalil2024s6k2infocus pages 9-11, sridharan2020distinctrolesof pages 3-5). Following this, PDK1 phosphorylates the activation loop (T228 in S6K2), which is essential for full catalytic activity (khalil2024s6k2infocus pages 9-11).  \nIn addition, S6K2 receives isoform-specific modifications. For example, protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylates S6K2 at Ser486, a modification that can interfere with nuclear localization signals and modulate subcellular distribution, ensuring that a portion of the enzyme remains sequestered in the cytoplasm upon specific stimuli (khalil2024s6k2infocus pages 9-11). Furthermore, S6K2 undergoes post-translational modifications such as arginine methylation, mediated by PRMT enzymes, which influence its nuclear presence and pro-survival activity (khalil2024s6k2infocus pages 6-7). Other regulatory mechanisms include ubiquitination and acetylation that affect protein stability and interactions, though the precise enzymes responsible for these modifications have not been fully elucidated (khalil2024s6k2infocus pages 24-25, myronova2016theroleof pages 36-41). Regulation by phosphatases such as PP2A has also been implicated in modulating S6K2 dephosphorylation and thus its overall signaling output (khalil2024s6k2infocus pages 6-7).\n\n7. Function  \nRPS6KB2 functions as a critical effector in signaling pathways that integrate extracellular growth factors and nutrient availability with intracellular anabolic processes. Acting downstream of mTORC1, S6K2 phosphorylates ribosomal protein S6, thereby enhancing the translation of specific mRNAs, particularly those possessing 5′-terminal oligopyrimidine (5′-TOP) motifs that encode components of the protein synthesis machinery (khalil2024s6k2infocus pages 1-3, yi2021ribosomalproteins6 pages 4-6). This phosphorylation event is essential for regulating global protein synthesis rates, cell size, and proliferative capacity.  \nBeyond its canonical role in translational control, S6K2 has been implicated in the regulation of other cellular processes. Notably, S6K2 phosphorylates histone H3 at threonine 45, suggesting a role in modulating chromatin dynamics and gene expression, which might influence cellular differentiation and proliferation outcomes (khalil2024s6k2infocus pages 27-28, myronova2016theroleof pages 41-46). In addition, the kinase interacts with RNA-binding proteins such as hnRNPA1 and TRBP, affecting the biogenesis and nuclear export of mRNA and microRNAs; these interactions have been linked to enhanced cell survival and chemoresistance by promoting the translation of anti-apoptotic proteins like Bcl-XL and XIAP (khalil2024s6k2infocus pages 6-7, myronova2016theroleof pages 46-51).  \nFunctional studies demonstrate that S6K2 is involved in cell cycle progression and proliferation, consistently linking its overexpression or dysregulated activity with oncogenic phenotypes in cancers such as breast, colorectal, and lung cancers. Its activity modulates not only the control of protein synthesis but also provides feedback into the mTOR signaling cascade, contributing to the fine tuning of cellular metabolism and growth (sridharan2020distinctrolesof pages 3-5, khalil2024s6k2infocus pages 3-4). In normal physiology, S6K2 is expressed in multiple tissues, and its proper regulation is necessary for maintaining cellular homeostasis and adapting to environmental cues, including nutrient and growth factor availability (myronova2016theroleof pages 25-30).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nAlthough research on S6K2 has historically lagged behind that of S6K1, emerging evidence increasingly supports distinct roles for RPS6KB2 in cancer biology and other pathological conditions. Genetic association studies, as reflected by data from Open Targets, have implicated RPS6KB2 in variations of hematological parameters and lipid metabolism, indicating potential broader physiological roles beyond translational control. Despite the development of several S6 kinase inhibitors, most available inhibitors such as PF-4708671 and LY2584702 were primarily characterized for their effects on S6K1, and selective inhibition of S6K2 remains an active area of investigation (khalil2024s6k2infocus pages 24-25, sridharan2020distinctrolesof pages 1-3). Current research efforts are focused on better resolving the isoform-specific functions of S6K2, understanding its unique substrate interactions, and elucidating the consequences of its post-translational modifications—which include phosphorylation, arginine methylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation—to design highly selective inhibitors for potential therapeutic applications in cancer and metabolic disorders (khalil2024s6k2infocus pages 6-7, myronova2016theroleof pages 36-41). The atypical nuclear localization of S6K2, which contrasts with the more cytoplasmic distribution of S6K1, further reinforces the idea that the two kinases have non-redundant contributions to cell proliferation and survival. Future studies that integrate structural biology with in vivo functional assays are expected to uncover new opportunities for targeting S6K2 in disease contexts.\n\n9.

    "answer": "1. Phylogeny  \nmTOR is an evolutionarily ancient serine/threonine kinase that belongs to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase (PIKK) family, a group of atypical kinases highly conserved among eukaryotes. Its orthologous relationships span from lower eukaryotes such as yeasts and fungi to higher mammals including Homo sapiens. Within the kinome, mTOR is part of a core set of nutrient sensing and growth regulatory proteins that emerged in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA), alongside other key components such as Rheb, TSC1/2, LST8, RAPTOR, RICTOR, and SIN1. Comparative genomic analyses, as described in multiple fungal studies, reveal the presence of a single TOR gene in most eukaryotic organisms; however, some fungi possess duplicate TOR genes potentially resulting from lineage‐specific gene duplications (song2024thetorsignalling pages 1-2, tatebe2017evolutionaryconservationof pages 1-4). Phylogenetic reconstruction based on conserved domains—HEAT repeats at the N-terminus, FAT, FRB, kinase, and FATC domains at the C-terminus—confirms that mTOR orthologs cluster together according to their evolutionary relationships, and these conserved motifs underline its fundamental role in nutrient, energy, and growth factor signaling (tatebe2017evolutionaryconservationof pages 4-6). The kinase’s membership in the PIKK family, sharing key catalytic and regulatory features with DNA-PKcs, ATM, and ATR, further supports its deep evolutionary conservation in the eukaryotic lineage (song2024thetorsignalling pages 2-5, OpenTargets Search: -MTOR).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nmTOR catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to specific serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins. The general reaction is: ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(phospho-L-serine/threonine) + H⁺. As a serine/threonine kinase, mTOR phosphorylates at least 800 substrates directly or indirectly, thereby modulating various aspects of cell growth, metabolism, and survival (Information section). The reaction mechanism follows that of canonical protein kinases where binding of ATP and the substrate in the active site is coordinated by structural motifs in the kinase domain—including the glycine-rich loop and conserved catalytic residues—thus facilitating phosphoryl transfer (coldron2022biochemicalanalysisof pages 18-20).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic function of mTOR, as with many kinases, requires divalent metal ions; in most cases, magnesium ions (Mg²⁺) are essential. Mg²⁺ coordinates with the phosphate groups of ATP, thereby stabilizing the transition state during the phosphoryl transfer process. While the detailed studies on cofactor dependency specific to mTOR are not exhaustively detailed in the provided excerpts, the general consensus for serine/threonine kinases within the PIKK family implies a Mg²⁺ requirement (coldron2022biochemicalanalysisof pages 18-20).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nmTOR exerts its influence by phosphorylating a wide range of substrates involved in anabolic metabolism, translation regulation, and autophagy. Physiologically relevant substrates include EIF4EBP1 (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1) and the ribosomal protein S6 kinases (RPS6KB1 and RPS6KB2). These phosphorylation events result in the activation of translation by relieving inhibition of eiF4E and by modulating protein synthesis machinery (Information section). Although an explicit consensus sequence for mTOR phosphorylation is not as well defined as for some smaller kinases, its substrate recognition appears to be influenced by the proximity of docking motifs or binding domains such as the TOS motif on targets like S6K, which facilitates interaction with mTORC1 via RAPTOR (song2024thetorsignalling pages 2-5, tatebe2017evolutionaryconservationof pages 6-8). In addition, mTOR modifies regulators of autophagy such as ULK1, phosphorylating it at sites involved in the negative regulation of autophagy under nutrient-rich conditions (Information section). This broad substrate profile underscores mTOR’s role as a master regulator with a versatile substrate-selective mechanism dependent on protein–protein interaction interfaces (song2024thetorsignalling pages 18-19).\n\n5. Structure  \nmTOR is a large multidomain protein with a predicted molecular weight of approximately 280 kDa. Its structure is organized into several distinct domains that contribute to both catalytic and regulatory functions. Starting at the N-terminus, a series of HEAT repeats—named for their occurrence in huntingtin, elongation factor 3, PP2A, and TOR1—provide a platform for protein–protein interactions and serve as scaffolding elements necessary for complex assembly (song2024thetorsignalling pages 2-5, tatebe2017evolutionaryconservationof pages 4-6). Following the HEAT repeats is the FAT domain (named for FRAP, ATM, TRRAP), which further contributes to the structural integrity and proper folding of the kinase. The FRB (FKBP12-rapamycin binding) domain is located immediately after the FAT domain; this domain is key to the binding of the FKBP12-rapamycin complex, thereby mediating the potent inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin (song2024thetorsignalling pages 1-2, coldron2022biochemicalanalysisof pages 26-28). The central catalytic kinase domain belongs to the PIKK family and contains conserved motifs such as the glycine-rich loop, the conserved lysine in the β3 strand, and the DFG motif, which are essential for ATP binding, catalysis, and substrate positioning (coldron2022biochemicalanalysisof pages 20-26, tatebe2017evolutionaryconservationof pages 6-8). At the C-terminus, the FATC domain, a short but highly conserved motif, plays a critical role in regulating the catalytic activity and stability of the protein (song2024thetorsignalling pages 2-5, tatebe2017evolutionaryconservationof pages 8-11). High-resolution structural data from cryo-electron microscopy, particularly in mammalian mTORC1 complexes, have provided insights into the assembly and spatial organization of these domains, revealing that the HEAT repeats form solenoidal structures that interact symmetrically in the mTOR homodimer (tatebe2017evolutionaryconservationof pages 13-15, song2024thetorsignalling pages 2-5).\n\n6. Regulation  \nmTOR's activity is tightly regulated in response to a multitude of intracellular and extracellular signals. One of the best characterized regulatory mechanisms is the binding of the immunosuppressant rapamycin in complex with the FKBP12 protein. This ternary complex specifically interacts with the FRB domain to inhibit mTORC1 activity without affecting mTORC2 under most conditions (song2024thetorsignalling pages 1-2, song2024thetorsignalling pages 5-6). Upstream regulators include the small GTPase Rheb, which, when in its GTP-bound state, activates mTORC1, and the TSC1/2 complex, which acts as a GTPase-activating protein to inhibit Rheb and thus mTORC1 (Information section, tatebe2017evolutionaryconservationof pages 16-17). mTOR activity is further controlled by nutrient signals, such as the availability of amino acids, which recruit mTORC1 to the lysosome via interactions involving the Rag GTPases and the Ragulator complex (song2024thetorsignalling pages 18-19, gu2022biochemicalandphysiological pages 76-80). In addition to classical phosphorylation, mTOR is subject to post-translational modifications that modulate its function. For instance, recent studies in immune and infectious contexts have highlighted the role of ISGylation at lysine 2066 within the FRB domain, which may affect autophagy regulation during infection (zhang2019theinvivo pages 7-8, zhang2019theinvivo pages 9-10). Moreover, feedback loops exist wherein mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of proteins such as GRB10 results in the attenuation of upstream growth factor signaling, thus providing self-regulatory control over the pathway (Information section, song2024thetorsignalling pages 1-2). These complex layers of regulation—encompassing phosphorylation, small GTPase interactions, lysosomal recruitment, and covalent modifications—ensure that mTOR activity is finely tuned to the metabolic and environmental status of the cell (saksena2020proteinphosphatasesat pages 16-18, gu2022biochemicalandphysiological pages 171-173).\n\n7. Function  \nmTOR is centrally involved in the regulation of cellular growth, metabolism, and survival. As a core component of two structurally and functionally distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, mTOR coordinates diverse cellular processes. mTORC1 governs anabolic metabolism by promoting protein, lipid, and nucleotide synthesis, principally through the phosphorylation of targets such as EIF4EBP1, which releases its inhibition on the translation initiation factor eiF4E, and by activating S6K1 and S6K2, which in turn phosphorylate ribosomal proteins and other factors necessary for protein synthesis (Information section, song2024thetorsignalling pages 1-2). Furthermore, mTORC1 stimulates ribosomal biogenesis by activating RNA polymerase III-dependent transcription through the phosphorylation and inhibition of the MAF1 repressor (Information section). mTORC1 also plays a critical role in suppressing catabolic processes; for example, under nutrient-rich conditions, mTORC1 phosphorylates ULK1 to inhibit autophagy, thereby maintaining cellular energy homeostasis (Information section, song2024thetorsignalling pages 2-5). In parallel, mTORC2, which is generally insensitive to nutrient fluctuations, is primarily activated by growth factors. mTORC2 phosphorylates a range of AGC family kinases—most notably AKT (at residues such as Ser-473, Thr-450, and other context-dependent sites), various PKC isoforms, and SGK1—contributing to the regulation of cell proliferation, actin cytoskeletal organization, and metabolic homeostasis (Information section, song2024thetorsignalling pages 17-18, tatebe2017evolutionaryconservationof pages 16-17). In addition to its well-established roles in nutrient sensing and protein synthesis, mTOR impacts additional processes including lipid biosynthesis, mitochondrial biogenesis, and even regulatory feedback mechanisms on insulin signaling through modifications of substrates such as GRB10 (Information section, laskovs2024investigatingthemetabolic pages 25-28). Because of its central involvement in these pathways, dysregulation of mTOR has been implicated in numerous pathological conditions including cancers, metabolic disorders, neurodegeneration, and immune dysfunction (OpenTargets Search: -MTOR, attwood2021trendsinkinase pages 23-25).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nBeyond its essential cellular functions, mTOR has attracted significant attention as a therapeutic target. Inhibitors such as rapamycin and its analogs (rapalogs) effectively suppress mTORC1 activity by binding to its FRB domain in complex with FKBP12, and new-generation ATP-competitive inhibitors have been developed to target both mTORC1 and mTORC2 simultaneously (song2024thetorsignalling pages 1-2, coldron2022biochemicalanalysisof pages 26-28). Clinically, mTOR inhibitors are currently used to treat diseases such as certain cancers, lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), and, potentially, neurological disorders. mTOR’s extensive substrate network—with over 800 proteins being ultimately affected—further underscores its influence on cell metabolism and survival, rendering it a nexus within a vast regulatory network (Information section, OpenTargets Search: -MTOR). Notable mutations in upstream regulators, such as loss-of-function mutations in TSC1/TSC2 that lead to mTOR hyperactivation, have been linked to overgrowth syndromes and various neoplasias (Information section). In addition, emerging evidence on noncanonical post-translational modifications such as ISGylation suggests additional layers of regulatory control that may be exploited for therapeutic benefit (zhang2019theinvivo pages 7-8). Ongoing research focuses on understanding the detailed molecular mechanisms that govern mTOR’s interactions with its substrates and regulators, as well as on the development of more selective inhibitors that might offer improved efficacy with fewer side effects (marchi2024developmentofmodels pages 33-38, harachi2021proteinacetylationat pages 9-10). Due to its central role in integrating nutrient, energy, and growth factor signals, mTOR remains one of the most heavily studied kinases in biomedical research, and it is likely that further layers of regulation and additional substrates will be identified in the coming years (song2024thetorsignalling pages 18-19, gu2022biochemicalandphysiological pages 167-171).\n\n9.

    "answer": "1. Phylogeny  \nCyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) is a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase family that functions as a serine/threonine-protein kinase essential for cell cycle regulation. Phylogenetically, CDK2 is grouped within the CMGC branch of the kinome and is evolutionarily related to other CDKs such as CDK1 and CDK4/6, which share the conserved kinase fold and regulatory mechanisms. CDK2 can be traced back to the common ancestral eukaryotic cell cycle machinery, indicating that it is part of an evolutionarily ancient and conserved set of kinases responsible for cell cycle progression. Orthologs of CDK2 exist in diverse eukaryotic species, including yeast, plants, and mammals, underscoring its fundamental role in the regulation of G1/S transition and subsequent phases of cell division (OpenTargets Search: -CDK2, wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 2-3).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK2 catalyzes the transfer of the γ-phosphate from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues on its target proteins. In this phosphorylation reaction, ATP is converted to ADP while the substrate protein is modified to yield a phosphorylated serine/threonine residue along with the release of a proton. This reaction is central to the regulation of the cell cycle, as it enables the modification of key regulators such as the retinoblastoma protein (RB1), BRCA2, and various transcription factors, thus altering their activity, interactions, or subcellular localization. In addition to its canonical substrates, CDK2 phosphorylates proteins involved in centrosome duplication, DNA repair, and transcriptional regulation, thereby integrating signals from cell cycle checkpoints with broader cellular functions (rohm2021functionstructureand pages 1-4, somarelli2020aprecisionmedicine pages 19-20).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nActivation of CDK2 requires the binding of ATP as the phosphate donor and magnesium ions (Mg²⁺) as essential cofactors to stabilize the ATP substrate during catalysis. The ATP binding occurs within a conserved cleft formed by the N-terminal lobe, which includes a glycine-rich loop (commonly described as the P-loop), and the C-terminal lobe of the kinase domain. Magnesium ions mediate the correct positioning of ATP phosphates and contribute to the proper orientation of catalytic residues, ensuring efficient phosphoryl transfer. No additional cofactors are known to be strictly required for the catalytic activity of CDK2, although the association with cyclins (such as cyclin E and cyclin A) is crucial for inducing the proper conformational rearrangements that maximize its enzymatic activity (wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 2-3).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCDK2 exhibits substrate specificity that is determined largely by its interaction with cyclin partners, which facilitate the recognition of key amino acid motifs on target proteins. Physiologically, CDK2 phosphorylates substrates implicated in cell cycle progression including the retinoblastoma protein (RB1), BRCA2, NPAT, and transcriptional regulators such as MYC and p53. The kinase targets a serine/threonine residue that often lies within a specific peptide sequence context; although a strict consensus motif is not universally defined, many substrates conform to a motif that requires a proline residue immediately following the phosphorylated serine/threonine, sometimes in combination with basic residues upstream. Complex formation with cyclin E during the early stages of DNA synthesis or with cyclin A during later S phase transitions facilitates substrate recruitment; for example, cyclin-bound CDK2 phosphorylates NPAT to trigger histone gene transcription necessary for DNA replication (łukasik2021cyclindependentkinases(cdk) pages 11-12, somarelli2020aprecisionmedicine pages 12-14). Furthermore, docking motifs present in substrates can enhance binding and promote efficient phosphorylation by CDK2, ensuring that regulatory events such as centrosome duplication and DNA damage checkpoint activation are executed with high fidelity (faustova2021anewlinear pages 16-16).\n\n5. Structure  \nCDK2 comprises a central conserved kinase domain that is organized into two lobes – a smaller N-terminal lobe largely composed of β-strands that contains the glycine-rich loop, and a larger C-terminal lobe primarily made up of α-helices. The active site, which lies in the cleft between these lobes, houses the ATP-binding pocket and the catalytic machinery, including key residues such as a lysine (commonly K33) that interacts with the phosphates of ATP and a catalytic aspartate residue that participates in phosphoryl transfer. The activation loop (A-loop) of CDK2 contains a critical threonine residue (T160) whose phosphorylation is essential for full kinase activation; phosphorylation leads to a reorientation of the activation loop that allows substrate access and stabilizes the active conformation (wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 4-5, majumdar2021allosterygovernscdk2 pages 3-4). In its inactive state, monomeric CDK2 adopts an “A-loop-in/αC-out” conformation, but binding to cyclin (such as cyclin E or cyclin A) promotes an “A-loop-out/αC-in” orientation conducive to catalysis. Crystal structures of the CDK2–cyclin A complex have revealed an extended interface that serves not only to enhance substrate specificity via docking interactions but also to facilitate the stabilization of key structural motifs that are critical for catalytic efficiency. The overall three-dimensional fold remains highly conserved among cyclin-dependent kinases, yet subtle differences in the activation loop dynamics and cyclin interaction surfaces contribute to the functional specialization of CDK2 in cell cycle regulation (wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 5-6, wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 21-22, zhang2024cdk2andcdk4 pages 1-2).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of CDK2 is multifaceted and involves several layers of control. First, its activation requires binding to specific cyclins; cyclin E association occurs during the G1/S transition while cyclin A binding predominates in the S and G2 phases. This cyclin association triggers conformational changes that reposition the αC-helix and activation loop, thereby aligning catalytic residues for efficient phosphoryl transfer. Furthermore, full CDK2 activation is achieved upon phosphorylation of the activation loop at threonine 160 by the CDK-activating kinase (CAK) complex. This phosphorylation event not only stabilizes the active conformation but also protects T160 from dephosphorylation, thereby sustaining kinase activity throughout the appropriate cell cycle phase (majumdar2021allosterygovernscdk2 pages 7-9, łukasik2021cyclindependentkinases(cdk) pages 27-29).  \nInhibition of CDK2 is mediated by cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) such as p21 and p27, which bind to the CDK2–cyclin complex to sterically block substrate access to the active site. In addition, inhibitory phosphorylation events, such as on tyrosine residues (e.g., Y15 in some CDKs), can modulate activity although this mechanism is more prominently described in CDK1 than CDK2. Other regulatory influences include allosteric interactions that can affect the conformational dynamics between the “A-loop-in” and “A-loop-out” states. Small molecule inhibitors also exploit these allosteric differences to selectively target the active or inactive conformations of CDK2, which has implications for therapeutic intervention in cancer and other proliferative disorders (majumdar2021allosterygovernscdk2 pages 3-4, wood2019differencesinthe pages 11-11, poulainUnknownyearinvestigatingp21mediateddynamic pages 147-150).\n\n7. Function  \nCDK2 has a central role in orchestrating cell cycle transitions. It is primarily active during the G1 to S phase transition and throughout DNA replication and the G2 phase. During early G1-S transition, activation of CDK2 by cyclin E permits the initiation of E2F-mediated transcription and the commencement of DNA synthesis. Later, its association with cyclin A is crucial for the proper progression of S phase and for the subsequent activation of CDK1 at the G2/M boundary. CDK2 phosphorylates a range of substrates that control critical cellular processes. For instance, phosphorylation of RB1 by CDK2 disrupts the interaction between RB1 and E2F transcription factors, thereby enabling the expression of genes necessary for S phase entry. In addition, CDK2-mediated phosphorylation of NPAT promotes activation of histone gene transcription, a prerequisite for chromatin assembly during DNA replication. CDK2 also phosphorylates substrates involved in centrosome duplication (for instance, NPM1), DNA repair pathways (such as BRCA2 and ERCC6), and transcription factors like MYC to prevent senescence under conditions of oxidative stress. Beyond these roles, CDK2 is implicated in epigenetic regulation; its phosphorylation of EZH2 has been linked to the maintenance of H3K27 trimethylation and gene silencing, while it also contributes to the regulation of telomere repair via NBN phosphorylation. This broad range of substrates links CDK2 to the regulation of cellular proliferation, maintenance of genomic stability, and coordination of the DNA damage response, making it a key node in the balance between cell proliferation, apoptosis, and DNA repair (OpenTargets Search: -CDK2, łukasik2021cyclindependentkinases(cdk) pages 29-30, somarelli2020aprecisionmedicine pages 12-14).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nCDK2 has been the subject of intense investigation because of its central role in cell cycle control and its implication in oncogenesis. Dysregulation of CDK2, often through overexpression of its cyclin partners (especially cyclin E) or through mutations affecting its regulatory domains, is frequently observed in various cancers, including breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancers. This has spurred the development and testing of several small molecule inhibitors aimed at selectively targeting CDK2 activity. Inhibitors such as roscovitine, dinaciclib, and AZD5438 have been evaluated for their potential to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells, offering promise as therapeutic agents although challenges remain in ensuring specificity given the high structural similarity among CDK family members (somarelli2020aprecisionmedicine pages 12-14, wood2019differencesinthe pages 11-11).  \nMoreover, CDK2’s role extends beyond conventional cell cycle regulation. Its involvement in the response to DNA damage, control of centrosome duplication, and modulation of transcription factor activity positions it as a critical mediator in cellular stress responses. The phosphorylation of proteins such as CTNNB1, p53/TP53, and USP37 links CDK2 activity to signaling pathways that govern both survival and apoptosis. In embryonic stem cells, for example, CDK2 orchestrates a fine balance between proliferation, differentiation, and DNA repair, underscoring its importance in early development. Current research continues to explore the diverse functions of CDK2 in both normal physiology and disease states, with efforts aimed at developing more selective inhibitors that minimize off-target effects while maximizing therapeutic efficacy (wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 2-3, majumdar2021allosterygovernscdk2 pages 1-3, łukasik2021cyclindependentkinases(cdk) pages 22-23).\n\n9.

    "answer": "1. Phylogeny  \nCyclin-dependent kinase 3 (CDK3), also known as cell division protein kinase 3, is encoded by the gene CDK3/CDKN3 and is a conserved member of the cyclin‐dependent kinase family. It is classified within the CMGC branch of the human kinome—a group that comprises cyclin-dependent kinases along with mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), glycogen synthase kinases (GSKs), and CDK-like kinases (CLKs) (alrouji2025mechanisticrolesof pages 1-2, chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 1-2). Comparative sequence analyses reveal that CDK3 possesses the conserved catalytic motifs, including the glycine-rich loop and the PSTAIRE helix that is essential for its interaction with regulatory cyclins such as cyclin-C, echoing characteristics common to other cell cycle regulators like CDK1, CDK2, CDK5 and CDK6 (nilapwar2009characterizationandexploitation pages 47-51, dowerah2025identificationofeffective pages 68-71). Such motifs have been maintained since the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA), underscoring the evolutionary pressure to preserve mechanisms that enable tight control of the cell cycle. Orthologs of CDK3 can be found broadly across eukaryotes—from unicellular organisms to mammals—which highlights its fundamental role in governing transitions between quiescent and proliferative states (pluta2024cyclin‐dependentkinasesmasters pages 1-3, chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 2-4). This deep conservation suggests that CDK3’s functional capacity in promoting cell cycle re-entry is a core characteristic maintained throughout evolution (alrouji2025mechanisticrolesof pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK3 acts as an ATP-dependent serine/threonine-protein kinase, catalyzing the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to specific serine or threonine residues on target substrates. The chemical reaction it mediates can be generalized by the equation: ATP + [protein]–(Ser/Thr) → ADP + [protein]–(phospho-Ser/Thr) + H⁺ (adams2001kineticandcatalytic pages 2-3, fischer2004thedesignof pages 1-2). In its catalytic cycle, CDK3 binds ATP and, in the presence of its requisite divalent metal ion cofactor, facilitates the nucleophilic attack by the hydroxyl group of the substrate’s serine or threonine residue. This mechanism involves kinetic steps whereby the formation of an enzyme–ATP–substrate complex is followed by phosphoryl transfer and subsequent release of ADP and the phosphorylated substrate. Among the confirmed physiological substrates for CDK3 are histone H1, activating transcription factor 1 (ATF1), retinoblastoma protein (RB1) and CABLES1 (alrouji2025mechanisticrolesof pages 1-2, pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 51-52). The phosphorylation of histone H1 may contribute to chromatin remodeling required for transcriptional changes during cell cycle re-entry, while phosphorylation of ATF1 is known to trigger its transactivation and augment its transcriptional activity, thereby promoting cell proliferation and transformation. Crucially, phosphorylation of RB1 by the CDK3/cyclin-C complex is essential for the G0-to-G1 transition as it leads to the inactivation of RB1, resulting in the subsequent activation of E2F transcription factors that drive the expression of genes necessary for S phase progression (alrouji2025mechanisticrolesof pages 1-2, pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 51-52). Additionally, phosphorylation events mediated by CDK3 may also contribute to G1-S progression in an RB1-independent fashion through the activation of E2F1, E2F2 and E2F3, further integrating cell cycle signals with transcriptional control.\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe enzymatic activity of CDK3, similar to most serine/threonine kinases, is strictly dependent on the availability of ATP and the binding of divalent metal ions. Magnesium (Mg²⁺) is the principal cofactor that binds ATP and stabilizes its phosphate groups, ensuring the correct orientation and reactivity required for the phosphotransfer reaction (chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 2-4, adams2001kineticandcatalytic pages 2-3). This Mg²⁺ ion not only aids in the binding of ATP within the conserved active site but also significantly influences the reaction kinetics by coordinating with catalytic residues, thus facilitating the efficient transfer of the phosphate group to the substrate. Although other divalent ions such as manganese (Mn²⁺) have been known to partially support kinase activity in in vitro assays, Mg²⁺ remains the physiologically relevant metal ion for CDK3 activity (fischer2004thedesignof pages 1-2). Furthermore, the local concentration of ATP and Mg²⁺ in the cell can modulate the kinase activity of CDK3, fine-tuning its function during specific cell cycle phases when rapid phosphorylation of key substrates is required.\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCDK3 exhibits a substrate specificity that is essential for its roles in driving cell cycle transitions and regulating transcription. Among its well-characterized substrates are histone H1, ATF1, the retinoblastoma protein (RB1), and CABLES1 (alrouji2025mechanisticrolesof pages 1-2, pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 2-4). Phosphorylation of histone H1 is thought to influence chromatin structure and thereby affect gene accessibility necessary for cell cycle progression. When CDK3 phosphorylates ATF1, the modification enhances ATF1’s transactivation and transcriptional functions, leading to the upregulation of proliferative and transformation-associated genes (pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 2-4). One of the critical functions of CDK3 is the phosphorylation of RB1, which results in the attenuation of RB1’s ability to repress E2F transcription factors. This event is pivotal for the transition of cells out of the quiescent G0 phase into the G1 phase and further supports progression into the S phase (pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 51-52, chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 4-6). In addition, CDK3 is believed to target specific serine/threonine residues within a proline-directed context—the so-called S/T-P motif—a common recognition element among CDKs that aids in substrate selection and proper orientation of the peptide substrate in the active site (johnson2023anatlasof pages 3-4, johnson2023anatlasof pages 4-4). Although a comprehensive consensus sequence exclusive to CDK3 has not been fully delineated in the current literature, the S/T-P motif underlies the mechanistic basis for substrate recognition across many cyclin-dependent kinases, ensuring that CDK3 phosphorylates only select proteins integral to the regulation of cell cycle checkpoints and transcription.\n\n5. Structure  \nThe structural organization of CDK3 adheres to the canonical features observed in cyclin-dependent kinases. Its central component is a conserved kinase domain that is typically about 250–300 amino acids in length and is organized into two main lobes: an N-terminal lobe and a larger C-terminal lobe (wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2, klenor2021rationaldesignof pages 13-16). The N-terminal lobe, enriched in β-sheets, contains the glycine-rich loop crucial for ATP binding. This loop is a key element that allows CDK3 to position the nucleotide correctly within the active site. In addition, the N-terminal lobe harbors the PSTAIRE helix, which is essential for the binding of cyclin-C—a critical interaction that drives the activation of CDK3 (wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2). The larger C-terminal lobe is predominantly helical and includes the activation loop (T-loop), where phosphorylation events are known to trigger conformational rearrangements resulting in full kinase activation (klenor2021rationaldesignof pages 34-36). Structural models derived from homologous kinases, such as CDK2, indicate that CDK3 most likely contains well-conserved residues in motifs such as HRD (His-Arg-Asp) and DFG (Asp-Phe-Gly) that are indispensable for catalytic turnover and proper substrate orientation (wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 20-20, klenor2021rationaldesignof pages 34-36). Although high-resolution crystal structures for CDK3 are not yet widely available, recent computational studies using tools like AlphaFold have begun to shed light on the three-dimensional arrangement of the active site. These models reaffirm the overall bilobal structure of CDK3 while also indicating subtle structural variations in the cyclin-binding interface that may explain its preferential interaction with cyclin-C during interphase (pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 51-52, pluta2024investigatingtherole pages 291-294). Such structural nuances not only underpin CDK3’s catalytic activity but also differentiate its functional behavior from other CDKs with overlapping roles in cell cycle control.\n\n6. Regulation  \nCDK3 is regulated by a multifaceted network of mechanisms that ensure its activity is precisely coordinated with the cell cycle. The primary regulatory event is its association with cyclin-C (CCNC), which is indispensable for initiating the conformational changes necessary to open the active site and permit substrate binding (alrouji2025mechanisticrolesof pages 1-2, chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 4-6). In isolation, CDK3 remains in a relatively inactive state; however, upon binding cyclin-C, its structure rearranges to allow efficient ATP binding and subsequent phosphorylation reactions. In addition to cyclin association, phosphorylation of CDK3’s activation loop (T-loop) by CDK-activating kinases (CAKs) is believed to be crucial for achieving full catalytic competence (klenor2021rationaldesignof pages 34-36, nilapwar2009characterizationandexploitation pages 47-51). Although specific phosphorylation sites on CDK3 have not been exhaustively mapped in the current literature, insights drawn from related CDKs suggest that such phosphorylation fosters a conformational transition that stabilizes the active site. Further regulation of CDK3 may also occur through post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination, which can target the protein for proteasomal degradation once its role in facilitating the G0-to-G1 transition has been fulfilled; this process prevents unwarranted kinase activity that might lead to aberrant cell cycle progression (chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 2-4, pluta2024cyclin‐dependentkinasesmasters pages 12-14). In addition, the interplay with cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs)—although not as well characterized for CDK3 as for other family members—provides an extra layer of negative regulation, thereby ensuring that CDK3 activity is tightly synchronized with cellular proliferation needs (dowerah2025identificationofeffective pages 68-71). Together, these regulatory mechanisms—cyclin binding, activation loop phosphorylation, and targeted degradation—secure CDK3’s pivotal role during the early phases of cell cycle re-entry.\n\n7. Function  \nCDK3 functions as a pivotal regulator of cell cycle re-entry and progression, primarily orchestrating the transitions from the quiescent G0 state into the proliferative G1 phase and facilitating progression into the S phase. One of the most significant functions of CDK3 is its ability to phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein (RB1). This phosphorylation – mediated by the CDK3/cyclin-C complex – results in the inactivation of RB1’s repressive effects on E2F transcription factors, effectively licensing the transcriptional programs required for DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression (alrouji2025mechanisticrolesof pages 1-2, pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 51-52). In addition to RB1, CDK3 phosphorylates ATF1, a transcription factor whose activation leads to enhanced transactivation of genes that promote cellular proliferation and transformation (pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 2-4). This dual role—targeting both cell cycle regulators like RB1 and transcriptional modulators such as ATF1—positions CDK3 as a bifunctional integrator, linking cell cycle progression with the modulation of gene expression. Furthermore, evidence suggests that CDK3 might also contribute to the G1-S transition independently of RB1 by promoting the activation of E2F family members (specifically E2F1, E2F2 and E2F3), thereby reinforcing the transcriptional upregulation of genes essential for S phase entry (pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 9-10, hunter2015theeukaryoticprotein pages 1-3). Expression studies indicate that CDK3 is predominantly active during interphase, correlating with its functional role in facilitating the exit from quiescence and the initiation of DNA replication. This central function is particularly pertinent in tissues requiring rapid regeneration, as well as in oncogenic contexts where dysregulated CDK3 activity may drive uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumor progression (pluta2024investigatingtherole pages 60-62, sabri2024insightsintocyclindependent pages 27-30). Thus, CDK3 serves as a key modulator not only of cell cycle checkpoints but also of transcription-driven proliferative programs.\n\n8. Other Comments  \nRecent studies have underscored the potential of CDK3 as a promising therapeutic target, particularly in the context of oncology. Multi-level computational screening has identified candidate inhibitors that selectively target the ATP-binding pocket of CDK3, offering a more refined alternative to broad-spectrum CDK inhibitors such as dinaciclib (dowerah2025identificationofeffective pages 68-71, fischer2004thedesignof pages 1-2). While inhibitors originally developed for other CDKs may exhibit cross-reactivity with CDK3, there remains a pressing need for compounds with enhanced specificity to minimize off-target effects. Moreover, integrative omics approaches that combine transcriptomic and epigenomic data have begun to reveal that even under-characterized kinases like CDK3 can serve as valuable prognostic markers or diagnostic targets in various cancers (southekal2021integrativeanalysisof pages 120-124). Current research is also focused on employing advanced phospho-proteomic techniques and proximity labeling strategies to expand our understanding of the CDK3 substrate repertoire and elucidate its role within complex signaling networks. Although direct disease-associated mutations in CDK3 have not been well documented, its central role in permitting G0-to-G1 and G1-to-S transitions implies that dysregulation of CDK3 activity could contribute to oncogenic transformation. Future research aimed at detailed structural elucidation, kinetic characterization and the development of selective inhibitors will be essential to fully exploit the therapeutic potential of CDK3. Furthermore, ongoing studies are expected to provide deeper insights into regulatory mechanisms such as post-translational modifications and protein–protein interactions that modulate CDK3 activity during cellular stress and differentiation responses (sharp2024manuscriptwithfigures. pages 6-10).\n\n9.

    "answer": "1. Phylogeny  \nCyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) is a member of the serine/threonine kinase family that evolved early among eukaryotes and is classified within the group of cell cycle–regulating CDKs. Phylogenetically, CDK6 is closely related to CDK4, and together they share unique features that distinguish them from other cell cycle kinases such as CDK2. Both CDK6 and CDK4 exhibit a high degree of sequence conservation in the catalytic domain and are evolutionarily conserved across mammalian species, reflecting their critical roles in cell cycle control. In addition, although CDK6 diverged from other CDKs at an early stage, it retains a conserved kinase fold with an N-terminal lobe rich in β-sheets and a larger C-terminal lobe (as seen in structural studies and comparative analyses) (asghar2015thehistoryand pages 1-2, korolchuk2018structuralandfunctional pages 31-35). Orthologs of CDK6 have been identified in several metazoans, and genetic studies in mice have confirmed that CDK6 plays nonredundant roles in processes such as thymocyte development and neurogenesis, underscoring its conserved function in diverse cell types (tigan2016cdk6—areviewof pages 1-2, hallett2017structuralandfunctional pages 27-30).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK6 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to specific serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins. The canonical reaction involves ATP and a protein substrate containing an accessible serine/threonine residue to yield ADP and the phosphorylated protein. Physiologically, CDK6 phosphorylates targets such as the retinoblastoma protein (pRB/RB1) and nucleophosmin (NPM1), which results in conformational and functional changes critical for the regulation of cell cycle progression from the G1 to S phase. This phosphorylation leads to the inactivation of pRB, liberating E2F transcription factors that promote the transcription of genes essential for DNA synthesis and progression through the cell cycle (asghar2015thehistoryand pages 9-10, tadesse2015targetingcdk6in pages 35-38).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of CDK6 depends primarily on ATP, which serves as the phosphate donor in its phosphorylation reaction. Like many serine/threonine protein kinases, CDK6 also requires the presence of divalent metal ions, typically Mg²⁺, to coordinate ATP binding and stabilize the transition state during catalysis. These cofactors are essential for proper substrate orientation and for the efficient transfer of the phosphoryl group (korolchuk2018structuralandfunctional pages 168-171, tadesse2018cyclindependentkinase2 pages 4-8).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCDK6 exhibits substrate specificity characteristic of cell cycle kinases, with a strong preference for phosphorylating serine/threonine residues within particular sequence contexts. Its best-characterized substrate is the retinoblastoma protein (pRB), where phosphorylation at multiple sites is critical for the release of E2F transcription factors and subsequent cell cycle progression. In addition to pRB, CDK6 phosphorylates NPM1 and has been reported to modulate the activity of other cell cycle regulatory proteins. Although an exact consensus motif for CDK6 is not uniformly defined across all studies, the structural and biochemical analyses indicate that substrate recognition involves a complementary binding interface formed by the catalytic domain and the associated D-type cyclins, which facilitate precise substrate docking (asghar2015thehistoryand pages 4-5, tadesse2015targetingcdk6in pages 6-9, wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 10-11).\n\n5. Structure  \nCDK6 is a 326-amino-acid serine/threonine kinase consisting primarily of a conserved kinase domain that is organized into a bilobal structure. The N-terminal lobe of CDK6 contains several antiparallel β-sheets and a key α-helix that is critical for cyclin binding, while the larger C-terminal lobe is predominantly composed of α-helices and houses the activation loop (T-loop) along with the substrate-binding and ATP-binding sites. Essential structural elements include the glycine-rich P-loop, which is responsible for anchoring the phosphates of ATP, and conserved motifs such as the catalytic loop and DFG motif, which ensure proper alignment of catalytic residues. Upon binding to D-type cyclins (such as cyclin D1, D2, or D3), CDK6 undergoes a conformational rearrangement that positions the αC-helix in an “in” conformation, thereby allowing critical interactions between the kinase and its substrates. Additionally, interaction with cyclins not only activates the kinase but also contributes to substrate specificity by providing complementary contact surfaces. High-resolution structures and crystallographic studies, including those demonstrating the CDK6 complexes with cyclin D and inhibitors (e.g., the structural insights from INK4 inhibitor studies), further highlight unique aspects of CDK6 regulation and activation (hallett2017structuralandfunctional pages 223-226, tadesse2015targetingcdk6in pages 9-13, wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 14-15).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe activity of CDK6 is tightly regulated by multiple mechanisms. A primary mode of regulation involves its association with D-type cyclins (D1, D2, D3) during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, which is necessary for its activation and for proper substrate orientation. In addition, CDK6 is regulated by CDK inhibitory proteins (CKIs), notably those in the INK4 family (such as p16^INK4A and p19^INK4D) that bind to monomeric CDK6 or the CDK6–cyclin complexes to inhibit kinase activity. Members of the Cip/Kip family (e.g., p21^Cip1 and p27^Kip1) also interact with CDK6–cyclin complexes; interestingly, these proteins can have dual roles by sometimes facilitating complex assembly and nuclear localization, while in other contexts inhibiting catalytic activity. Furthermore, phosphorylation plays a critical role in CDK6 regulation. Phosphorylation of residues within the T-loop by the CDK-activating kinase (CAK) is necessary to achieve full kinase activity, while inhibitory phosphorylation events mediated by kinases such as Wee1 or Myt1 can reduce CDK6’s activity. Chaperone systems involving proteins such as Hsp90 and Cdc37 have also been shown to assist in the correct folding, stabilization, and maturation of CDK6, ensuring that only appropriately assembled kinase complexes are active (tadesse2015targetingcdk6in pages 13-16, tigan2016cdk6—areviewof pages 2-3, korolchuk2018structuralandfunctional pages 26-31).\n\n7. Function  \nCDK6 is a critical regulator of cell cycle progression, predominantly controlling the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase. Its canonical function is to phosphorylate key substrates such as pRB, leading to the release of E2F transcription factors that actively promote the transcription of genes required for DNA replication and cell cycle progression. Beyond its central role in cell cycle control, CDK6 is involved in regulating cell differentiation; it plays a dual role by both supporting cell proliferation in certain lineages (for example, erythroid and hematopoietic cells) and promoting cell cycle exit during differentiation in other contexts. In the developing central nervous system, CDK6 is essential within the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles, where it promotes the production of newborn neurons by modulating the duration of the G1 phase. CDK6 is also important during thymocyte development and in regulating myeloid progenitor proliferation. Intriguingly, CDK6 possesses kinase-independent functions as well; in astrocytes, for example, it modulates the actin cytoskeleton, leading to loss of stress fibers and enhanced motility during differentiation. Additionally, in the context of myeloid cells, CDK6 prevents differentiation by interfering with the transcriptional activator RUNX1, thereby maintaining a proliferative state. This multifunctionality underscores the pivotal role of CDK6 not only in cell cycle progression but also in lineage commitment, morphogenesis, and potentially in cellular senescence delays (asghar2015thehistoryand pages 15-16, giovanni2016investigationaldrugstargeting pages 34-38, tigan2016cdk6—areviewof pages 7-8).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nCDK6 is a validated target in oncology due to its essential role in driving cell proliferation and its frequent dysregulation in cancer. Several selective inhibitors have been developed that target the ATP-binding pocket of CDK6, and many of these agents – including Palbociclib, Ribociclib, and Abemaciclib – are currently in clinical use or undergoing trials for the treatment of hormone receptor–positive breast cancer and other malignancies. In addition to its kinase-dependent activity, the transcriptional regulatory functions of CDK6 have spurred investigations into novel therapeutic strategies aimed at disrupting both its catalytic and scaffolding roles. While mutations in CDK6 itself appear less common than alterations in its regulatory partners (such as p16^INK4A), overexpression and aberrant activation of CDK6 are well documented in various cancers, including lymphoid neoplasms and gliomas. The intricate balance between cyclin binding, CKI interactions, and post-translational modifications remains an active area of research, with new insights regularly emerging on how best to modulate CDK6 activity for therapeutic benefit (goel2022targetingcdk4and pages 1-3, tadesse2015targetingcdk6in pages 16-20, wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 19-20, hallett2017structuralandfunctional pages 38-42).\n\n9.

    "answer": "1. Phylogeny  \nCyclin-dependent kinase 10 (CDK10) is a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase family that emerged early in eukaryotic evolution. It is classified within the transcriptional CDK subfamily as opposed to the cell cycle–oriented CDKs. CDK10 was discovered by virtue of its sequence homology to the yeast Cdc2 PSTAIRE domain and shares approximately 38–45% sequence identity with other CDKs, positioning it phylogenetically among kinases that regulate transcription rather than direct cell division (bazzi2021cdk10ingastrointestinal pages 2-4, colas2020cyclindependentkinasesand pages 1-2). Its evolutionary relationship with other CDKs is further underscored by conserved catalytic motifs that are found among many eukaryotic serine/threonine kinases. Although detailed studies on orthologs have not been as extensive as for some other family members, available data suggest that CDK10 orthologs with a similar domain organization exist in several metazoans, and its close evolutionary relatives include members of the CDK11 subgroup (chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 21-22). Furthermore, alternative splicing generating both a full-length active isoform and a truncated inactive variant appears conserved in higher eukaryotes, reflecting an evolutionary mechanism for tuning kinase activity.\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK10 catalyzes a prototypical kinase reaction in which the γ-phosphate transferred from ATP is covalently attached to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins. Its catalytic reaction can be summarized as: ATP + [protein]-(L‑serine or L‑threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L‑serine/threonine‑phosphate) + H⁺ (duster2021biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 86-89, duster2022functionalcharacterizationof pages 9-10). One of the best characterized substrates is the transcription factor ETS2; CDK10 phosphorylates ETS2, promoting its proteasomal degradation and thereby acting as a negative regulator of ETS2-driven transcription (guen2017theawakeningof pages 1-2). In addition, CDK10 phosphorylates protein kinase C–like 2 (PKN2); this phosphorylation regulates actin cytoskeleton organization by modulating RhoA signaling and ultimately suppresses ciliogenesis (guen2017theawakeningof pages 1-2, pluta2024investigatingtherole pages 62-63). The reaction mechanism, typical of serine/threonine kinases, involves binding both ATP and the substrate via the catalytic cleft in the kinase domain followed by nucleophilic attack from the substrate hydroxyl group on the γ-phosphate of ATP, releasing ADP as a byproduct (duster2021biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 93-97).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of CDK10, as with most protein kinases, is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions. Magnesium (Mg²⁺) is required for optimal kinase activity as it coordinates the ATP molecule within the active site, facilitating correct positioning of the γ-phosphate for transfer (duster2021biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 86-89). Although not explicitly detailed in every study, this requirement is a common feature among cyclin-dependent kinases, and no alternative metal cofactor (such as Mn²⁺) has been distinctly reported for CDK10. Thus, Mg²⁺ is the primary and essential cofactor for catalysis.\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nThe substrate specificity of CDK10 is defined both by the presence of consensus phosphorylation motifs and by its protein–protein interactions that are mediated through binding partners such as Cyclin M. One well‐established substrate is ETS2, where CDK10 phosphorylates specific serine residues that form a phosphodegron, tagging ETS2 for ubiquitin‐mediated degradation (guen2017theawakeningof pages 2-3). Additionally, the kinase phosphorylates PKN2, a regulator of actin dynamics; this modification contributes to the control of the RhoA signaling pathway, indirectly impacting cytoskeletal organization and ciliogenesis (pluta2024investigatingtherole pages 62-63). While the minimal consensus sequence for many cyclin-dependent kinases is often characterized by an (S/T)P motif, evidence suggests that CDK10’s substrate recognition might be similarly centered on serine/threonine residues followed by proline (duster2022functionalcharacterizationof pages 6-7). However, studies employing analogue-sensitive mutants and mass spectrometry have indicated that CDK10 may also phosphorylate non-canonical sites in context-dependent manners, likely influenced by distal regions and the tertiary structure of the substrate (duster2022functionalcharacterizationof pages 6-7, duster2022functionalcharacterizationof pages 8-9). Therefore, while ETS2 and PKN2 remain the primary physiological substrates, its substrate specificity may extend to additional proteins involved in transcription regulation, cell cycle progression, and cytoskeletal organization.\n\n5. Structure  \nCDK10 is a 360–amino acid protein in its full-length active form, characterized by a central kinase domain that is flanked by regulatory regions. The active isoform contains conserved motifs common to cyclin-dependent kinases, such as the PISSLRE motif—an atypical variation of the PSTAIRE helix that is important for the association with its cyclin partner, Cyclin M (bazzi2021cdk10ingastrointestinal pages 2-4, duster2021biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 86-89). Key catalytic residues include an essential aspartate (often around position 163) that functions as a proton acceptor during phosphoryl transfer (duster2021biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 86-89). Additionally, a conserved threonine residue within the activation loop (commonly identified as Thr196) is critical for kinase activation; phosphorylation at this site is a prerequisite for full activity, although the kinase may form a complex with Cyclin M even in the absence of this modification (duster2022functionalcharacterizationof pages 2-3). The structural organization in CDK10 resembles that seen in other CDKs, with an N-terminal lobe primarily involved in ATP binding and a larger C-terminal lobe containing substrate recognition elements. Alternative splicing of the CDK10 gene produces a shorter, 272–amino acid isoform that lacks the ATP-binding domain, rendering it catalytically inactive, which underscores the importance of full-length structure for kinase function (bazzi2021cdk10ingastrointestinal pages 2-4, colas2020cyclindependentkinasesand pages 1-2). Structural models generated via homology modeling and recent AlphaFold predictions have provided additional insight into the three-dimensional conformation of CDK10, revealing the spatial arrangement of the catalytic and regulatory regions that are essential for its interaction with Cyclin M and for substrate binding (duster2021biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 112-116, duster2022functionalcharacterizationof pages 1-2).\n\n6. Regulation  \nCDK10 is regulated by several converging mechanisms that modulate both its abundance and catalytic activity. The primary mode of regulation is through its association with Cyclin M, which is mandatory for the kinase activity of CDK10; in the absence of Cyclin M, the kinase remains inactive and is more susceptible to ubiquitin-mediated degradation (guen2017theawakeningof pages 1-2, duster2022functionalcharacterizationof pages 2-2). Furthermore, alternative splicing of the CDK10 mRNA results in the production of isoforms with distinct regulatory properties, such as the full-length enzymatically active variant and a truncated, inactive form lacking the ATP-binding domain (bazzi2021cdk10ingastrointestinal pages 2-4, colas2020cyclindependentkinasesand pages 1-2). Post-translational modifications play a crucial role in its regulation as well. Phosphorylation of Thr196 in the activation loop is critical for activation, a modification that is necessary for catalytic function, though the upstream kinase responsible for this phosphorylation event has not been definitively identified in the literature (duster2021biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 86-89, duster2022functionalcharacterizationof pages 2-3). In addition, CDK10 interacts with the prolyl isomerase Pin1, which has been reported to affect its function in estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer by influencing its stability and degradation (guen2017theawakeningof pages 2-3). CDK10 is also subject to regulatory degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and Cyclin M binding serves to stabilize CDK10, thereby protecting it from degradation (guen2017theawakeningof pages 2-3). Such multi-layered regulation ensures that CDK10 activity is tightly controlled, with its levels and activity being modulated in response to developmental cues and cellular stress, as well as in the context of tumor progression and drug resistance (pluta2024investigatingtherole pages 62-63, łukasik2021cyclindependentkinases(cdk) pages 18-19).\n\n7. Function  \nFunctionally, CDK10 is involved in a diverse array of cellular processes that extend from transcription regulation to the control of cytoskeletal dynamics. One of its best characterized functions is the phosphorylation of the transcription factor ETS2. By phosphorylating ETS2, CDK10 facilitates its proteasomal degradation, thereby modulating transcriptional programs that are critical for cell proliferation and differentiation. This function of CDK10 in ETS2 regulation positions it as a tumor suppressor in certain contexts, although its functional role may vary with tissue type and subcellular context (guen2017theawakeningof pages 1-2, bazzi2021cdk10ingastrointestinal pages 2-4). In parallel, CDK10 phosphorylates PKN2, a kinase involved in actin cytoskeleton organization. Phosphorylation of PKN2 by CDK10 is linked to the regulation of RhoA signaling, which in turn controls the formation and maintenance of actin stress fibers and represses ciliogenesis. This negative regulation of ciliogenesis is significant given that alterations in primary cilium dynamics are implicated in developmental disorders such as STAR syndrome and may influence tumor progression (pluta2024investigatingtherole pages 62-63, duster2022functionalcharacterizationof pages 3-4). CDK10 has also been implicated in cell cycle regulation, particularly in the promotion of the G2/M transition, and alterations in its expression have been correlated with differences in cell proliferation rates in various cancers (colas2020cyclindependentkinasesand pages 1-2, bazzi2021cdk10ingastrointestinal pages 2-4). Collectively, the functions of CDK10 span the regulation of transcription through degradation of key transcription factors, control of cytoskeletal and ciliogenesis pathways via phosphorylation of actin-regulatory kinases, and modulation of cell cycle progression, thereby impacting developmental processes and oncogenic signaling pathways.\n\n8. Other Comments  \nDespite its critical roles in regulating ETS2 degradation, actin dynamics, and ciliogenesis, specific pharmacological inhibitors targeting CDK10 have not been as well developed or characterized as those for other CDKs. The absence of selective inhibitors continues to pose a challenge in fully dissecting its functions in normal and pathological contexts, although the dual role of CDK10 as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogenic driver in different tissues makes it an attractive target for future therapeutic development (guen2017theawakeningof pages 1-2, pluta2024investigatingtherole pages 62-63). Additionally, mutations in the CDK10 gene or alterations in its splicing that result in the production of inactive isoforms have been associated with developmental disorders such as Al Kaissi syndrome and may overlap with features seen in STAR syndrome due to defects in Cyclin M (colas2020cyclindependentkinasesand pages 1-2, łukasik2021cyclindependentkinases(cdk) pages 18-19). Ongoing research continues to explore the substrate spectrum of CDK10 and its broader roles in transcriptional control as well as in the maintenance of cellular architecture. Given its involvement in a wide array of cellular processes—from transcription regulation to the actin cytoskeleton and ciliary dynamics—CDK10 remains a focus of active research with potential implications for the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.\n\n9.

    "answer": "## 1. Phylogeny  \nCyclin‐dependent kinase 14 (CDK14), also known as PFTK1 or PCTAIRE‐1, belongs to an atypical subfamily of cyclin‐dependent kinases that also comprises CDK15–CDK18. Phylogenetically, CDK14 shares significant sequence conservation in its catalytic domain with other members of this group, particularly those within the PFTAIRE/PCTAIRE family, and shows a closer relationship with CDK5, as evidenced by its position within the CDK5 subfamily clade (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 114-118, mikolcevic2012orphankinasesturn pages 1-2). These kinases are evolutionarily conserved across metazoans, with CDK14 orthologs identified in vertebrates and many invertebrates. Moreover, evolutionary studies suggest that while classical cell cycle CDKs (such as CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6) emerged early in eukaryotic evolution, CDK14 along with its atypical counterparts appear later, concomitant with the evolution of more specialized cellular processes including neuronal differentiation and complex developmental programs (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418a pages 32-35, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 1-2).\n\n## 2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK14 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation reaction in which a phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is transferred to serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins. The reaction can be described as:  \n  ATP + [protein]–(L-serine/threonine) → ADP + [protein]–(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺.  \nA well‐characterized substrate of CDK14 is the low‐density lipoprotein receptor‐related protein 6 (LRP6), where CDK14 phosphorylates Serine-1490. This phosphorylation event occurs during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and serves to “prime” LRP6 and thereby activate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 114-118, alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 38-41). In vitro studies have also demonstrated that CDK14 can phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein (RB1); however, the in vivo relevance of this activity remains to be conclusively determined (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 35-38).\n\n## 3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of CDK14, like that of most CDKs, is strictly dependent on certain cofactors. A critical cofactor is magnesium (Mg²⁺), which is essential for ATP binding and the subsequent transfer of the phosphate group (general CDK mechanism, inferred from accepted kinase chemistry). In addition, the full activation of CDK14 requires its association with regulatory cyclin partners. Cyclin Y has been identified as the primary cyclin that binds CDK14, facilitating not only its activation but also determining its subcellular localization, particularly recruiting the complex to the plasma membrane through cyclin Y’s N-myristoylation signal (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 114-118, mikolcevic2012orphankinasesturn pages 1-2).\n\n## 4. Substrate Specificity  \nCDK14 displays substrate specificity typical of serine/threonine kinases; however, its substrate preference is modulated by its cyclin regulatory partner. In its active state, CDK14 phosphorylates serine or threonine residues within target proteins that are critical for mediating cell cycle regulatory events and signaling pathways. A key physiological substrate is LRP6, phosphorylated at Ser-1490, which is a pivotal event in the activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway during the G2/M phase (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 114-118). In vitro studies have also indicated that CDK14 is capable of targeting RB1, though the physiological relevance of this phosphorylation requires further validation (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 35-38). While a precise consensus motif is less defined compared to other CDKs, CDK14’s substrate recognition appears to be influenced by the presence of specific residues in proximity to the phosphorylation site, in conjunction with the membrane localization conferred by cyclin Y binding (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418a pages 29-32).\n\n## 5. Structure  \nStructurally, CDK14 consists of a conserved serine/threonine kinase catalytic domain of approximately 300 amino acids that contains the hallmark motifs of the CMGC kinase family, such as the DFG motif critical for ATP binding and the HRD motif required for catalysis (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 6-7, mikolcevic2012orphankinasesturn pages 3-4). In addition to the central kinase domain, CDK14 harbors variable N-terminal and C-terminal extensions. These extensions play key roles in mediating interactions with cyclin partners—most notably cyclin Y—as well as other regulatory proteins. The cyclin Y binding is critical not only for the activation of CDK14 but also for its correct subcellular targeting, as the N-myristoylation of cyclin Y directs the complex to the plasma membrane, a feature that is uncommon in classical cell cycle CDKs (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 114-118, alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418a pages 32-35). Furthermore, CDK14 contains a PFTAIRE motif (in some reports distinguished as a variant of the PCTAIRE motif), which is a signature sequence that distinguishes it from other CDKs and contributes to its unique regulatory and substrate recognition properties (mikolcevic2012orphankinasesturn pages 1-2).\n\n## 6. Regulation  \nThe activation and regulation of CDK14 are multi-layered and critically dependent on its interaction with regulatory proteins and post-translational modifications. The primary mode of activation is through binding to cyclin Y, which leads to a conformational change and subsequent activation of the kinase catalytic domain (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 114-118, alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418a pages 32-35). Cyclin Y binds through conserved regions in both its own cyclin box and complementary regions in CDK14. In addition to cyclin binding, phosphorylation events are involved in the fine-tuning of CDK14 activity. Although specific phosphorylation sites on CDK14 have been less thoroughly characterized compared to classical CDKs, evidence indicates that phosphorylation by other kinases (for example, PKA-mediated events observed in related CDKs) might modulate its association with cyclin Y or other cofactors (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418a pages 29-32). CDK14 activity may also be regulated by interactions with scaffold proteins such as 14-3-3 proteins, which in some contexts bind phosphorylated residues and further modulate kinase activity, stability, and subcellular distribution (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 114-118). Finally, there is emerging evidence that CDK14 can participate in feedback loops whereby it phosphorylates its regulatory partners (e.g., influencing cyclin Y stability via formation of phospho-degron motifs), thus ensuring tight control over its own activity during the cell cycle (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418a pages 41-44).\n\n## 7. Function  \nCDK14 functions as a key serine/threonine kinase involved in several critical cellular processes, particularly those associated with the regulation of the cell cycle and signaling pathways. One of its best characterized roles is in the regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway. By phosphorylating the extracellular receptor co‐factor LRP6 at Ser-1490 during the G2/M phase, CDK14 primes LRP6 for subsequent activation events. This phosphorylation is crucial for the propagation of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade, which is pivotal to cell fate determination, proliferation, and developmental processes (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 114-118, alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418a pages 38-41). Moreover, CDK14 has been implicated in cell cycle regulation beyond its effect on Wnt signaling. It may exert its influence by phosphorylating substrates such as RB1, which is a central regulator of G1/S transition, although this activity has so far been demonstrated largely in vitro and awaits further in vivo confirmation (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 35-38).  \nIn addition to its role in cell cycle control, CDK14 is suggested to play roles in specialized processes such as meiosis and neuronal differentiation. Its tissue expression pattern, with notable expression in postmitotic differentiated neuronal cells and reproductive tissues, supports the idea that CDK14 functions outside of classical mitotic regulation. For instance, in neuronal systems, CDK14 may regulate aspects of polarized protein trafficking and neurite outgrowth, thereby contributing to proper neuronal function and development (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 114-118, mikolcevic2012orphankinasesturn pages 6-8). Furthermore, emerging data indicate that CDK14 might be involved in the modulation of insulin-responsive glucose transport, acting indirectly as a negative regulator of glucose receptor trafficking, and thus may have metabolic implications (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 41-44). Finally, in the context of cancer, aberrant expression or dysregulation of CDK14 has been linked with enhanced cell motility, migration, and invasion. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other malignancies such as gastric and cutaneous melanoma, elevated CDK14 expression correlates with more aggressive tumor phenotypes and metastasis rather than with direct alterations in proliferation, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target to interfere with tumor metastasis and invasion (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 41-44, ferguson2019discoveryofcovalent pages 1-3).\n\n## 8. Other Comments  \nCurrently, selective pharmacological inhibitors directed against CDK14 are not as well developed as those for other cell cycle CDKs (e.g., CDK4/6 inhibitors). Recent research, however, has provided promising leads with the development of covalent inhibitors that target unique residues such as Cys218 located in the hinge region of CDK14; these inhibitors demonstrate pan‐TAIRE family specificity and serve as valuable chemical probes for dissecting CDK14 function (ferguson2019discoveryofcovalent pages 1-3, ferguson2019discoveryofcovalent pages 3-4). Disease associations for CDK14 extend primarily to oncogenesis, with its hyperactivity and overexpression implicated in metastatic features of cancers – for instance, correlating with poor prognosis in cutaneous melanoma and hepatocellular carcinoma (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 41-44). Mutational analyses and loss-of-function studies further suggest that CDK14, while not critical for basal cell viability in many adult tissues, may contribute to tumor invasion and metastasis by modulating actin cytoskeletal dynamics as well as through its regulation of Wnt signaling. Additionally, its role in neuronal and reproductive tissues continues to stimulate research into its potential involvement in neurodegenerative conditions and reproductive disorders. Ongoing studies aim to better define its substrate repertoire, activation mechanisms, and the precise interplay between its phosphorylation activity and downstream cellular functions. As new selective inhibitors are refined, further research will likely elucidate CDK14’s full clinical relevance and help in designing therapeutic strategies that target its activity with minimal side effects (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 114-118, ferguson2019discoveryofcovalent pages 12-13).\n\n## 9.

    "answer": "## 1. Phylogeny  \nCyclin‐dependent kinase 15 (CDK15), also known by alternative names PFTK2 and ALS2CR7, is classified within the cyclin‐dependent kinase family. Unlike the canonical cell cycle CDKs (e.g., CDK1, CDK2) or the transcriptional CDKs (e.g., CDK7, CDK9), CDK15 belongs to an atypical subgroup that includes several kinases with less‐defined roles, sometimes grouped together with the PCTAIRE kinases (CDK14, CDK16–18) (karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 1-2, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 2-4). Although extensive phylogenetic trees have not been published specifically for CDK15, available evidence based on its sequence homology supports its inclusion within the broader CMGC kinase group, which encompasses serine/threonine kinases involved in cell cycle regulation and transcription. Orthologs of CDK15 can be identified in various mammalian species, indicating that this kinase is an evolutionarily conserved component of the metazoan kinome. Its evolutionary trajectory suggests that while the common ancestor of eukaryotes possessed a core set of CDKs, subsequent gene duplications and divergence have given rise to atypical kinases such as CDK15 with specialized or even tissue‐specific roles (karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 1-2, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 1-2).\n\n## 2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK15 functions as a serine/threonine protein kinase whose classical catalytic activity involves transferring a phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues on target substrates. In the case of CDK15, a well‐documented substrate is the antiapoptotic protein survivin (also known as BIRC5). CDK15 phosphorylates survivin at threonine 34 (Thr34), an event that has been shown to counteract TRAIL/TNFSF10-induced apoptosis. Thus, the overall reaction catalyzed by CDK15 can be summarized as follows:  \n  ATP + survivin (protein with a free –OH on Thr34) → ADP + survivin phosphorylated on Thr34 + H⁺  \nThis phosphorylation event is thought to enhance the antiapoptotic function of survivin, thereby promoting cell survival under apoptotic stress (liao2016therolesand pages 12-13, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 1-2).\n\n## 3. Cofactor Requirements  \nAs with most cyclin-dependent kinases, CDK15 requires divalent metal ions to support its catalytic activity. The prevailing evidence from studies on related serine/threonine kinases suggests that the kinase domain of CDK15 relies on Mg²⁺ ions to coordinate ATP binding and facilitate phosphoryl transfer (karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 1-2, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 3-5). Although specific experimental data for CDK15's cofactor dependency have not been detailed separately, the conserved nature of the catalytic mechanism among CDKs implies that Mg²⁺ is the essential cofactor. Additional regulatory molecules such as specific cyclin partners (if present for CDK15) may also modulate its activity, although direct evidence for such regulatory cofactors in the case of CDK15 remains limited (duster2021biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 23-28).\n\n## 4. Substrate Specificity  \nCDK15 exhibits substrate specificity characteristic of serine/threonine kinases in the CDK family. Its most well-characterized substrate is survivin (BIRC5), which is phosphorylated at Thr34. This post-translational modification is crucial for CDK15’s antiapoptotic activity: by phosphorylating survivin at Thr34, CDK15 contributes to resistance against TRAIL/TNFSF10-induced apoptotic signaling (liao2016therolesand pages 12-13). Although broad consensus motifs for substrate recognition by CDK15 have not been firmly established, the mechanistic details are expected to share similarities with other CDKs that rely on docking interactions mediated by cyclin binding and conserved kinase domain motifs such as the DFG and HRD motifs. In the absence of detailed studies defining a full consensus sequence for CDK15 substrates, the functional data currently underscores a selective role in modifying survivin’s antiapoptotic properties rather than engaging a wide spectrum of substrates (karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 15-17, pluta2024cyclin‐dependentkinasesmasters pages 41-42).\n\n## 5. Structure  \nThe three-dimensional structure of CDK15 has not yet been determined using high-resolution crystallography; however, homology with other CDKs provides meaningful insight into its likely organization. CDK15 is expected to possess a conserved kinase domain of approximately 250 amino acids that forms a bilobal architecture typical of serine/threonine kinases. The N-terminal lobe would largely consist of β-sheets and a glycine-rich loop involved in ATP binding, while the C-terminal lobe is characterized by α-helical regions that contribute to substrate recognition and catalysis (wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 2-3, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 2-4). Conserved motifs that are hallmarks of CDK catalytic domains, such as the HRD motif in the catalytic loop and the DFG motif at the start of the activation loop, are presumed to be present in CDK15. Additionally, predictive models and sequence analysis suggest that CDK15 may harbor unique regulatory sequences—potentially an extended N-terminal region—that could influence its interactions with partner proteins, similar to other atypical CDKs within the PCTAIRE or PFTK subgroups (wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 2-3, pluta2024cyclin‐dependentkinasesmasters pages 12-14). Although experimental structural data remain scarce, these inferred features are expected to underpin both the catalytic function and regulatory controls of CDK15.\n\n## 6. Regulation  \nRegulation of CDK15, while not as comprehensively characterized as for other more canonical CDKs, appears to follow several principles common to the family. CDKs are often regulated by phosphorylation events and through interactions with cyclin proteins, which aid in substrate selection and activation. Specific to CDK15, its antiapoptotic function via survivin phosphorylation suggests that its activity must be tightly controlled within the cell. One reported mechanism involves modulation by proteasome activator complexes; for example, in breast cancer, downregulation of CDK15 by PA28α/β has been correlated with increased invasion and metastasis, suggesting that reduced CDK15 activity may contribute to tumorigenesis (ding2020therolesof pages 21-23). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation are likely to influence CDK15’s conformation and interactions, although the precise regulatory phosphorylation sites have not been explicitly mapped in the literature. In contrast to classical CDK activation, which typically depends on cyclin binding and subsequent activation loop phosphorylation by CDK-activating kinases (CAKs), the regulatory pathway for CDK15 remains less defined and is a subject of ongoing research (karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 15-17, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 6-7). Thus, while CDK15’s modulation by phosphorylation and protein-protein interactions is anticipated to be similar to its CDK counterparts, specific details—including potential cyclin partners or regulatory co-factors—await further experimental validation.\n\n## 7. Function  \nThe primary function attributed to CDK15 is its role as an antiapoptotic kinase. It achieves this by phosphorylating survivin (BIRC5) at threonine 34, an event that counterbalances apoptosis induced by the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL/TNFSF10) (liao2016therolesand pages 12-13). Survivin is a well-known inhibitor of apoptosis, and its phosphorylation at Thr34 is closely linked to enhanced cell survival mechanisms. Consequently, CDK15 is thought to contribute to the regulation of cellular apoptosis, and by extension, may influence tumor cell survival and resistance to apoptosis in certain cancer contexts (ding2020therolesof pages 21-23, pluta2024cyclin‐dependentkinasesmasters pages 41-42). Although the full spectrum of CDK15’s biological roles has not been exhaustively delineated, its antiapoptotic activity positions it as a potential modulator in both normal cellular homeostasis and disease conditions, including cancer and possibly other stress-related pathologies. Furthermore, genetic association data (as integrated by platforms such as OpenTargets) have hinted at a moderate link between CDK15 and depressive disorder, suggesting that it might play roles in neurological pathways or stress responses, although such associations require further detailed exploration (OpenTargets Search: -CDK15,PFTK2).\n\n## 8. Other Comments  \nAt present, no clinical trials have been registered that specifically target CDK15, as searches in ClinicalTrials.gov returned no interventions with CDK15, PFTK2, or ALS2CR7 in the intervention or title fields (Clinical Trials Search: AREA[InterventionName]CDK15 OR AREA[InterventionName]PFTK2 OR AREA[OfficialTitle]Cyclin-dependent kinase 15). This absence indicates that CDK15 remains largely in the domain of preclinical research. Consequently, there are no widely recognized small-molecule inhibitors or other pharmacological agents specifically developed against CDK15. Nevertheless, given its antiapoptotic function and potential involvement in cancer cell survival, CDK15 represents an attractive target for future drug discovery initiatives. In addition, the emerging genetic association with depressive disorder reinforces the need to further explore CDK15’s role in neurological processes. Notably, the overall paucity of data regarding its precise substrates, regulatory mechanisms, and structure underscores the value of continued structural, biochemical, and functional studies to define its role more clearly. Future research leveraging high-resolution structural techniques and targeted inhibitor screens could potentially yield valuable insights into the development of specific CDK15 modulators (karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 17-17, pluta2024cyclin‐dependentkinasesmasters pages 47-49).  \n\n## 9.

    "answer": "## 1. Phylogeny  \nCyclin‐dependent kinase 16 (CDK16), also known as PCTAIRE1 or PCTK1, occupies a phylogenetic niche distinct from canonical cell cycle regulators. Unlike classical CDKs that harbor the PSTAIRE motif in their αC helix, CDK16 is characterized by a non‐canonical PCTAIRE motif that plays a central role in its divergent regulation and substrate interactions (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 114-118). This replacement is not simply a point mutation; rather, it signifies a broad evolutionary adaptation that accompanies unique N‐ and C‐terminal extensions found only in this subgroup. These extensions are absent in typical cell cycle kinases such as CDK1 and CDK2, and they contribute to specialized protein–protein interactions that underlie CDK16’s function in non‐proliferative, differentiated cells.  \n   \nPhylogenetically, CDK16 is a member of the CMGC group of serine/threonine kinases—a clan that also includes mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), glycogen synthase kinases (GSKs), and several other CDK subfamilies. Within the CMGC ensemble, CDK16 is assigned to the atypical PCTAIRE subfamily, a grouping that also encompasses the closely related paralogs CDK17 and CDK18 (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 29-32). Comparative sequence analyses have established that, although CDK16 maintains a moderate level (>50%) of sequence identity with kinases such as CDK5, it diverges in its regulatory sequences and domain extensions. This divergence appears to correlate with its specialized roles in post‐mitotic tissues, including the brain and testis, where processes such as vesicle-mediated trafficking and exocytosis rather than cell proliferation are of central importance (janackova2023mechanismusregulacecyklindependentní pages 92-95).  \n   \nMoreover, orthologs of CDK16 have been identified across a diverse spectrum of metazoans, underscoring its evolutionary conservation in organisms that possess complex nervous systems and specialized secretory functions. The pattern of conservation and divergence suggests that the appearance of the PCTAIRE motif coincided with the evolution of advanced cellular functions, such as neurosecretion and the fine-tuning of vesicular dynamics. Thus, its evolutionary profile supports a scenario where CDK16 evolved from more canonical kinases to fulfill niche roles in differentiated tissues, thereby maintaining vital functions in neuronal signaling and spermatogenesis (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 29-32, janackova2023mechanismusregulacecyklindependentní pages 92-95).\n\n## 2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK16 catalyzes a phosphorylation reaction typical of serine/threonine kinases. At its core, the enzyme facilitates the transfer of the gamma-phosphate from ATP to a hydroxyl group on specific serine or threonine residues within substrate proteins. The overall chemical reaction can be represented as:  \n  ATP + [protein]–(L-serine/threonine) → ADP + [protein]–(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺  \nThis reaction mechanism is highly conserved among kinases in the CMGC family and is central to their regulatory roles in cellular signaling (golkowski2020kinobeadlcmsphosphokinomeprofiling pages 1-3).  \n   \nFor CDK16, functional studies have highlighted that one of its primary substrates is NSF (N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor), a protein critically involved in vesicle fusion events. Phosphorylation of NSF by CDK16 regulates its oligomerization, a structural reorganization necessary for the efficient docking and fusion of secretory vesicles with target membranes, thereby modulating exocytosis (dixonclarke2017structureandinhibitor pages 14-15).  \n   \nIn addition, in vitro evidence indicates that CDK16 phosphorylates cyclin Y (CCNY) at serine 336. While the full in vivo functional consequences of this modification are still being elucidated, phosphorylation of CCNY may play a role in stabilizing or modulating the assembly of the active CDK16-cyclin complex (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 32-35, karimbayli2022dissectingtherolea pages 19-22). Thus, the phosphorylation reaction catalyzed by CDK16 not only conforms to the general chemical mechanism of ATP-dependent serine/threonine kinases but also exerts specialized control over cellular processes such as vesicle-mediated transport and hormone secretion.\n\n## 3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe enzymatic activity of CDK16, like that of other serine/threonine kinases, critically depends on the presence of divalent metal ion cofactors. Magnesium (Mg²⁺) is particularly indispensable for CDK16’s catalytic efficiency. Mg²⁺ ions facilitate the correct binding and positioning of ATP within the active site by neutralizing the negative charges of the phosphate groups, thus enabling the efficient transfer of the gamma-phosphate (golkowski2020kinobeadlcmsphosphokinomeprofiling pages 1-3).  \n   \nIn typical reaction conditions, without Mg²⁺, the alignment of ATP in relation to the substrate’s serine or threonine residue is severely disrupted, leading to a marked decline in kinase activity. Although some protein kinases may employ manganese (Mn²⁺) as an alternative cofactor in vitro, there is substantial evidence to suggest that under physiological conditions, Mg²⁺ is the principal metal ion required for CDK16 function (golkowski2020kinobeadlcmsphosphokinomeprofiling pages 1-3, chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 2-4).  \n   \nNo additional cofactors or specialized regulatory small molecules have been described for CDK16 beyond the requirement for Mg²⁺. The dependence on this ion is consistent with the catalytic paradigms established for the CMGC family and underscores the similarity in the fundamental chemistry of phosphoryl transfer reactions across serine/threonine kinases.\n\n## 4. Substrate Specificity  \nCDK16 exhibits substrate specificity characteristic of CMGC family kinases, selectively phosphorylating serine/threonine residues on its target proteins. A prime example of its substrate recognition is its action on NSF. Phosphorylation of NSF by CDK16 modulates NSF oligomerization, subsequently influencing the efficiency of vesicle fusion during exocytosis processes. This modification ensures that vesicle docking occurs in a timely and spatially regulated fashion, thus supporting proper secretory function in neuronal cells and other tissues (dixonclarke2017structureandinhibitor pages 14-15, alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 114-118).  \n   \nIn addition to NSF, in vitro studies demonstrate that CDK16 can phosphorylate cyclin Y (CCNY) specifically at serine 336. Although the precise consensus sequence for CDK16 is not fully determined, its substrate recognition appears to be influenced by both linear amino acid sequences surrounding the phosphorylation site and by higher-order structural features that facilitate protein–protein docking (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 32-35, karimbayli2022dissectingtherolea pages 19-22).  \n   \nThe substrate specificity is likely governed by the unique architecture of the kinase domain, particularly by the positioning of the conserved HRD and DFG motifs, as well as by the spatial presentation of the PCTAIRE motif. This motif is considered crucial for mediating interactions with noncanonical cyclins such as cyclin Y, thereby potentially contributing to substrate selection by orienting the catalytic machinery in a precise manner (dixonclarke2017structureandinhibitor pages 1-3, chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 2-4).  \n   \nWhile a definitive consensus phosphorylation motif for CDK16 has yet to be established in the literature extracted here, it is evident from its involvement in vesicle transport and exocytosis that its substrate selection is tailored to proteins involved in membrane dynamics and intracellular signaling. The combination of linear amino acid motifs in substrates together with tertiary structural elements likely dictates the recognition process, ensuring that phosphorylation occurs only on selected serine or threonine residues that are embedded in the correct structural context.\n\n## 5. Structure  \nThe structure of CDK16 is defined by a modular organization that is reminiscent of other protein kinases but with unique features that distinguish it from the classical cell cycle CDKs. At its core, CDK16 contains a catalytic kinase domain of approximately 300 amino acids that assumes the canonical bilobal architecture. The smaller N-terminal lobe is rich in β-sheets, while the larger C-terminal lobe is predominantly composed of α-helices. Within this catalytic core, key motifs—such as the HRD motif, which is indispensable for proton transfer and catalysis, and the DFG motif, which coordinates the binding of Mg²⁺ and ATP—are conserved (dixonclarke2017structureandinhibitor pages 1-3, golkowski2020kinobeadlcmsphosphokinomeprofiling pages 1-3).  \n   \nA principal structural hallmark that sets CDK16 apart is the substitution of the classical PSTAIRE motif with a PCTAIRE motif located in the αC helix. This alteration is critical because it influences the kinase’s capacity to interact with its cyclin partners, primarily cyclin Y, and thereby modulates its activation status (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 114-118). In addition to the central kinase domain, CDK16 features distinct N- and C-terminal extensions. Although these regions are not resolved in the available crystal structures—which predominantly cover the catalytic core—they are thought to play essential regulatory roles. For instance, residues within these extensions (notably within segments spanning approximately 112–121 in the N-terminus and 461–496 in the C-terminus) have been implicated in cyclin Y binding and in modulating subcellular localization (karimbayli2022dissectingtherolea pages 19-22, kamkar2015pftaire1(cyclindependent pages 49-53).  \n   \nCrystal structure studies, predominantly focusing on the isolated kinase domain of CDK16, have revealed a degree of conformational plasticity. In complex with various inhibitors, the kinase domain can adopt distinct active or inactive conformations. Type I inhibitors, which compete with ATP, maintain the αC helix in a conformation that is compatible with active cyclin binding. In contrast, type II inhibitors tend to induce an inactive state by promoting a displacement or partial unfolding of the αC helix. Such adaptive structural features not only impact substrate recognition but also underscore the potential for the development of selective inhibitors that exploit the unique conformational dynamics of CDK16 (dixonclarke2017structureandinhibitor pages 13-14, dixonclarke2017structureandinhibitor pages 8-10).  \n   \nDespite these advances, the full-length structure of CDK16, including its regulatory N- and C-terminal regions, remains unresolved by experimental methods. Deep-learning tools like AlphaFold are likely to complement crystallographic data by providing theoretical models that hypothesize the spatial organization of the terminal extensions; these regions may harbor motifs for binding 14-3-3 proteins or additional regulatory sequences critical for allosteric modulation. Overall, the structural designation of CDK16—comprising a highly conserved catalytic core with distinct noncanonical features, such as the PCTAIRE motif and unresolved regulatory extensions—highlights its dual role as a conventional serine/threonine kinase and as a driver of specialized cellular functions.\n\n## 6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of CDK16 is orchestrated by an intricate network of protein–protein interactions and post-translational modifications that ensure its activity is precisely tuned to the cellular context. At the forefront of this regulatory scheme is the interaction with cyclin partners. Cyclin Y (CCNY) and its homolog cyclin Y-like 1 (CCNYL1) bind to CDK16, and this association is indispensable for the enzyme’s activation and proper subcellular targeting. Specific regions within CDK16, particularly segments in the N-terminal portion (approximately residues 112–121) and the C-terminal extension (around residues 461–496), are critical for mediating these interactions (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 29-32, karimbayli2022dissectingtherolea pages 19-22).  \n   \nPhosphorylation represents a key post-translational modification regulating CDK16. One extensively characterized regulatory event is the phosphorylation of CDK16 at serine 153 by protein kinase A (PKA). This modification has been shown to reduce the affinity of CDK16 for cyclin Y, thereby acting as a negative feedback mechanism that restricts the formation of the active kinase–cyclin complex (janackova2023mechanismusregulacecyklindependentní pages 12-17, karimbayli2022dissectingtherolea pages 19-22). In parallel, phosphorylation events on cyclin Y itself are critical for robust complex formation and kinase activation. For instance, phosphorylation of cyclin Y at serine 336 has been documented in vitro, and additional modifications at serine residues such as serine 100 and serine 326 (the latter possibly mediated by AMPK under conditions of autophagic stimulation) have been implicated in further stabilizing and activating the CDK16–cyclin complex (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 32-35, karimbayli2022dissectingtherolea pages 19-22).  \n   \nIn addition to phosphorylation and cyclin binding, the association with 14-3-3 adaptor proteins introduces another layer of regulation. 14-3-3 proteins typically bind phosphorylated serine/threonine motifs, and their interaction with either CDK16 or its cyclin partners can stabilize the active conformation of the kinase while also controlling subcellular localization—particularly at membranes where vesicle fusion events occur (dixonclarke2017structureandinhibitor pages 13-14, janackova2023mechanismusregulacecyklindependentní pages 92-95).  \n   \nThe conformational adaptability of the CDK16 kinase domain further contributes to its regulation. Inhibitor-binding studies have shown that the kinase domain can exist in multiple states, suggesting that allosteric mechanisms may allow the enzyme to rapidly respond to cellular signals. Such dynamic flexibility is essential in environments where rapid modulation of vesicle-mediated transport is necessary, and it may also provide a therapeutic window for the design of small molecules that target specific conformational states of CDK16. Together, these regulatory mechanisms—cyclin association, phosphorylation, 14-3-3 binding, and conformational shifting—ensure that CDK16 activity is tightly controlled to meet the precise needs of cells involved in secretion, neuronal signaling, and reproductive processes.\n\n## 7. Function  \nCDK16 is a multifunctional serine/threonine protein kinase whose activity spans a wide spectrum of biological processes. One of its major roles is in the regulation of vesicle-mediated transport and exocytosis. In neuronal contexts, CDK16 modulates the release of growth hormone 1 (GH1) by phosphorylating substrates such as NSF. The phosphorylation of NSF alters its oligomerization state, thereby directly affecting the fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane—a process that is vital for both neurotransmission and hormone secretion (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 114-118, dixonclarke2017structureandinhibitor pages 14-15).  \n   \nThe kinase's role in vesicular trafficking is not restricted to neurons; it extends to specialized secretory cells involved in insulin secretion. In pancreatic β cells, the precise control of insulin granule exocytosis is critical for metabolic homeostasis, and CDK16’s ability to phosphorylate key proteins suggests it may influence the responsiveness of these cells to fluctuating blood glucose levels (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 32-35).  \n   \nBeyond vesicle fusion, CDK16 is indispensable for normal spermatogenesis. It is highly expressed in testicular tissue, and functional disruption of CDK16 leads to impaired sperm development. This defect is thought to arise from dysregulation of vesicular transport processes that are essential during the terminal differentiation of spermatocytes into mature spermatozoa (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 114-118, karimbayli2022dissectingtheroleb pages 19-22).  \n   \nNeurodevelopment is another arena where CDK16 functions prominently. It has been implicated in neuronal differentiation and dendritic development, likely through its regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics and vesicle trafficking that underpin neurite outgrowth. Alterations in CDK16 activity have been associated with changes in dendritic branching and synaptic plasticity, further indicating its role in shaping neural circuitry and possibly affecting learning and memory (janackova2023mechanismusregulacecyklindependentní pages 92-95, karimbayli2022dissectingtherolea pages 19-22).  \n   \nIn cancer biology, emerging evidence suggests that aberrant CDK16 activity may contribute to tumorigenesis. Misregulation of its substrate phosphorylation has been linked to enhanced cell proliferation and survival. For example, experimental data indicate that CDK16 can phosphorylate proteins involved in cell cycle control and apoptosis such as TP53 and PRC1—events that may promote cytoplasmic sequestration, prevent proper nuclear localization, or destabilize inhibitors of the cell cycle. These modifications, in turn, support malignant cell proliferation and resistance to therapy (karimbayli2022dissectingtherolea pages 19-22).  \n   \nTaken together, the diverse biological roles of CDK16—ranging from vesicle-mediated exocytosis and hormone secretion in neurons to spermatogenesis and potential participation in oncogenic pathways—underscore its critical function as an integrator of signaling pathways in differentiated cells. Its evolutionary conservation and tissue-specific expression pattern further emphasize the importance of its precise regulation, ensuring that cellular processes such as neurotransmission, insulin secretion, and reproductive function proceed seamlessly.\n\n## 8. Other Comments  \nAlthough there are presently no highly selective clinical inhibitors for CDK16, current research has begun to delineate its druggability, thereby opening new therapeutic avenues. Chemical proteomic studies have demonstrated that the ATP-binding pocket of CDK16 is accessible to small molecule inhibitors that can preferentially stabilize either the active (type I) or inactive (type II) kinase conformations (dixonclarke2017structureandinhibitor pages 13-14, jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 22-24). Such compounds, by disrupting the critical interactions between CDK16 and its regulatory partners (including cyclin Y and 14-3-3 proteins), offer promising leads for future drug development.  \n   \nCDK16 has also garnered attention because of its associations with pathophysiological conditions. Altered expression or activity of CDK16 has been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, potentially through its effects on neuronal differentiation and dendritic structure, as well as to reproductive deficiencies related to its essential role in spermatogenesis. In oncology, aberrant activation of CDK16 has been reported to favor tumor cell proliferation, survival, and resistance mechanisms via improper phosphorylation of key substrates; these findings suggest that CDK16 might serve as both a biomarker and a therapeutic target in certain malignancies (karimbayli2022dissectingtheroleb pages 19-22, alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 114-118).  \n   \nCurrent research is focused on elucidating the complete structural organization of CDK16, including its currently unresolved N- and C-terminal extensions. Advanced computational approaches such as AlphaFold modeling are expected to enhance our understanding of these regions, which are likely to harbor novel regulatory motifs imperative for cyclin and 14-3-3 interactions. These insights will be critical for designing selective inhibitors that can modulate CDK16 activity with greater precision.  \n   \nFurthermore, given the central role of CDK16 in coordinating vesicle-mediated transport processes, additional studies are warranted to explore its functions in metabolic regulation, neuronal communication, and endocrine signaling. Such investigations may reveal deeper mechanistic insights and establish new links between CDK16 dysregulation and broad disease spectrums including metabolic syndromes, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer. Collectively, the body of research supporting CDK16’s multifaceted roles continues to expand, setting the stage for potential therapeutic exploitation in various clinical contexts.\n\n## 9.

    "answer": "1. Phylogeny  \nCyclin-dependent kinase 17 (CDK17), also known as PCTAIRE2, belongs to the atypical subfamily of cyclin-dependent kinases comprising CDK14–18. Phylogenetic analyses have grouped CDK17 together with CDK16 (PCTAIRE1) and CDK18 (PCTAIRE3), and these kinases are closely related to the cell cycle–related CDK5 despite their divergent regulatory features. CDK17 is evolutionarily conserved and appears to have emerged during eumetazoan evolution concomitant with the development of the nervous system; its expression is particularly noted in terminally differentiated neurons, indicating a role that is distinct from canonical cell cycle regulators (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418b pages 29-32, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 17-18). In several species, orthologs of CDK17 can be found among the PCTAIRE kinases. Its conservation even extends to early diverging metazoans, although some organisms (such as insects in particular contexts) might lack a direct CDK17 homolog, suggesting that its specialized function in neuronal differentiation may be linked to more complex nervous systems (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418c pages 29-32, karimbayli2022dissectingtherole pages 57-62). The kinome group classification places CDK17 within the CMGC group, sharing high sequence homology in its kinase domain with other serine/threonine kinases in this family. Overall, the phylogenetic context of CDK17 underscores its close evolutionary relationship with other PCTAIRE members and hints at functional specialization in differentiated, nonproliferative tissues such as the brain (karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 17-18).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK17 is a serine/threonine kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation reaction typical of cyclin-dependent kinases. The general biochemical reaction it facilitates can be described as follows: ATP + a target protein containing serine and/or threonine residues yields ADP, inorganic phosphate, and the phosphorylated target protein. Although the complete substrate repertoire of CDK17 is not yet fully elucidated, by similarity to other CDKs its activity has been associated with the phosphorylation of histone H1, suggesting its potential involvement in chromatin regulation. This reaction mechanism, which transfers the γ-phosphate from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues on protein substrates, is a canonical feature of CDK enzymes. The reaction is dependent on the proper alignment of ATP in the catalytic pocket, engagement of conserved residues such as those within the DFG and HRD motifs, and typically an induced-fit activation through cyclin binding or phosphorylation events (klenor2021rationaldesignofa pages 1-8, shah2020cdksfamilya pages 4-5).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of CDK17, like all protein kinases of the CDK family, is dependent on the binding of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as the phosphate donor. Additionally, most serine/threonine kinases require divalent metal ions as cofactors to stabilize the negative charges of ATP’s phosphate groups and to facilitate the phosphoryl transfer reaction. In the case of CDK17, Mg²⁺ is the most commonly required metal ion cofactor, ensuring proper coordination within its ATP-binding pocket. Although direct biochemical characterization of CDK17’s cofactor requirements is limited, parallels with closely related CDKs strongly support the necessity for ATP and Mg²⁺ for catalytic activity. In some cellular contexts, additional regulatory molecules may be involved—such as cyclin binding partners or regulatory proteins like 14-3-3 proteins—but the primary cofactors remain ATP and Mg²⁺ (klenor2021rationaldesignofa pages 1-8, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 2-4).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCDK17’s substrate specificity centers on its ability to phosphorylate serine/threonine residues on target proteins. One of the few identified substrates, delivered by similarity to other CDKs, is histone H1; this suggests that CDK17 may have a role in modulating chromatin structure and regulating gene expression within terminally differentiated neurons. In general, CDKs recognize substrates through specific amino acid motifs; while classical CDKs such as CDK2 favor motifs with basic residues surrounding the phosphoacceptor site, the substrate motif for CDK17 remains less clearly defined. However, the fact that CDK17 is expressed predominantly in post-mitotic neuronal cells indicates that its substrates are likely to be proteins essential for neuronal differentiation, synaptic function, or maintenance of the differentiated state. In addition, several reports have hinted that the substrate specificity of PCTAIRE kinases, in general, may rely on unique interactions mediated by their distinct N‐ and C‐terminal sequences, potentially guiding them towards substrates that are not typically recognized by the canonical PSTAIRE kinases (pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 17-18, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 17-18). At present, no consensus phosphorylation sequence specific for CDK17 has been firmly established, and further proteomic studies are required to map its full substrate spectrum.\n\n5. Structure  \nThe structural architecture of CDK17 comprises a central kinase domain that is highly conserved among CDK family members and flanked by unique N-terminal and C-terminal extensions. These terminal extensions, while less conserved than the catalytic core, are thought to contain important regulatory motifs involved in cyclin binding, subcellular targeting, and protein–protein interactions. Unlike canonical CDKs that harbor the PSTAIRE motif for cyclin recruitment, CDK17 is characterized by a PCTAIRE motif that distinguishes it both structurally and functionally from other CDKs (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418b pages 29-32, alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418d pages 29-32). Although no crystal structure of CDK17 has yet been solved, homology modeling based on the available structure of CDK16 has provided insights into its 3D conformation. The conserved kinase domain includes the characteristic glycine-rich loop, an αC-helix, and a catalytic cleft that houses key catalytic motifs such as the DFG and HRD sequences. The ATP-binding pocket is highly conserved and is presumed to exhibit similar interactions with ATP and Mg²⁺ as observed in other CDKs (karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 2-4). Moreover, the absence of extensive structural data for its regulatory regions leaves open questions regarding the precise mode of cyclin binding. Some studies suggest that while CDK17 may interact with cyclin Y, this interaction is either transient or localized to specific cellular compartments, given that its reported subcellular localization is predominantly cytoplasmic with hints of mitochondrial association in certain cell types (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418c pages 29-32, alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418d pages 32-35). The unique sequence features in the N- and C-terminal regions potentially confer specialized regulatory properties that differentiate CDK17’s activity from that of its canonical counterparts.\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of CDK17 appears to rely on multiple layers of control that are characteristic of cyclin-dependent kinases, albeit with several atypical features. A key regulatory mechanism for CDK17 likely involves binding to an activating cyclin partner. Although several PCTAIRE kinases, such as CDK16 and CDK18, are known to interact with cyclin Y and cyclin Y–like proteins, the specific cyclin partner for CDK17 has yet to be conclusively identified. In several reports, cyclin Y is implicated in the activation of related kinases, and by extension CDK17 may also use this interaction for proper activation (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418b pages 29-32, karimbayli2022dissectingtherole pages 57-62). In addition, CDK17 contains a conserved N-terminal PKA binding motif (R–R–X–S) that suggests regulation by phosphorylation events mediated by protein kinase A. Such phosphorylation may modulate its kinase activity either directly by altering conformational stability or indirectly by influencing interactions with regulatory proteins such as 14-3-3 proteins (karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 17-18). Post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation on activation loop residues, may be necessary for full catalytic activity. While the detailed identification of the phosphorylation sites remains incomplete for CDK17, the presence of conserved residues analogous to those in canonical CDKs implies that similar mechanisms—such as phosphorylation by CDK-activating kinases (CAKs) or regulatory kinases—could be operative. Finally, subcellular localization plays a crucial role in its regulation; CDK17 is predominantly cytoplasmic and has been reported to localize to mitochondria in COS7 cells, suggesting that compartmentalization may influence its accessibility to substrates and regulatory partners (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418c pages 29-32, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 7-9).\n\n7. Function  \nCDK17 is primarily expressed in terminally differentiated neurons and is associated with specialized functions in the nervous system. Its expression pattern—peaking during brain development and being predominantly found in post-mitotic neural tissues such as the hippocampus and olfactory bulbs—suggests a role in neuronal differentiation and function (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418b pages 29-32, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 7-9). One of its putative functions, inferred by similarity to other CDKs, is the phosphorylation of histone H1. This activity could implicate CDK17 in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation, thereby influencing the gene expression programs necessary for the maintenance of the differentiated state in neurons. In addition to its nuclear effects, CDK17 has been implicated in noncanonical signaling pathways that may affect vesicular trafficking and receptor-mediated signaling, especially considering its proposed roles in phosphorylation of substrates involved in endocytosis such as EPS15 and AP2 complex proteins observed in epithelial ovarian cancer models (karimbayli2022dissectingtherole pages 57-62). Such functions suggest that beyond its classical kinase activity, CDK17 might impact cellular processes related to neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity, and potentially even the cellular response to chemotherapeutic agents, as evidenced by its influence on Gefitinib sensitivity in cancer cells. Although much of its precise physiological role remains to be fully elucidated, the data currently available indicate that CDK17 participates in both chromatin-associated and cytoplasmic signaling processes, reinforcing its classification as an atypical CDK with a unique biological niche in differentiated cells (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418c pages 29-32, karimbayli2022dissectingtherolea pages 19-22).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nAs an understudied member of the CDK family, CDK17 has attracted increasing research interest due to its potential roles in both neurobiology and oncology. Notably, its predominant expression in terminally differentiated neuronal cells raises the possibility that dysregulation of CDK17 activity could contribute to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, a hypothesis that is supported by some experimental models showing increased CDK17 expression in Alzheimer’s mouse models (karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 7-9). In the context of cancer, particularly epithelial ovarian cancer, emerging evidence suggests that CDK17 may modulate cell survival and influence the efficacy of targeted therapies like EGFR inhibitors; silencing of CDK17 has been shown to sensitize cancer cells to drugs such as Gefitinib, thereby lowering the effective IC50 and potentially overcoming drug resistance mechanisms (karimbayli2022dissectingtherole pages 57-62). Additionally, while no selective inhibitors for CDK17 are currently well established, several pan-CDK inhibitors have been reported to affect PCTAIRE kinases, and structure-based design efforts continue with the aim of developing compounds that efficiently target CDK17. Furthermore, there are no widely reported disease-associated mutations or polymorphisms for CDK17 at present, which might be due to its relatively restricted expression profile and specialized biological function. Research into its interactome, particularly the identification of its regulating cyclin partner(s) and specific substrates, remains an active area of investigation that may provide further insights into its regulatory mechanisms and therapeutic potential (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418b pages 29-32, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 17-18).\n\n9.

    "answer": "1. Phylogeny  \nCyclin‐dependent kinase 18 (CDK18), also known as PCTAIRE3 or PCTK3, is phylogenetically classified as an atypical member within the broader cyclin‐dependent kinase family. Unlike classical cell cycle regulators such as CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6, CDK18 is part of the PCTAIRE subfamily that diverged evolutionarily through the replacement of the canonical PSTAIRE helix with a PCTAIRE motif. This unique substitution is present in the central catalytic domain and is known to modulate its cyclin association and regulatory properties (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 114-118). The PCTAIRE subfamily, which also comprises CDK16 (PCTAIRE1) and CDK17 (PCTAIRE2), is thought to have evolved from an ancestral CDK5-related gene, leading to a specialized group of kinases expressed predominantly in terminally differentiated cells rather than in rapidly dividing cells. Phylogenetic analyses have demonstrated that these kinases share considerable sequence similarity, particularly within their catalytic domains; however, they have acquired differences in regulatory regions that are believed to be instrumental in conferring non-cell cycle–related functions (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 29-32). Although classical CDKs are ubiquitously conserved across eukaryotes, members of the PCTAIRE subgroup, including CDK18, emerged later in the evolution of metazoans. Their orthologs have been identified in multiple mammalian species, and expression profiling indicates a tissue‐restricted pattern that frequently corresponds to cells with terminal differentiation, such as neurons, germ cells, and cells in the gastrointestinal tract (pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 1-2, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 3-5). This phylogenetic context underscores the notion that CDK18 and its related PCTAIRE kinases represent an evolutionarily derived subset of CDKs that have adapted to fulfill specialized roles in signal transduction and cellular homeostasis, rather than directly driving the proliferative cycle (karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK18 catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues on substrate proteins, a reaction that is central to its function as a signal transduction modulator in terminally differentiated cells. The chemical reaction involves the binding of ATP in the active site; coordinated by divalent metal ions, typically Mg²⁺, the kinase transfers the terminal γ-phosphate group of ATP to specific hydroxyl groups present on serine or threonine residues of the substrate proteins (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 35-38). In biochemical terms, the reaction can be summarized as follows: ATP + [protein]–(L‑serine or L‑threonine) → ADP + [protein]–(L‑serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺, consistent with the phosphoryl transfer mechanism that is a hallmark of serine/threonine kinases (chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 2-4). Although comprehensive data regarding the exact in vivo substrates remain limited, early studies suggest that CDK18 exhibits a substrate preference that may include components of vesicle trafficking, cytoskeletal regulators, and elements implicated in the maintenance of genome stability. Activation of CDK18 through cyclin binding further induces conformational changes that enhance substrate recognition and catalytic efficiency, thereby ensuring that the overall phosphorylation reaction is tightly linked to the specific signaling needs of differentiated cells (chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 22-24).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nIn order for CDK18 to achieve catalytic activity, the kinase requires the presence of essential cofactors. As with other serine/threonine kinases, the activity of CDK18 is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions, most notably magnesium (Mg²⁺), which plays a critical role in positioning the ATP molecule within the active site and stabilizing the transition state during phosphoryl group transfer (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 114-118). In addition to Mg²⁺, the binding of specific regulatory partners, especially cyclins such as cyclin A2, is integral to its proper activation. Cyclin association not only helps to align the substrate within the catalytic cleft but also contributes to the conformational rearrangements required for full catalytic competence. Multiple lines of evidence support that no non-canonical metal ions are necessary for CDK18 activity, and the protein adheres to the conventional cofactor dependencies that are common among cyclin-dependent kinases (chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 6-8).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nThe substrate specificity of CDK18, while not completely defined, appears to conform generally to the properties of serine/threonine kinases that phosphorylate residues within a certain sequence context. Early experiments and sequence alignment analyses have suggested that CDK18 tends to phosphorylate serine and threonine residues often found within a motif that may involve adjacent proline, although its specificity is somewhat relaxed in comparison with canonical cell cycle CDKs that strictly prefer a [S/T]P motif (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 114-118). Instead, CDK18’s relative flexibility in substrate recognition may allow it to target proteins involved in diverse signaling pathways, including those that regulate vesicle trafficking, cytoskeletal organization, and responses to DNA damage. This more permissive substrate specificity is thought to be partly attributable to its unique cyclin-binding characteristics; binding to cyclin A2, for instance, may induce conformational changes that expose catalytic and substrate-interaction surfaces, thereby facilitating phosphorylation of substrates that do not necessarily conform to a rigid consensus sequence (chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 22-24). Additionally, emerging evidence suggests that modulation of substrate recognition by CDK18 might also be influenced by protein–protein interactions, where accessory or scaffolding proteins help direct the kinase toward specific substrates in the cellular context (pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 17-18).\n\n5. Structure  \nThe structural organization of CDK18 is characterized by a central catalytic kinase domain that adopts the typical bilobal fold common to eukaryotic protein kinases, with a smaller N-terminal lobe predominantly composed of β-sheets and a larger C-terminal lobe mainly consisting of α-helices (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 29-32). Within this canonical kinase domain are several highly conserved motifs that are critical for the enzyme’s function. These include the VAIK motif, which is essential for proper ATP binding; the HRD motif, which plays a direct role in the catalytic mechanism; and the DFG motif, responsible for coordinating the Mg²⁺ ion that facilitates phosphoryl transfer (endicott2013structuralcharacterizationof pages 3-5). One of the defining structural features of CDK18 that sets it apart from classical CDKs is the presence of the PCTAIRE motif in lieu of the conventional PSTAIRE helix. This substitution is believed to affect both cyclin association and substrate presentation. In silico modeling and AlphaFold predictions have provided valuable insights in the absence of high-resolution crystallographic structures, confirming that CDK18 maintains the overall kinase fold yet incorporates N- and C-terminal extensions that may serve as additional regulatory docking platforms. These extensions are potentially involved in interactions with regulatory proteins such as 14-3-3, which can influence both the stability of CDK18 and its subcellular localization (karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 13-14, pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 1-2). Although experimental structural data at atomic resolution are still pending, the conservation of key catalytic residues and the overall domain architecture strongly support the notion that CDK18 shares structural features with other cyclin-dependent kinases, while its unique motif substitutions underlie its specialized regulatory functions (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 29-32, endicott2013structuralcharacterizationof pages 3-5).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of CDK18 is multifaceted, involving both post-translational modifications and specific protein–protein interactions that collectively fine-tune its catalytic activity in a context-dependent manner. A primary regulatory mechanism is the phosphorylation of key serine residues by protein kinase A (PKA). Notably, phosphorylation at Ser12 has been identified as critical for CDK18 activation; phosphomimetic mutations at this residue have been shown to significantly enhance its kinase activity even in the absence of cyclin binding (matsuda2014pctairekinase3cyclindependent pages 1-2, pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 17-18). In addition to PKA-mediated phosphorylation, CDK18 requires association with activating cyclins, with cyclin A2 being the most significant partner reported thus far. Binding of cyclin A2 induces conformational rearrangements in CDK18 that are necessary for fully aligning the active site, thus facilitating efficient substrate phosphorylation (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 32-35). Although interactions with cyclin E1 have been documented, these do not result in robust activation of the kinase, emphasizing the specificity of CDK18’s cyclin-mediated regulation (pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 17-18). Moreover, there is emerging evidence that binding to regulatory proteins such as 14-3-3 may occur in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, thereby affecting both the subcellular distribution and the stability of the CDK18 complex (karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 17-18). Collectively, these regulatory mechanisms underscore how phosphorylation, via the action of upstream kinases like PKA, and the selective interaction with cyclins, notably cyclin A2, work in concert to ensure that CDK18 activity is precisely modulated in accordance with the signaling context of terminally differentiated cells (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 32-35, matsuda2014pctairekinase3cyclindependent pages 1-2).\n\n7. Function  \nCDK18 is predominantly expressed in terminally differentiated cells, and its tissue distribution highlights a specialized role in post-mitotic signaling rather than in promoting cell proliferation. Expression analyses indicate that CDK18 levels are elevated in tissues such as the brain, testis, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract, consistent with its involvement in non-proliferative functions (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 16-26, pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 1-2). Functionally, CDK18 has been implicated in several key cellular processes. One of its notable roles is in maintaining genome integrity; experimental depletion of CDK18 leads to increased DNA damage and replication fork stalling, suggesting that it plays a part in the DNA damage response and in preserving genomic stability (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 35-38). In addition, CDK18 appears to participate in the regulation of vesicle trafficking by modulating COPII-mediated transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus—a critical process for ensuring proper protein secretion and membrane localization (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 35-38). Beyond these functions, there is evidence that CDK18 influences actin cytoskeletal dynamics. Its activity can indirectly alter cell morphology and adhesion by affecting signaling pathways that control actin polymerization, processes particularly relevant in the context of differentiated cells that require specialized cytoskeletal remodeling for proper function (chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 6-8). Moreover, aberrant expression and deregulation of CDK18 have been linked to oncogenic signaling pathways—for instance, through modulation of MYC and E2F target gene expression—although its precise role in tumorigenesis may vary depending on cellular context, with some studies suggesting potential tumor suppressive aspects in certain settings (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 16-26, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 17-17). Collectively, these functional data present CDK18 as a versatile kinase that integrates signals from multiple pathways, contributing to genome maintenance, vesicle trafficking, and cytoskeletal regulation, which together underscore its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis in terminally differentiated cells (chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 6-8, pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 14-16).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nDespite the growing recognition of CDK18’s biological importance, selective targeting of this kinase has proven challenging. The design of potent inhibitors is complicated by the atypical configuration of its cyclin-binding region, characterized by the PCTAIRE motif, which differentiates it structurally from classical CDKs and contributes to its relaxed substrate specificity (pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 1-2, alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 16-26). As a result, pan-CDK inhibitors have been unable to achieve the high degree of selectivity that would allow for the dissection of CDK18-specific functions in physiological and pathological conditions. This has spurred interest in alternative approaches, such as the development of peptide inhibitors designed to disrupt key protein–protein interactions or the application of proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) to induce selective degradation of CDK18 (pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 1-2). Furthermore, ongoing research is focused on elucidating the regulatory interplay between CDK18 and its activating partners—particularly cyclin A2—and the post-translational modifications mediated by PKA, which may reveal novel structural features that can be exploited for drug design (matsuda2014pctairekinase3cyclindependent pages 1-2, pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 17-18). Disease associations have emerged from recent studies; for example, dysregulated CDK18 expression has been correlated with hepatocellular carcinoma as well as neurodegenerative disorders, notably Alzheimer’s disease, where misregulation of cell cycle–related signaling in post-mitotic neurons may contribute to disease progression (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 35-38, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 17-18). Although these associations are largely correlative at this stage, they highlight the potential of CDK18 as a therapeutic target and emphasize the need for further mechanistic studies to fully understand its role in both normal physiology and disease pathology. Overall, CDK18 exemplifies an understudied yet promising kinase whose unique regulatory and functional properties necessitate additional in-depth investigation to harness its potential in precision medicine (pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 1-2, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 1-2).\n\n9.

    "answer": "1. Phylogeny  \nCyclin‐dependent kinase 20 (CDK20), also referred to as cell cycle–related kinase (CCRK), CDK‐activating kinase p42, cell division protein kinase 20, cyclin‐dependent protein kinase H, or cyclin–kinase–activating kinase p42, belongs to the cyclin-dependent kinase family that is classified within the CMGC group of serine/threonine protein kinases, an evolutionarily conserved lineage that includes both classical cell cycle regulators (such as CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6) and more atypical members involved in transcriptional and developmental regulation (chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 10-12, alexander2021theconciseguide pages 65-67).  \nPhylogenetic studies indicate that CDK20 has orthologs conserved across a broad range of metazoan species, underscoring its essential roles in regulating cell proliferation and neural development through conserved catalytic and regulatory domains (łukasik2021cyclindependentkinases(cdk) pages 1-2, pluta2024cyclin‐dependentkinasesmasters pages 1-3).  \nIts placement within the CMGC kinome highlights the shared ancestry with other kinases that possess a highly conserved bilobal catalytic domain, with ancestral roots that may extend back to the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) (chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 4-6, alexanderUnknownyeartheconciseguide pages 4-5).  \nThe evolutionary conservation of CDK20’s catalytic core and regulatory motifs reflects its indispensable function in orchestrating both cell cycle transitions and key developmental signaling pathways, including those involved in neural tube patterning (chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 2-4, pluta2024cyclin‐dependentkinasesmasters pages 12-14).  \nTaken together, these findings place CDK20 among an ancient and critical subgroup of CDKs that integrate cell cycle control with specialized functions in ciliary assembly and developmental processes (chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 21-22, alexander2021theconciseguide pages 65-67).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK20 catalyzes a phosphorylation reaction characteristic of serine/threonine kinases, where it transfers the γ-phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl side-chain of serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins (chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 10-12, tadesse2018cyclindependentkinase2 pages 4-8).  \nSpecifically, one of its best-characterized reactions is the phosphorylation of CDK2 at threonine-160 within the activation loop, a post-translational modification that is critical to converting CDK2 from an inactive to an active state, thereby promoting cell cycle progression through the G1/S phase transition (mullerdott2025fromactivityinference pages 48-52, alexander2021theconciseguide pages 65-67).  \nThe overall reaction can be represented as: ATP + protein–OH → ADP + protein–O–PO₃²⁻ + H⁺, a reaction fundamental not only to the modulation of cell cycle regulators but also to the maintenance of proper signal transduction events (chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 2-4, tadesse2018cyclindependentkinase2 pages 4-8).  \nIn addition to its role in directly activating CDK2, CDK20 is also implicated in modulating the assembly of the primary cilium by phosphorylating or regulating other substrates in complex with regulatory proteins such as TBC1D32, thereby indirectly impacting the activation state of transcription factors like GLI2 in response to Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling (chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 22-24, flax2024illuminationofunderstudied pages 2-3).  \nThus, the biochemical reaction mediated by CDK20 extends its impact from the control of cell proliferation to the regulation of key developmental signaling cascades through precise phosphorylation events (alexander2021theconciseguide pages 65-67, tadesse2018cyclindependentkinase2 pages 4-8).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of CDK20, similar to other members of the CMGC kinase family, is critically dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions for its catalytic function (chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 10-12, łukasik2021cyclindependentkinases(cdk) pages 1-2).  \nMagnesium ions (Mg²⁺) serve as the primary cofactor, playing an essential role in coordinating ATP within the active site and stabilizing the transition state during the phosphoryl transfer reaction (chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 10-12, alexander2021theconciseguide pages 65-67).  \nThis requirement for Mg²⁺ not only facilitates the efficient binding and proper orientation of ATP but also neutralizes the negative charges of the phosphate groups, thereby ensuring maximal catalytic proficiency under physiological conditions (chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 10-12, łukasik2021cyclindependentkinases(cdk) pages 1-2).  \nNo additional unique cofactors or regulatory molecules, beyond what is typically observed in serine/threonine kinases, have been reported for CDK20, emphasizing the conserved nature of its biochemical mechanism within the CDK family (chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 10-12, alexander2021theconciseguide pages 65-67).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCDK20 exhibits substrate specificity that is defined primarily by its role in phosphorylating CDK2 at the critical threonine-160 residue, a modification that is essential for the activation of CDK2 and subsequent cell cycle progression (chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 10-12, tadesse2018cyclindependentkinase2 pages 4-8).  \nWhile the exact consensus motif for CDK20 is not fully characterized, its substrate recognition is consistent with the behavior of other cyclin-dependent kinases, which often prefer serine/threonine residues situated within structural contexts that may include proline-directed motifs or adjacent regulatory sequence elements (pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 2-4, wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 21-22).  \nIn addition to directly phosphorylating CDK2, there is evidence suggesting that CDK20 contributes to the regulation of primary cilium assembly through its interaction with TBC1D32, implying that it may target other substrates involved in the structural organization of the cilium, which in turn affect downstream effectors such as GLI2 in Shh signaling (chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 22-24, flax2024illuminationofunderstudied pages 2-3).  \nThus, CDK20 likely recognizes substrates that possess structural features analogous to those found in classical CDK targets, with substrate specificity modulated by its interactions with cyclins or cyclin-like partners, even though the precise amino acid motif remains to be comprehensively mapped (pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 2-4, wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 21-22).\n\n5. Structure  \nThe overall structure of CDK20 is dictated by its conserved serine/threonine kinase domain, which adheres to the typical bilobal architecture observed among cyclin-dependent kinases (chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 10-12, wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2).  \nThe N-terminal lobe is generally composed of a series of β-sheets along with an important αC-helix that undergoes conformational rearrangement upon cyclin binding, thereby playing a pivotal role in the activation process (leopold2018optogeneticallycontrolledprotein pages 3-4, alexander2021theconciseguide pages 65-67).  \nIn contrast, the larger C-terminal lobe houses critical catalytic motifs including the ATP-binding pocket as well as regions responsible for substrate recognition; within this lobe, conserved motifs such as the DFG (Asp-Phe-Gly) and HRD (His-Arg-Asp) sequences are central to catalysis and are preserved in CDK20 (chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 10-12, pluta2024cyclin‐dependentkinasesmasters pages 12-14).  \nDespite the absence of high-resolution crystallographic data specifically for CDK20, homology models and AlphaFold predictions support a structural organization that is similar to that of other CDKs, with potential additional N- and C-terminal extensions that may mediate interactions with regulatory proteins involved in ciliary assembly, such as TBC1D32 (wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2, leopold2018optogeneticallycontrolledprotein pages 4-6).  \nThese extended regions, while less well conserved than the central kinase domain, are hypothesized to confer unique regulatory properties that link the classical kinase activity with specialized roles in developmental signaling and primary cilium organization (chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 6-8, pluta2024cyclin‐dependentkinasesmasters pages 12-14).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulatory mechanisms controlling CDK20 are multifaceted and closely mirror those observed amongst cyclin-dependent kinases (chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 6-8, tadesse2018cyclindependentkinase2 pages 4-8).  \nA central regulatory event is the phosphorylation-dependent activation, which, in the case of CDK20, is exemplified by its ability to phosphorylate CDK2 on threonine-160; this phosphorylation event is essential for inducing the conformational changes that yield an active CDK2 capable of driving cell cycle progression (mullerdott2025fromactivityinference pages 48-52, alexander2021theconciseguide pages 65-67).  \nIn addition to this critical activity, CDK20 is regulated through its physical interaction with specific binding partners—most notably TBC1D32—which is believed to facilitate its localization to the primary cilium, thereby integrating its catalytic function with developmental signaling processes (chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 22-24, flax2024illuminationofunderstudied pages 1-2).  \nMoreover, as is typical for CDKs, post-translational modifications such as additional phosphorylation events (possibly at sites outside the catalytic loop) may modulate its kinase activity, subcellular distribution, and interactions with other regulatory proteins, though the complete mapping of these modifications for CDK20 remains an area of active investigation (chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 6-8, janackova2023mechanismusregulacecyklindependentní pages 20-24).  \nTogether, these regulation processes underscore the temporal and spatial control of CDK20 activity, ensuring its function is tightly coordinated with both cell cycle progression and ciliary-mediated developmental signaling (flax2024illuminationofunderstudied pages 6-7, ettl2022therenaissanceof pages 1-2).\n\n7. Function  \nCDK20 exhibits a dual functionality that is central to both the control of cell proliferation and the regulation of developmental signaling pathways (chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 10-12, pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 2-4).  \nIts most well-established role is the activation of CDK2 via phosphorylation of threonine-160, a modification critical for the progression of the cell cycle, particularly at the G1/S transition, thereby ensuring proper cell growth and division (tadesse2018cyclindependentkinase2 pages 4-8, alexander2021theconciseguide pages 65-67).  \nIn parallel, CDK20 is indispensable for mediating high-level Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling responses during neural development; it achieves this by cooperating with TBC1D32 to regulate the structure of the primary cilium, an organelle that is essential for the activation of GLI2, a transcription factor pivotal to the orchestration of neural tube patterning (chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 22-24, flax2024illuminationofunderstudied pages 2-3).  \nBy coordinating the assembly of the ciliary membrane and axoneme, CDK20 effectively integrates mitogenic signals with developmental cues, linking the activation status of CDK2 to broader cellular programs that govern tissue differentiation and organogenesis (mullerdott2025fromactivityinference pages 48-52, pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 18-19).  \nFurthermore, aberrant expression of CDK20 has been associated with oncogenic processes in various tumor types, indicating that its dysregulated activity may not only promote uncontrolled cell proliferation but also contribute to developmental abnormalities and cancer progression (pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 54-55, southekal2021integrativeanalysisof pages 19-25).  \nThus, CDK20 functions as a key signaling hub that connects the regulation of the cell cycle with intricate developmental pathways, making it a subject of considerable interest in both basic biology and translational research aimed at cancer therapeutics (chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 10-12, pluta2024cyclin‐dependentkinasesmasters pages 12-14).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nDespite the significant roles played by CDK20 in the regulation of cell division and developmental signaling, it remains relatively underexplored compared to more thoroughly characterized CDKs, and there is currently a scarcity of specific inhibitors that directly target this kinase (flax2024illuminationofunderstudied pages 6-7, ettl2022therenaissanceof pages 1-2).  \nRecent studies have begun to emphasize CDK20’s potential as an oncogenic driver in various cancers, with overexpression correlating with increased cell proliferation and poor clinical outcomes, thereby positioning it as a promising candidate for therapeutic intervention in oncological settings (pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 56-56, southekal2021integrativeanalysisof pages 19-25).  \nThe interplay between CDK20 and developmental signals, particularly through its modulation of primary cilium structure and Shh signaling, may also have important implications in understanding congenital neurological disorders and other developmental maladies (chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 22-24, leopold2018optogeneticallycontrolledprotein pages 4-6).  \nFurthermore, advanced computational approaches such as AlphaFold-based structural predictions are now being harnessed to gain deeper insights into the structural dynamics of CDK20, which could eventually facilitate the design of novel, highly selective inhibitors (wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 21-22, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 15-17).  \nOngoing research efforts are focused on mapping the full spectrum of post-translational modifications on CDK20 and characterizing its interactions with potential cyclin partners, with the aim of elucidating the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying its regulation and function in both normal and pathological contexts (chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 6-8, janackova2023mechanismusregulacecyklindependentní pages 20-24).\n\n9.

    "answer": "1. Phylogeny  \nFructosamine-3-kinase (FN3K) is an evolutionarily conserved enzyme found in all domains of life, ranging from bacteria to lower eukaryotes and complex mammals. In prokaryotes and simple eukaryotes, a single FN3K gene is typically present, whereas in tetrapods two homologs exist – FN3K and the FN3K-related protein (FN3K-RP) – a divergence that arose from independent gene duplication events in the reptilian/bird and placental mammal lineages (shrestha2023elucidatingtheunderstudied pages 27-32). FN3K belongs to the protein kinase-like (PKL) fold superfamily and is most closely related to a subset of eukaryotic-like kinases (ELKs) that phosphorylate small molecule substrates, rather than the classical eukaryotic protein kinases (EPKs) known for phosphorylating serine/threonine or tyrosine residues (avemaria2015possibleroleof pages 1-2). Across species, orthologs of FN3K have been identified in mammals, birds, amphibians, and fishes, with notable conservation of key catalytic and regulatory motifs; however, some organisms (for instance, yeasts and arthropods) appear to lack a canonical FN3K ortholog (shrestha2023elucidatingtheunderstudied pages 65-71). In phylogenetic reconstructions, FN3K clusters within a core set of kinases that trace back to the Last Common Eukaryotic Ancestor, highlighting its ancient and indispensable role in cellular homeostasis (beeraka2021thetamingof pages 12-14).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nFN3K catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of fructosamines, which are sugar–protein adducts typically formed when reducing sugars such as glucose or ribose nonenzymatically react with lysine residues in proteins. More specifically, the enzyme transfers the γ-phosphate from ATP to the 3’-hydroxyl group of the fructosamine moiety, thereby generating a fructosamine-3-phosphate derivative (beisswenger2001humanfructosamine3kinasepurification pages 1-2). This phosphorylated intermediate is intrinsically unstable and rapidly decomposes via elimination, resulting in the removal of the glycation adduct and the regeneration of the native, unmodified lysine residue (avemaria2015possibleroleof pages 1-2). In addition to its primary substrate, FN3K is capable of phosphorylating related compounds such as psicosamines and ribulosamines, which suggests a broader substrate repertoire among orthologs, particularly in mammals (garg2025themolecularbasis pages 1-2). The overall reaction can be summarized as: ATP + glycation-modified protein → ADP + phosphorylated glycation (which then degrades) + H⁺, a reaction mechanism that mitigates the formation of Advanced Glycation End products (AGEs) implicated in diabetic complications (beisswenger2001humanfructosamine3kinasepurification pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of FN3K is strictly dependent on ATP, which serves as the phosphate donor during the phosphorylation reaction (garg2025themolecularbasis pages 1-2). In addition, divalent metal ions—most notably Mg²⁺—are essential cofactors that facilitate proper ATP binding and catalysis by stabilizing the transition state and the nucleotide substrate (shrestha2023elucidatingtheunderstudiedc pages 121-126). Some studies have also suggested that FN3K might interact with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) compounds in a metal- and concentration-dependent manner, hinting at a potential regulatory cross-talk with cellular redox pathways (shrestha2023elucidatingtheunderstudied pages 90-95). Thus, the core cofactor requirements for optimal FN3K activity are ATP and Mg²⁺, with additional modulation by NAD-related metabolites providing an intricate link between deglycation and redox homeostasis (garg2025themolecularbasis pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nFN3K exhibits a high substrate specificity for fructosamine adducts, preferentially targeting sugar moieties attached to lysine residues on proteins. The physiological substrates of FN3K are primarily fructoselysine residues that result from the nonenzymatic glycation of proteins, especially prevalent in long-lived proteins found in erythrocytes, the lens, and brain tissues (avemaria2015possibleroleof pages 1-2). Additionally, several studies indicate that FN3K can phosphorylate structurally related glycation adducts such as psicosamines and ribulosamines, suggesting that it plays a broader role in protein deglycation beyond a single substrate type (garg2025themolecularbasis pages 1-2). Although a consensus substrate motif has not been conclusively defined as in some other kinases, the selective recognition appears to be driven by the structural configuration of the glycated lysine side chain and the attached sugar moiety, which is optimally positioned for phosphorylation at the 3′ position (beisswenger2001humanfructosamine3kinasepurification pages 1-2).\n\n5. Structure  \nFN3K possesses a catalytic domain that adheres to the canonical protein kinase-like (PKL) fold, comprising a smaller N-terminal lobe predominantly composed of β-strands and a larger C-terminal lobe enriched in α-helices. Structural studies, including the crystal structure of Arabidopsis thaliana FN3K (AtFN3K) and homology models of the human enzyme, reveal that FN3K is a monomeric kinase of approximately 309 amino acids in humans (avemaria2015possibleroleof pages 1-2, shrestha2023elucidatingtheunderstudiedc pages 1-13). A uniquely defining structural feature of FN3K is the presence of a highly conserved cysteine residue located in the ATP-binding P-loop; in plant FN3K, this cysteine participates in the formation of an interchain disulfide bond that stabilizes a strand-exchange dimer, a redox-active switch that modulates enzymatic activity (shrestha2020aredoxactiveswitch pages 1-1, shrestha2023elucidatingtheunderstudied pages 13-17). Although human FN3K is typically described as monomeric, the equivalent P-loop cysteine confers redox sensitivity that can potentially influence its conformation and activity (garg2025themolecularbasis pages 8-10, shrestha2023elucidatingtheunderstudied pages 65-71). Overall, the central kinase domain is the primary structural element, with flanking regions being less conserved and possibly involved in substrate recognition or interaction with regulatory proteins (beisswenger2001humanfructosamine3kinasepurification pages 1-2).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of FN3K is multifaceted and involves both cofactor interactions and redox-dependent mechanisms. A pivotal regulatory mechanism is mediated by the conserved P-loop cysteine, which serves as a redox-active switch; reversible formation of disulfide bonds involving this cysteine modulates FN3K dimerization and catalytic activity (shrestha2020aredoxactiveswitch pages 1-1, shrestha2023elucidatingtheunderstudied pages 13-17). In human FN3K, alterations in the cellular redox environment can change the oxidation state of this cysteine residue, thereby affecting enzyme activity; for instance, oxidative conditions may promote disulfide bond formation, leading to changes in conformation that could either inhibit or alter substrate specificity (garg2025themolecularbasis pages 8-10, shrestha2023elucidatingtheunderstudied pages 65-71). Although post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation have not been extensively detailed for FN3K, the enzyme’s activity is further modulated by its interaction with cofactors like ATP and possibly NAD derivatives, linking its regulation to cellular energy and redox status (shrestha2023elucidatingtheunderstudiedc pages 121-126). Thus, FN3K regulation is achieved through a combination of redox state modulation, nucleotide binding, and potentially interactions with other cellular metabolites that fine-tune its deglycation function (avemaria2015possibleroleof pages 1-2).\n\n7. Function  \nThe principal function of FN3K is to safeguard protein integrity by catalyzing the deglycation of proteins that have been modified by non-enzymatic glycation with reducing sugars. By phosphorylating fructoselysine residues on glycated proteins, FN3K initiates a reaction that leads to the spontaneous decomposition of the fructosamine adduct, thereby restoring protein function and preventing the accumulation of Advanced Glycation End products (AGEs) (avemaria2015possibleroleof pages 1-2, beisswenger2001humanfructosamine3kinasepurification pages 1-2). In addition to its role in protein repair, emerging research suggests that FN3K is involved in the cellular response to oxidative stress; for example, deglycation of key regulatory proteins such as NFE2L2/NRF2 by FN3K facilitates proper transcriptional responses against oxidative damage (garg2025themolecularbasis pages 1-2). FN3K is expressed in tissues with proteins of long half-life, such as erythrocytes, the lens, and the brain, where the prevention of glycation-induced damage is critical for maintaining cellular function (avemaria2015possibleroleof pages 1-2). Moreover, in pathological contexts like diabetes, polymorphisms within the FN3K gene have been associated with altered glycation levels, implicating the enzyme in diabetic complications and metabolic dysregulation (shrestha2023elucidatingtheunderstudied pages 121-126). This deglycation process is not only critical for protein quality control but also influences cellular metabolism and redox homeostasis, thereby impacting processes such as cell signaling, gene expression, and even oncogenic pathways (garg2025themolecularbasis pages 1-2).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nWhile no specific small molecule inhibitors have been firmly established for FN3K, its classification as a kinase with a unique redox-regulated active site makes it a promising target for therapeutic intervention, particularly in conditions related to diabetic complications and oxidative stress (shrestha2023elucidatingtheunderstudied pages 90-95). Clinical research suggests that variations in FN3K activity, due in part to genetic polymorphisms, correlate with glycation levels and HbA1c values, and thereby may influence disease onset and progression in diabetes (avemaria2015possibleroleof pages 1-2, beisswenger2001humanfructosamine3kinasepurification pages 1-2). Current studies are also exploring the possibility that FN3K’s deglycation activity modulates the function of key transcription factors such as NRF2, suggesting further implications in cancer biology and cellular stress responses (garg2025themolecularbasis pages 8-10, shrestha2020aredoxactiveswitch pages 1-1). Ongoing research is focused on characterizing novel inhibitors that can selectively modulate FN3K activity without affecting the broader kinase network, an endeavor that draws on structural insights such as the unique disulfide-mediated redox switch in the P-loop (shrestha2023elucidatingtheunderstudied pages 13-17). Additionally, several mutagenesis studies have highlighted that substitutions at key catalytic residues can significantly impair enzymatic function, thereby establishing critical regions for further drug design efforts (shrestha2023elucidatingtheunderstudiedd pages 13-17). Overall, FN3K remains an active area of research with its function bridging protein repair, metabolic regulation, and redox balance, and future discoveries may yield therapeutic agents to manage glycation-associated disorders.\n\n9.

    "answer": "1. Phylogeny  \nBRSK1 (also known as SAD-B) is a member of the AMPK‐related kinase (ARK) family that encompasses 14 evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine kinases. Within the kinome, BRSK1 belongs to the CAMKL subgroup and shows a high degree of conservation among vertebrates. Comparative phylogenetic analyses reveal that key cysteine residues that mediate redox regulation in BRSK1 are preserved across species, underscoring their adaptive importance in neuronal signaling contexts (bendzunas2024redoxregulationof pages 15-18, bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 2-3). In particular, the unique substitution in the canonical APE motif—where an alanine is replaced by a cysteine (yielding a “CPE” motif)—appears to represent an evolutionarily restricted adaptation found in brain‐selective kinases, with almost no equivalents found among other eukaryotic protein kinases outside this subgroup (bendzunas2024redoxregulationof pages 26-30, bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 15-17). Moreover, the close paralog BRSK2 shares approximately 95% identity in its kinase domain with BRSK1, and both orthologs are traceable back to a common ancestral gene present in the early metazoans, indicating that these kinases form part of an evolutionarily ancient signaling module critical for neuronal polarity and cellular metabolic regulation (bendzunas2024redoxregulationof pages 37-45, bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 19-21).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nBRSK1 functions as a serine/threonine-protein kinase that catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to specific serine or threonine residues on target substrate proteins. The general chemical reaction catalyzed by BRSK1 can be summarized as:  \n  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(phospho-L-serine/threonine) + H⁺  \nThis phosphorylation event is critical for modifying the activity, localization, or interaction potential of substrates involved in neuronal polarization, centrosome duplication, and cell cycle regulation (bendzunas2024redoxregulationof pages 51-58). Specifically, BRSK1 phosphorylates substrates such as MAPT/TAU, CDC25B, CDC25C, WEE1, RIMS1, and gamma-tubulin isoforms (TUBG1 and TUBG2). Each phosphorylation event contributes to a distinct cellular process; for example, phosphorylation of MAPT/TAU modulates microtubule dynamics in neurons, while phosphorylation of CDC25 phosphatases and WEE1 impacts cell cycle checkpoints and centrosome function (bendzunas2024redoxregulationof pages 58-65, kamireddy2020aquantitativephosphoproteomics pages 37-42).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nAs with most protein kinases, the catalytic activity of BRSK1 depends on the presence of magnesium ions. Mg²⁺ acts as a crucial cofactor by facilitating the coordination of the ATP molecule within the active site, thereby stabilizing the transition state during the phosphoryl transfer (bendzunas2024redoxregulationof pages 51-58). Additionally, ATP is required as the phosphate donor in the phosphorylation reaction. While specific studies regarding potential accessory cofactors beyond Mg²⁺ and ATP are limited in the current context, the known dependency mirrors that of other serine/threonine kinases belonging to the AMPK-related kinase family (bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 2-3).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nBRSK1 demonstrates specificity for substrates that play key roles in neuronal structure and cell cycle regulation. Known physiological substrates include:  \n • MAPT/TAU, where phosphorylation at residues such as Thr-529 and Ser-579 influences microtubule stability and neuronal polarity;  \n • CDC25B and CDC25C, whose phosphorylation leads to their inhibition and consequent checkpoint regulation;  \n • WEE1, where phosphorylation at Ser-642 downregulates its activity, thereby influencing the transition to a polarized neuronal state;  \n • RIMS1, which is implicated in the regulation of neurotransmitter release through phosphorylation;  \n • Gamma-tubulin isoforms (TUBG1 and TUBG2), with phosphorylation at Ser-131 promoting the recruitment of gamma-tubulin complexes to the centrosome (bendzunas2024redoxregulationof pages 15-18, bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 17-18).  \nThe kinase appears to target sequences within its substrates that either conform to a modest consensus or are defined by the structural context provided by their interaction interfaces. Although an explicit consensus substrate motif has not been delineated in the provided context, the substrates often contain regulatory serine/threonine residues positioned in regions that are accessible for phosphorylation following conformational changes induced by upstream regulatory signals (tamir2020gainoffunctiongeneticscreen pages 8-9).\n\n5. Structure  \nBRSK1 is characterized by a modular domain architecture typical of AMPK-related kinases. The primary structure includes an N-terminal serine/threonine kinase catalytic domain, which spans approximately residues 29 to 358. This domain is responsible for the catalytic activity and contains several highly conserved motifs, including the HRD motif in the catalytic loop, the DFG motif for ATP binding, and an activation loop (T-loop) that requires phosphorylation by LKB1 for full enzymatic activity (bendzunas2024redoxregulationof pages 51-58, bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 3-5).  \nDownstream of the kinase domain, BRSK1 contains additional regulatory domains:  \n • A ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain, which may participate in protein–protein interactions and potentially regulate substrate recognition;  \n • A proline-rich region (PRR) that could provide docking sites for SH3 domain-containing proteins;  \n • A kinase-associated domain (KA1) that is sometimes implicated in autoinhibitory interactions and subcellular localization.  \nOne of the unique structural features of BRSK1, as compared with other eukaryotic protein kinases, is the presence of redox-sensitive cysteine residues. Mass spectrometric analyses have confirmed the formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds between cysteine pairs C147-C153 and C191-C198 within the kinase domain. These bonds are strategically positioned near key regulatory motifs: the C147-C153 pair links the HRD motif region to neighboring structural elements, while the C191-C198 pair involves a T-loop +2 cysteine that forms a disulfide with a cysteine in the uniquely configured CPE (replacing the canonical APE) motif (bendzunas2024redoxregulationof pages 15-18, bendzunas2024redoxregulationof pages 3-7).  \nStructural modeling using AlphaFold and molecular dynamics simulations support the notion that these disulfide bonds are not only critical for maintaining structural stability but also serve as reversible switches that regulate kinase activity in response to redox conditions in the cell (bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 14-15, bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 7-9). Although high-resolution crystallographic data for BRSK1 are not yet available, the integration of proteomic, biochemical, and computational data has provided a robust model for understanding the domain organization and redox regulation of BRSK1’s catalytic core (bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 3-5, koduri2024proteinkinasec pages 1-8).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe activity of BRSK1 is controlled by a combination of phosphorylation-dependent and redox-sensitive mechanisms. Full activation of BRSK1 requires phosphorylation at a conserved threonine residue within the activation loop by the upstream kinase LKB1, which is a master regulator of AMPK-related kinases (bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 2-3, kamireddy2020aquantitativephosphoproteomics pages 37-42). This LKB1-mediated phosphorylation primes BRSK1 for substrate phosphorylation and is a critical regulatory step that can be modulated by other cellular signals.  \nIn parallel to phosphorylation, BRSK1 is subject to regulation via cysteine-based redox modifications. Distinct cysteine residues in the kinase domain, notably within the T-loop and proximal to the HRD catalytic motif, undergo reversible oxidation-reduction cycles. The oxidation leads to the formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds (e.g., C147-C153 and C191-C198) that can either inhibit or modulate catalytic activity based on the redox state of the cell (bendzunas2024redoxregulationof pages 15-18, bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 14-15). Experimental data have shown that treatment with reducing agents such as dithiothreitol (DTT) can reverse the inhibitory effects of oxidative stress, thereby reactivating kinase function. Conversely, oxidizing agents like hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) inhibit BRSK1 activity by promoting disulfide bond formation and other oxidative modifications such as glutathionylation (bendzunas2024redoxregulationof pages 51-58, bendzunas2024redoxregulationof pages 58-65).  \nThus, BRSK1 exhibits a dual-layer regulation: phosphorylation by LKB1 establishes an “on” state, while the redox state fine-tunes activity via covalent oxidation of specific cysteine residues. This redox control may serve as a protective mechanism against hyperactivation under conditions of oxidative stress and may also rapidly relay changes in cellular metabolism into adjustments of kinase activity (bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 15-17, bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 19-21).\n\n7. Function  \nBRSK1 plays several critical roles in neuronal cellular physiology and cell cycle regulation. Its brain-selective expression underlines its importance in neurodevelopment and maintenance of neuronal polarity. In cortical neurons, BRSK1 is involved in the polarization process by phosphorylating substrates such as MAPT/TAU at key residues (Thr-529 and Ser-579), which modulate microtubule dynamics and contribute to the development of the neuronal axon–dendrite axis (bendzunas2024redoxregulationof pages 15-18, bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 17-18).  \nMoreover, BRSK1 regulates centrosome duplication through the phosphorylation of gamma-tubulin isoforms (TUBG1 and TUBG2) at Ser-131. Phosphorylation of gamma-tubulin facilitates its translocation and assembly at the centrosome, thus promoting proper centrosome duplication and ensuring genomic stability during cell division (bendzunas2024redoxregulationof pages 58-65, bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 25-26).  \nIn addition to these functions, BRSK1 modulates cell cycle progression by phosphorylating cell cycle regulatory proteins such as CDC25B and CDC25C. By inhibiting these phosphatases, BRSK1 indirectly suppresses the activity of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), which is crucial for the transition from G2 to M phase. Along with phosphorylating WEE1 at Ser-642 to downregulate its inhibitory effects, BRSK1 helps integrate signals from DNA damage checkpoints, particularly in the context of UV-induced responses where it contributes to cell cycle arrest (bendzunas2024redoxregulationof pages 51-58, koduri2024proteinkinasec pages 13-21).  \nBeyond its role in cell cycle control, BRSK1 is implicated in neurotransmitter release through the phosphorylation of RIMS1, a key component of the presynaptic release machinery. By modulating RIMS1 activity, BRSK1 may influence synaptic vesicle dynamics and neurotransmission, thus exerting a direct effect on overall neuronal communication and network stability (koduri2024proteinkinasec pages 1-8, tamir2020gainoffunctiongeneticscreen pages 8-9).  \nOverall, BRSK1 functions as an integrator of signaling pathways involved in neuronal polarity, centrosome duplication, and cell cycle regulation, acting both through direct phosphorylation of structural proteins and via modulation of post-translational modifications that alter enzymatic activity in response to redox changes (bendzunas2024redoxregulationof pages 15-18, bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 19-21).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nEmerging evidence indicates that the redox-sensitive regulation of BRSK1, mediated by conserved cysteine residues, is a promising target for therapeutic intervention in neurological disorders where oxidative stress is implicated. While direct inhibitors specifically targeting BRSK1 have yet to be comprehensively developed, the study of its redox regulation provides potential avenues for pharmacological modulation. For example, compounds that selectively modulate the redox state of the kinase domain may restore or inhibit activity depending on the disease context (bendzunas2024redoxregulationof pages 26-30, bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 25-26).  \nFurthermore, alterations in BRSK1 activity, whether through mutations in critical redox-regulatory cysteines or aberrant upstream activation by LKB1, may contribute to pathogenic processes in both neurodegeneration and cancer. Mutations that mimic constitutive oxidation or prevent proper disulfide formation could lead to either hyperactivation or inactivation, respectively, thus disrupting normal signaling cascades. Current research is actively exploring these mutation effects and the wider impact of redox control on AMPK-related kinases (bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 14-15, bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 17-18).  \nAdditionally, while substrates such as MAPT/TAU, CDC25 isoforms, WEE1, RIMS1, and gamma-tubulin have been identified as targets of BRSK1, further phosphoproteomic studies are underway to elucidate additional substrates and uncover novel regulatory circuits controlled by this kinase (kamireddy2020aquantitativephosphoproteomics pages 27-32, bendzunas2024redoxregulationof pages 12-15).  \nThe role of BRSK1 in diverse processes, ranging from neuronal development to cell cycle regulation, underscores its significance as a hub in signaling networks. Its precise subcellular localization to synaptic vesicles in neurons suggests specialized roles in neurotransmission, while its activity in centrosome regulation places it at a critical nexus between signaling and cell division (bendzunas2024redoxregulationof pages 58-65, koduri2024proteinkinasec pages 13-21).  \nFinally, although BRSK1 has alternative names (SAD-B, Brain-selective kinase 1) and is sometimes grouped with its paralog BRSK2 for functional studies, subtle differences in their catalytic efficiency and regulatory inputs (e.g., differences in sensitivity to LKB1 phosphorylation and redox agents) indicate that they have overlapping yet distinct physiological roles—a subject of ongoing research (bendzunas2024redoxregulationof pages 15-18, bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 2-3).\n\n9.

    "answer": "## 1. Phylogeny  \nBRSK2 belongs to the eukaryotic AMPK‐related kinase (ARK) family and is evolutionarily related to a set of serine/threonine kinases that include BRSK1, NUAK1/2, SIKs, MARKs, MELK, and the classical AMPK catalytic subunits. Within this family, BRSK2 and its paralog BRSK1 represent the brain‐selective branch and can be traced to conserved ancestral kinases that emerged early in vertebrate evolution, with a distinctive set of regulatory cysteine residues playing roles in redox control. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that despite high overall sequence identity between BRSK1 and BRSK2, BRSK2 has accumulated unique redox‐sensitive features—such as a conserved T-loop +2 cysteine and a unique substitution in the activation segment (CPE motif instead of the canonical APE motif)—which are rare among eukaryotic protein kinases, underscoring its specialized functional adaptation in neuronal contexts (bendzunas2024redoxregulationof pages 3-7, bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 2-3).\n\n## 2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nBRSK2 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to specific serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins. In mechanistic terms, the reaction can be described as follows: ATP + [protein substrate] → ADP + [phospho-protein] + H⁺. This phosphorylation event is critical for modulating the activity, conformation, and protein–protein interactions of substrates such as microtubule-associated proteins (e.g., MAPT/TAU), cell cycle regulators (e.g., CDC25C, WEE1), and proteins involved in insulin secretion (e.g., CDK16 and PAK1) (bendzunas2024redoxregulationof pages 12-15, tamir2020gainoffunctiongeneticscreen pages 1-3).\n\n## 3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of BRSK2 is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions—most notably Mg²⁺—which act as cofactors by assisting in the stabilization of ATP and the phosphate transfer reaction. In addition, BRSK2 requires ATP as the phosphate donor and is activated upon phosphorylation by upstream kinases such as LKB1, a modification essential for the full catalytic competence of the kinase domain (bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 1-2, tamir2020gainoffunctiongeneticscreen pages 3-5).\n\n## 4. Substrate Specificity  \nBRSK2 phosphorylates several physiologically relevant substrates in neuronal and metabolic pathways. Key substrates include:  \n– MAPT/TAU, where phosphorylation at specific residues (e.g., Thr-529 and Ser-579) is implicated in neuronal polarization and axonogenesis;  \n– CDC25C, a regulator of cell cycle progression;  \n– WEE1, whose phosphorylation at Ser-642 down-regulates its activity in postmitotic neurons;  \n– CDK16 and PAK1, both of which are involved in the regulation of insulin secretion.  \nKinase activity assays often employ the AMARA peptide—a generic substrate utilized to measure ARK family phosphorylation—with the activity of BRSK2 being modulated by the redox state and phosphorylation status of conserved residues in its activation loop (bendzunas2024redoxregulationof pages 12-15, bendzunas2024redoxregulationof pages 20-23, tamir2020gainoffunctiongeneticscreen pages 1-3).\n\n## 5. Structure  \nBRSK2 is organized into several functionally distinct domains. The N-terminal region contains the catalytic kinase domain, which is responsible for its enzymatic activity. This domain includes highly conserved motifs such as the HRD motif, an activation loop (T-loop) where phosphorylation is required for activation, and a unique T-loop +2 cysteine residue that is essential for redox regulation. Following the kinase domain is a Ubiquitin-Associated (UBA) domain, which may play roles in protein–protein interactions and possibly autoinhibition. Further towards the C-terminus, BRSK2 contains a Proline-Rich Region (PRR), a Kinase-Associated (KA1) domain, and an Autoinhibitory Sequence (AIS), all of which contribute to the fine-tuning of its catalytic activity and subcellular localization. Unique to BRSK2 is the substitution within the activation segment—where the canonical APE motif is replaced by a CPE sequence—facilitating the formation of reversible disulfide bonds and redox-dependent conformational changes that modulate kinase function. Three-dimensional models based on AlphaFold predictions suggest that the kinase domain adopts an active-like conformation, with critical redox-sensitive cysteine residues (e.g., C176 and C183) positioned strategically to influence inter-lobe interactions and allosteric communication (bendzunas2024redoxregulationof pages 51-58, bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 3-5, bendzunas2024redoxregulationof pages 15-18).\n\n## 6. Regulation  \nBRSK2 is regulated by a combination of phosphorylation events and redox-based modifications. Its activation is initiated by the upstream kinase LKB1 through phosphorylation of a conserved residue in the T-loop (e.g., Thr-174 in the kinase domain), a modification that primes BRSK2 for substrate phosphorylation. In addition to this classical phospho-activation, BRSK2 is subject to redox regulation through reversible oxidation of conserved cysteine residues. Specifically, oxidation of the T-loop +2 cysteine and the cysteine within the CPE motif can lead to the formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds, which alter the conformation of the kinase domain and modulate its catalytic activity. Experimental data show that under oxidative conditions (e.g., H₂O₂ treatment), BRSK2 activity is inhibited—a state that can be reversed by reducing agents like DTT or glutathione (GSH), highlighting its role as a sensor of cellular redox status. Moreover, specific mutations in these cysteine residues can either enhance or impair kinase activity, demonstrating the finely tuned balance between phosphorylation-dependent activation and redox-based modulation. This dual regulatory mechanism not only influences enzyme activity but also modulates substrate recognition and downstream signaling pathways, such as those involved in insulin secretion and neuronal polarity (bendzunas2024redoxregulationof pages 12-15, bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 14-15, tamir2020gainoffunctiongeneticscreen pages 5-6).\n\n## 7. Function  \nBRSK2 serves multiple critical roles in both neuronal function and metabolic regulation. In the brain, BRSK2 is instrumental in establishing and maintaining neuronal polarity and promoting axonogenesis, primarily through the phosphorylation of microtubule-associated proteins such as MAPT/TAU. This function is especially important during cortical development, where proper neuron polarization is necessary for the formation of functional neural circuits. In parallel, BRSK2 regulates cell cycle progression by modulating key cell cycle regulators—including phosphorylation of CDC25C—and it influences the mitotic onset by affecting the activity of WEE1 through phosphorylation at Ser-642, thereby ensuring proper cell cycle progression in postmitotic neurons. In addition to its neurodevelopmental functions, BRSK2 plays a critical role in the regulation of insulin secretion, where its activity is modulated by distinct phosphorylation events: phosphorylation at Thr-174 tends to inhibit insulin secretion, whereas phosphorylation at Thr-260 appears to promote insulin release. This dualistic regulation underscores the complex role of BRSK2 in metabolic processes. Furthermore, BRSK2 is implicated in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and may participate in the apoptotic response under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, wherein it contributes to the cellular stress response through mechanisms that likely involve both its kinase activity and redox-sensitive regulatory domains. Expression of BRSK2 is predominantly brain-selective, with notable expression in pancreatic tissues as well, aligning with its roles in neuronal signaling and metabolic regulation (bendzunas2024redoxregulationof pages 3-7, deng2022deleteriousvariationin pages 1-2, hu2023casereporta pages 5-6).\n\n## 8. Other Comments  \nA number of inhibitors have been identified that target BRSK2 or its close relatives in the AMPK-related kinase family. Notably, the compound GW296115 appears as a promising chemical starting point due to its low-nanomolar inhibitory potency and cell-active properties; it has been shown to effectively inhibit BRSK2-mediated phosphorylation events in cellular assays while exhibiting a favorable selectivity profile across a broad kinome panel. These inhibitor studies provide important tools for dissecting BRSK2 function and may eventually contribute to therapeutic strategies targeting conditions such as neurodevelopmental disorders and metabolic diseases. In addition, genetic studies have linked deleterious variation in BRSK2 to neurodevelopmental conditions including autism spectrum disorder, underscoring its significance in neural development and function. Epigenetic regulation, such as DNA methylation at specific CpG sites within BRSK2, has also been associated with disease risk in contexts like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, further highlighting the kinase’s potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target. Overall, the combined insights from biochemical, structural, genetic, and inhibitor studies underscore BRSK2’s role as a multifunctional kinase whose activity is intricately controlled by dual modes of regulation—phosphorylation and redox-dependent cysteine modifications—positioning it as a critical node in pathways governing neuronal polarity, cell cycle progression, and insulin secretion (tamir2020pkisdeepdive pages 1-3, chen2025geneticvariationreveals pages 7-10, tamir2020gainoffunctiongeneticscreen pages 25-29).\n\n## 9.

    "answer": "## 1. Phylogeny  \nExtracellular serine/threonine protein kinase FAM20C belongs to the Fam20 family of atypical secretory pathway kinases, a small and evolutionarily divergent group that also comprises Fam20A and Fam20B, each having distinct yet complementary roles in the phosphorylation of secreted substrates (gersongurwitz2018ancestralrolesof pages 15-18, worby2021theabcsof pages 1-2). Unlike classical cytoplasmic kinases that display high sequence conservation within groups like the AGC, CAMK, or CMGC families, Fam20C exhibits a very different primary structure with limited sequence similarity to conventional kinases, although it retains conserved catalytic residues key for phosphoryl transfer (chen2021proteolyticprocessingof pages 1-2, zhang2018structureandevolution pages 1-2). Phylogenetic analyses indicate that the emergence of Fam20 kinases predates the diversification of metazoans and that orthologs of FAM20C can be found from invertebrate species such as Caenorhabditis elegans up to vertebrates, reflecting a fundamental role in extracellular protein regulation that has been maintained throughout evolution (gersongurwitz2018ancestralrolesof pages 1-5, worby2021theabcsof pages 2-3). In many invertebrates, a single Fam20 kinase exists that appears to display substrate specificity mimicking that of vertebrate FAM20C; in vertebrates, gene duplication events have led to the emergence of three paralogues – Fam20A, Fam20B, and Fam20C – which have specialized functions. Fam20B, for instance, has evolved to act as a xylose kinase involved in proteoglycan biosynthesis, whereas Fam20A has lost catalytic activity and instead functions as an allosteric activator of Fam20C, reinforcing the concept that extracellular phosphorylation is a tightly regulated process adapted for the secretory pathway (du2023regulationofsecretory pages 11-11, worby2021theabcsof pages 1-2). The restricted tissue expression of Fam20C, particularly in cells that participate in biomineralization such as osteoblasts and ameloblasts, further emphasizes its evolutionary adaptation for processing a subset of proteins essential for mineralized tissue formation (palmalara2021fam20coverviewclassic pages 1-2, xu2021fam20cinhuman pages 1-2).\n\nMoreover, sequence comparisons and phylogenetic reconstructions show that despite the divergence in overall amino acid sequence, key features such as the catalytic loop, glycine-rich loop, and motifs involved in ATP binding have been conserved in FAM20C to ensure its kinase function is preserved (zhang2018structureandevolution pages 11-11, du2023regulationofsecretory pages 4-5). This evolutionary conservation suggests that FAM20C’s role in phosphorylating secreted proteins was of critical importance to early multicellular organisms, ultimately contributing to the complex regulation of the extracellular matrix and biomineralization observed in higher vertebrates (gersongurwitz2018ancestralrolesof pages 18-22, worby2021theabcsof pages 1-2). Its unique phylogenetic lineage and divergence from canonical kinases underscore a specialized evolutionary strategy that allows FAM20C to function optimally in the oxidizing environments of the Golgi and extracellular space, thereby meeting the biochemical demands of extracellular protein modification (chen2021proteolyticprocessingof pages 1-2, worby2021theabcsof pages 2-3).\n\n## 2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nFAM20C catalyzes an ATP‐dependent phosphorylation reaction that is central to the post‐translational modification of secretory proteins, ensuring that a large proportion of the extracellular phosphoproteome is correctly processed (chen2021proteolyticprocessingof pages 10-11, johnson2023anatlasof pages 4-5). The chemical reaction involves the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine residues within target proteins, generating ADP and a phosphorylated protein product, along with the release of a proton (H⁺):  \n  ATP + protein–(L‑serine/L‑threonine) → ADP + protein–(L‑serine/threonine‑phosphate) + H⁺ (chen2021proteolyticprocessingof pages 10-11).  \nThis reaction occurs predominantly within the Golgi lumen as secretory proteins traverse through the secretory pathway. FAM20C displays a strong predilection for serine residues that are situated within the canonical consensus sequence Ser–x–Glu, where “x” can be any amino acid but the presence of a glutamate at the +2 position is highly favoured, although substrates with a pre‐phosphorylated serine in that region can experience enhanced phosphorylation efficiency (johnson2023anatlasof pages 4-5, chen2021proteolyticprocessingof pages 10-11).\n\nIn addition to phosphorylating classical extracellular matrix proteins involved in biomineralization, FAM20C also targets substrates that play roles in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) function. For instance, the phosphorylation of oxidoreductase ERO1A by FAM20C is a crucial step in maintaining an appropriate redox environment in the ER that is necessary for oxidative protein folding (du2023regulationofsecretory pages 5-7, johnson2023anatlasof pages 6-7). Under conditions of ER stress, FAM20C phosphorylates protein disulfide isomerase (P4HB/PDIA1), triggering a functional switch that converts the enzyme from its oxidoreductase role to that of a chaperone; this modification is instrumental in sustaining ER proteostasis and reducing cell death by attenuating the activation of the unfolded protein response sensor ERN1 (chen2021proteolyticprocessingof pages 10-11, du2023regulationofsecretory pages 5-7). Thus, the reaction catalyzed by FAM20C not only influences extracellular matrix formation but also interconnects the extracellular secretory pathway with intracellular stress response mechanisms.\n\n## 3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of FAM20C is highly dependent on the availability of divalent metal ions, a common attribute among protein kinases (fulcher2020functionsandregulation pages 14-15, shrestha2023elucidatingtheunderstudied pages 95-101). Magnesium ions (Mg²⁺) are the principal cofactors required by FAM20C for efficient catalysis. Mg²⁺ facilitates the proper positioning and stabilization of ATP within the active site, neutralizing the negative charges on the phosphate groups and thus promoting efficient phosphoryl transfer to the target serine or threonine residues (du2023regulationofsecretory pages 4-5, fulcher2020functionsandregulation pages 14-15).\n\nAlthough some reports have suggested that manganese (Mn²⁺) can support the activity of certain secretory pathway kinases, the biochemical evidence predominantly highlights a requirement for Mg²⁺ in the case of FAM20C, aligning it with the general mechanistic paradigm observed for most serine/threonine kinases (du2023regulationofsecretory pages 4-5, shrestha2023elucidatingtheunderstudied pages 95-101). No additional unusual cofactors or small molecular activators have been documented to be necessary for FAM20C activity, thereby underscoring a reliance on conventional divalent metal ions in its catalytic mechanism. This strict cofactor dependency is critical for ensuring the spatial and temporal regulation of extracellular phosphorylation events in the Golgi apparatus, where ion concentrations are favorable for such catalytic activity (fulcher2020functionsandregulation pages 14-15).\n\n## 4. Substrate Specificity  \nFAM20C is recognized for its broad substrate specificity, with a strong predilection for phosphorylating residues within the canonical consensus motif Ser–x–Glu or a variant thereof that includes a pre-phosphorylated serine at the +2 position (chen2021proteolyticprocessingof pages 10-11, palmalara2021fam20coverviewclassic pages 1-2). This canonical motif serves as a primary signal for substrate recognition by FAM20C; however, proteomic studies have revealed that the kinase modifies a wide array of secreted proteins, indicating that its substrate preference extends beyond strict adherence to this motif (johnson2023anatlasof pages 4-5, du2023regulationofsecretory pages 11-11).\n\nAmong the well-established physiological substrates of FAM20C are secreted proteins that play pivotal roles in biomineralization processes. Notably, FAM20C phosphorylates casein, which has historically served as a marker for casein kinase activity, and a suite of enamel matrix proteins including amelogenin (AMELX), amelotin (AMTN), enamelin (ENAM), and osteopontin (SPP1/OPN); these substrates are essential for the mineralization of bone and dental tissues (chen2021proteolyticprocessingof pages 10-11, palmalara2023potentialroleof pages 24-26). In addition, FAM20C targets ER-resident proteins that transit the secretory pathway. For example, phosphorylation of ERO1A by FAM20C enhances its oxidoreductase activity, which is fundamental for proper disulfide bond formation in nascent proteins (johnson2023anatlasof pages 6-7, gersongurwitz2018ancestralrolesof pages 18-22). Furthermore, under stress conditions, FAM20C phosphorylates P4HB/PDIA1, leading to a functional switch that promotes its chaperone activity—a modification that is critical for alleviating ER stress and maintaining proteostasis (du2023regulationofsecretory pages 5-7, chen2021proteolyticprocessingof pages 10-11).\n\nThe breadth of FAM20C’s substrate recognition is supported by phosphoproteomic analyses which have identified that it is responsible for the phosphorylation of the majority of proteins found in the extracellular phosphoproteome. This expansive substrate repertoire includes proteins that, while lacking the exact consensus sequence, display a pattern of acidic or polar residues that enable binding and phosphorylation by FAM20C (johnson2023anatlasof pages 6-7, du2023regulationofsecretory pages 11-11). Thus, FAM20C demonstrates a versatile substrate specificity that is finely tuned to regulate diverse processes including biomineralization, extracellular matrix remodeling, and ER redox homeostasis.\n\n## 5. Structure  \nFAM20C is characterized by a central kinase domain that adopts the typical two-lobe architecture observed in most protein kinases, with a smaller N-terminal lobe involved predominantly in ATP binding and a larger C-terminal lobe that facilitates substrate binding and catalytic activity (fulcher2020functionsandregulation pages 1-2, shrestha2023elucidatingtheunderstudied…I’llunderstudied pages 1-13). Within this kinase domain, several conserved motifs critical for function are maintained: the glycine-rich loop, which stabilizes ATP binding; the catalytic loop, which contains key residues such as aspartate and lysine for phosphotransfer; and the activation loop, which is thought to contribute to substrate recognition (zhang2018structureandevolution pages 1-2, johnson2023anatlasof pages 3-4).\n\nUnique to FAM20C is the presence of structural insertions that distinguish it from canonical kinases. These insertions and additional surface loops are believed to extend the substrate-binding surface, thereby allowing FAM20C to accommodate a broader range of substrates beyond the strict Ser–x–Glu motif (lopez2022elucidatingthesecreteda pages 13-17, park2021anatypicalminimal pages 9-12). Moreover, structural studies—including crystallographic investigations and AlphaFold predictive modeling—have revealed that FAM20C possesses unique features tailored for functioning in the oxidizing environment of the Golgi apparatus, such as stabilization elements that may be involved in disulfide bond formation and subcellular retention (chen2021proteolyticprocessingof pages 1-2, lopez2022elucidatingthesecreteda pages 13-17).\n\nFAM20C is further characterized by signals in its N-terminal region that drive its localization to the Golgi, ensuring that its kinase activity is confined to the secretory pathway where its substrates predominantly reside (chen2021proteolyticprocessingof pages 1-2, govitvattana2021molecularcloningof pages 8-9). One of the most distinguishing structural features of FAM20C is its ability to form oligomeric complexes. In particular, FAM20C forms complexes with Fam20A, a related but catalytically inactive pseudokinase; this association has been demonstrated to allosterically enhance FAM20C’s enzymatic activity by stabilizing its active conformation and potentially facilitating the proper orientation of substrates within its catalytic cleft (worby2021theabcsof pages 11-12, shrestha2023elucidatingtheunderstudieda pages 65-71). Such oligomerization not only contributes to efficient catalysis but also represents a regulatory mechanism by which the kinase’s activity can be modulated in response to changing cellular conditions.\n\nIn summary, the structure of FAM20C reflects a fusion of a conserved kinase core with specialized regions that tailor its function to the secretory pathway. The combination of a standard two-lobe kinase domain, unique insertions that expand substrate recognition, and Golgi-targeting signals ensures that FAM20C is optimally configured to phosphorylate a diverse array of extracellular proteins in a tightly regulated fashion (fulcher2020functionsandregulation pages 1-2, lopez2022elucidatingthesecreteda pages 13-17).\n\n## 6. Regulation  \nThe activity of FAM20C is subject to several layers of regulation that together ensure precise control over extracellular phosphorylation. A central regulatory mechanism involves the formation of heterooligomeric complexes with Fam20A, a catalytically inactive pseudokinase that exerts allosteric control over FAM20C. Through direct interaction, Fam20A stabilizes FAM20C and enhances its catalytic efficiency, thus enabling a more robust phosphorylation activity when high throughput modification of secretory proteins is required (worby2021theabcsof pages 11-12, shrestha2023elucidatingtheunderstudieda pages 65-71).\n\nIn addition to its allosteric regulation by Fam20A, FAM20C activity is modulated by its spatial confinement within the Golgi apparatus. This subcellular localization is mediated by specific Golgi retention signals embedded within its N-terminal region, which ensure that FAM20C remains in the vicinity of proteins transiting through the secretory pathway. Disruption of this targeting mechanism, whether by mutation or misfolding, can lead to a loss of function and has been implicated in disease conditions characterized by aberrant biomineralization (chen2021proteolyticprocessingof pages 1-2, lopez2022elucidatingthesecreteda pages 13-17).\n\nFurthermore, FAM20C is responsive to cellular stress conditions, particularly endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Under such circumstances, FAM20C phosphorylates key ER-resident proteins such as P4HB/PDIA1. This phosphorylation induces a functional switch in P4HB, converting it from an enzyme that primarily catalyzes disulfide bond formation into a molecular chaperone that assists in the proper folding of proteins under stress conditions. Consequently, this modification facilitates an adaptive response that reduces the burden of misfolded proteins and attenuates the activation of ER stress sensors like ERN1 (chen2021proteolyticprocessingof pages 10-11, du2023regulationofsecretory pages 5-7). Such regulation is critical for maintaining ER proteostasis and ensuring cell survival during periods of elevated stress.\n\nLess extensively characterized but potentially significant are the post‐translational modifications of FAM20C itself. Although the direct evidence for autophosphorylation or other modifications such as ubiquitination is limited, it is conceivable that FAM20C may also be subject to modifications that fine‐tune its activity or turnover (fulcher2020functionsandregulation pages 14-15, shrestha2023elucidatingtheunderstudied pages 95-101). These modifications could represent additional layers of control in response to metabolic cues or changes in cellular state.\n\nIn aggregate, the regulatory mechanisms governing FAM20C involve both allosteric interactions—most notably with Fam20A—and spatial regulation dictated by Golgi localization, with further modulation occurring in response to ER stress. This multi-tiered regulation ensures that FAM20C activity is tightly coupled to the functional demands of the secretory pathway and the broader cellular context (du2023regulationofsecretory pages 5-7, worby2021theabcsof pages 12-13).\n\n## 7. Function  \nFAM20C plays a critical and multifaceted role in cellular physiology through its function as the principal kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of secretory proteins. One of its most well-documented functions is its involvement in biomineralization—a process essential for the proper formation of bones and teeth. By phosphorylating a wide array of mineralization-related substrates such as casein, amelogenin (AMELX), amelotin (AMTN), enamelin (ENAM), and osteopontin (SPP1/OPN), FAM20C directly influences the deposition of calcium and the formation of hydroxyapatite crystals within the extracellular matrix, thereby driving osteoblast differentiation and mineralization (chen2021proteolyticprocessingof pages 10-11, palmalara2021fam20coverviewclassic pages 1-2). The critical role of FAM20C in biomineralization is further underscored by the observation that genetic mutations resulting in its loss-of-function lead to Raine syndrome, a severe osteosclerotic dysplasia characterized by profound skeletal defects and dental anomalies (maan2024analysisofmutations pages 15-20).\n\nIn addition to its extracellular functions, FAM20C also exerts control over intracellular processes that are intimately linked with protein folding and redox homeostasis within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The kinase phosphorylates ERO1A, thereby increasing the enzyme’s oxidoreductase activity that is crucial for forming correct disulfide bonds in nascent proteins, ensuring efficient oxidative protein folding (johnson2023anatlasof pages 6-7, du2023regulationofsecretory pages 5-7). Under conditions of ER stress, FAM20C targets P4HB/PDIA1 for phosphorylation, triggering a switch in P4HB function from an oxidoreductase to a molecular chaperone. This switch not only aids in the alleviation of ER stress by promoting proper protein folding but also reduces pro-apoptotic signalling which is often associated with prolonged ER stress. In this manner, FAM20C acts as an important modulator of ER proteostasis and cell survival (chen2021proteolyticprocessingof pages 10-11, du2023regulationofsecretory pages 5-7).\n\nThe impact of FAM20C extends beyond biomineralization and ER function. It also plays roles in various aspects of cellular homeostasis including lipid metabolism, cell migration, wound healing, and adhesion. The phosphorylation of secreted factors involved in these processes modulates their function and stability, thereby influencing extracellular signaling pathways that are central to tissue repair and cellular communication (johnson2023anatlasof pages 4-5, du2023regulationofsecretory pages 11-11). In tissues characterized by high secretory activity, such as the mammary gland during lactation or dental tissues during enamel formation, FAM20C’s expression is elevated, reflecting its importance in modulating the extracellular environment (chen2021proteolyticprocessingof pages 1-2, govitvattana2021molecularcloningof pages 8-9).\n\nMoreover, by phosphorylating a diverse range of secreted proteins, FAM20C creates a complex network of extracellular signals that regulate the composition, physical properties, and functional activity of the extracellular matrix. This network is not restricted solely to the enhancement of mineralization but also includes the modulation of cell–cell interactions and signaling pathways that govern tissue development and repair. The extensive substrate range of FAM20C, which encompasses both structural matrix proteins and regulatory molecules, positions it as a central hub in the orchestration of extracellular phosphorylation events that underlie a myriad of physiological processes (johnson2023anatlasof pages 10-11, palmalara2023potentialroleof pages 24-26).\n\nAdditionally, FAM20C’s role in controlling ER redox balance through the activation of ERO1A and the modulation of chaperone function via P4HB/PDIA1 has implications for systemic protein quality control. This function is particularly vital under stress conditions when the accumulation of misfolded proteins can trigger pathological responses such as the unfolded protein response. Hence, FAM20C serves as an important link between extracellular matrix dynamics and intracellular stress response pathways, ensuring coordinated regulation of protein synthesis, folding, and secretion (du2023regulationofsecretory pages 5-7, johnson2023anatlasof pages 6-7).\n\nOverall, FAM20C’s functions are far-reaching, encompassing the regulation of both extracellular and intracellular environments. Its precise control over the phosphorylation of secretory proteins is essential for the formation and maintenance of mineralized tissues, the management of ER stress, and the coordination of diverse signaling pathways that together sustain cellular and tissue homeostasis (chen2021proteolyticprocessingof pages 10-11, worby2021theabcsof pages 1-2).\n\n## 8. Other Comments  \nOngoing research continues to elucidate the multifaceted roles of FAM20C, making it an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in a variety of diseases. Genetic mutations that impair the catalytic activity or proper Golgi localization of FAM20C have been directly linked to Raine syndrome—a congenital disorder characterized by severe osteosclerotic bone dysplasia, craniofacial malformations, and dental defects—emphasizing the critical nature of precise extracellular phosphorylation in skeletal development (palmalara2021fam20coverviewclassic pages 1-2, maan2024analysisofmutations pages 15-20). The pathogenic manifestations of these mutations underscore the enzyme’s indispensable role in biomineralization and suggest that even subtle alterations in FAM20C activity can have profound developmental and systemic consequences.\n\nBeyond congenital skeletal dysplasias, aberrant FAM20C activity has also been implicated in processes such as dysregulated cell migration and altered lipid metabolism, both of which are important factors in cancer progression and metastasis. Although no specific inhibitors of FAM20C have been widely adopted in clinical practice, the development of small molecules that either enhance or mimic its activity—particularly by promoting the formation of the activating Fam20A–FAM20C complex—represents a promising area of pharmacological research (venerando2022editorialcaseinkinases pages 4-5, park2019thinkingoutsideof pages 9-9).\n\nFurthermore, the expansive substrate repertoire of FAM20C, which extends to both extracellular matrix proteins and key regulators of ER homeostasis, positions it as a potential biomarker for diverse pathological states, including metabolic disorders, impaired wound healing, and even neurodegenerative conditions where ER stress is a contributing factor. Changes in the phosphorylation status of FAM20C substrates may serve as early indicators of disease progression, thereby offering a route to early diagnosis and targeted therapy (johnson2023anatlasof pages 10-11, du2023regulationofsecretory pages 11-11).\n\nResearch into the regulation of FAM20C is also active, with studies examining both its allosteric activation by Fam20A and the potential for post‐translational modifications that might further modulate its activity. Although comprehensive details of such modifications remain to be fully elucidated, the prospect of developing allosteric activators—compounds that enhance FAM20C function by mimicking the effect of Fam20A—is particularly intriguing given that many disease states associated with FAM20C are thought to arise from a loss-of-function scenario (shrestha2023elucidatingtheunderstudieda pages 65-71, venerando2022editorialcaseinkinases pages 5-6).\n\nThe integration of extracellular phosphorylation with intracellular stress responses, as mediated by FAM20C, represents a novel paradigm in cell biology that continues to challenge traditional boundaries between intracellular and extracellular regulatory mechanisms. As our understanding deepens, it is becoming increasingly clear that FAM20C operates at a critical nexus where secretory pathway function, extracellular matrix dynamics, and ER protein quality control converge. Such insights could pave the way for innovative therapeutic approaches targeting FAM20C activity to treat a range of pathological conditions from skeletal disorders to cancer and metabolic disease (worby2021theabcsof pages 1-2, johnson2023anatlasof pages 10-11).\n\nIn summary, FAM20C serves as a central hub in the regulation of extracellular phosphorylation, with its activity being crucial for both the formation of healthy biomineralized tissues and the maintenance of ER homeostasis. Its broad substrate specificity, combined with sophisticated regulatory mechanisms involving subcellular localization and allosteric activation, underscore the enzyme's pivotal role in ensuring systemic cellular homeostasis. The ongoing exploration of its structure–function relationships, regulatory networks, and disease associations continues to present new opportunities for both fundamental biological discovery and the development of novel clinical interventions.\n\n## 9.

Phylogenetically, this subgroup includes four closely related isoforms – namely, MAPK14 (p38 alpha), MAPK11 (p38 beta), MAPK12 (p38 gamma) and MAPK13 (p38 delta) – that share significant sequence conservation in their catalytic domains while displaying differences in regulatory regions and tissue expression patterns (alnafisah2023alteredkinasenetworks pages 50-55, dahm2025atypicalmapksin pages 1-3). The evolutionary origins of the p38 family can be traced back to a common ancestor among eukaryotes, with orthologs identified broadly in mammals and many other vertebrate lineages. This evolutionary conservation points to the fundamental role these kinases have in mediating cellular stress responses and inflammatory signaling across species (amakiri2021cellsignallinginterplay pages 7-11). In particular, the observed functional redundancy between MAPK11 and MAPK14 suggests that an ancient gene duplication event gave rise to these isoforms, after which they conserved the essential mechanism needed to orchestrate stress and cytokine responses. The conservation of specific motifs, such as the dual phosphorylation T-G-Y activation loop, further underscores the evolutionary pressure to maintain MAPK11’s catalytic function and regulatory interactions (alnafisah2023alteredkinasenetworks pages 50-55, deepak2016pathwayanalysisof pages 81-87).\n\n**2. Reaction Catalyzed**  \nMAPK11 functions as a serine/threonine kinase and catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to target substrates. The reaction follows the canonical ATP‐dependent phosphorylation mechanism typical of the MAPK family. More precisely, the chemical transformation can be represented as:  \n  ATP + protein-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + protein-(phospho-serine/threonine) + H⁺.  \nThis reaction involves the binding of ATP in the kinase’s active site, where, following appropriate alignment with the protein substrate, the γ-phosphate of ATP is transferred to the hydroxyl group of a serine or threonine residue. In doing so, MAPK11 modulates substrate activity and initiates signal propagation cascades in response to extracellular stimuli such as pro-inflammatory cytokines or stress signals (higgins2023sarscov2hijacksp38βmapk11 pages 21-23, invergo2022accuratehighcoverageassignment pages 21-24). The substrate proteins include both components of the downstream kinase cascades and non-kinase targets, which, upon phosphorylation, either change their enzymatic activity, binding capacity, or subcellular localization. This enzymatic process is fundamental to the modulation of immediate-early gene induction as well as to various regulatory networks that govern cell survival, apoptosis, and inflammatory responses (liu2021leveragingdiversedata pages 33-36, amakiri2021cellsignallinginterplay pages 48-52).\n\n**3. Cofactor Requirements**  \nMAPK11 exhibits the classical cofactor requirement characteristic of serine/threonine kinases. The enzyme depends predominantly on divalent metal ions, with Mg²⁺ being indispensable for its catalytic activity. Mg²⁺ ions bind to ATP and assist in the proper orientation of the phosphate groups within the active site, thereby stabilizing the transition state during the phosphoryl transfer reaction. Without Mg²⁺, ATP binding is inefficient and the phosphorylation reaction cannot proceed at a physiologically significant rate (higgins2023sarscov2hijacksp38βmapk11 pages 21-23, moret2020aresourcefor pages 39-43). In addition to Mg²⁺, while no other cofactors have been definitively shown to be essential for MAPK11’s catalytic activity, the kinase’s regulation is achieved via phosphorylation by upstream kinases and possibly through interactions with scaffold proteins that modify its substrate selectivity and subcellular distribution (liu2021leveragingdiversedata pages 69-74, maikrachline2020nuclearp38roles pages 4-6).\n\n**4. Substrate Specificity**  \nMAPK11 demonstrates broad and promiscuous substrate specificity typical of p38 MAP kinases, with estimates suggesting that it phosphorylates between 200 to 300 distinct target proteins. Several of these substrates are itself kinases, contributing to layered signaling cascades. For example, MAPK11 directly phosphorylates downstream kinases such as RPS6KA5 (MSK1) and RPS6KA4 (MSK2), which then further phosphorylate key transcription factors including CREB1, ATF1, and the NF‑κB isoform RELA (NFKB3) (alnafisah2023alteredkinasenetworks pages 50-55, amakiri2021cellsignallinginterplay pages 7-11). The activation of MSK kinases cascades into triggering transcription factors that can reshape immediate-early gene expression programs and induce chromatin remodeling by phosphorylating histone H3 and the nucleosomal protein HMGN1.  \n\nMoreover, MAPK11 phosphorylates other pivotal downstream targets such as MAPKAPK2 (MK2) and MAPKAPK3 (MK3); these kinases modulate gene expression on a post-transcriptional level by phosphorylating RNA binding proteins such as ZFP36 (tristetraprolin) and ELAVL1, and by regulating the activity of elongation factor EEF2K, which is essential for mRNA translation elongation (alnafisah2023alteredkinasenetworks pages 50-55, invergo2022accuratehighcoverageassignment pages 10-12). Additionally, kinases such as MKNK1 and MKNK2, which are activated by MAPK11, engage in the regulation of protein synthesis through the phosphorylation of the initiation factor EIF4E2, thereby affecting translational control at the onset of protein synthesis (liu2021leveragingdiversedata pages 33-36).  \n\nBeyond these kinase cascades, MAPK11 phosphorylates cytoplasmic proteins such as CFLAR, thereby modulating its stability via proteasome-mediated degradation and influencing the cell’s apoptotic threshold. It also regulates the ectodomain shedding of transmembrane proteins by phosphorylating ADAM17, which facilitates the release of TGF-alpha family ligands, ultimately leading to the activation of the EGFR signaling pathway and promoting cell proliferation (amakiri2021cellsignallinginterplay pages 48-52, roche2020p38βandcancer pages 8-10). In the nucleus, MAPK11 phosphorylates an extensive array of transcription factors—including ATF1, ATF2, ATF6, ELK1, PTPRH, DDIT3, and TP53/p53—as well as transcription cofactors such as MEF2C and MEF2A. These phosphorylation events modulate gene expression by affecting chromatin structure, for instance through the enhancement of histone H3 Ser-10 phosphorylation, which increases the accessibility of promoters for inflammatory genes like IL6, IL8, and IL12B (cann2017identifyingtherapeuticagents pages 176-178, li2015unravelingtherole pages 87-91). Additional substrates include components of the inflammasome; under conditions of UV-B irradiation or ribosomal stress, MAPK11 phosphorylates NLRP1 downstream of MAP3K20/ZAK, thereby triggering inflammasome activation and pyroptosis (alnafisah2023alteredkinasenetworks pages 50-55, jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 22-24). Recent findings also indicate that MAPK11 phosphorylates the methyltransferase DOT1L on multiple serine and threonine residues, suggesting a role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression by altering chromatin methylation states (karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 15-17). Although the precise recognition motifs remain less clearly defined owing to the generally short consensus sequence (Ser/Thr-Pro) employed by MAPKs, the contextual contributions of substrate docking sites are critical—these include D domains and DEF motifs that facilitate high-affinity substrate interactions (alnafisah2023alteredkinasenetworks pages 50-55, invergo2022accuratehighcoverageassignment pages 21-24).\n\n**5. Structure**  \nMAPK11 possesses a canonical kinase structure typical of the MAPK family. Its structure is organized around a central catalytic domain that exhibits a bilobal arrangement. The N-terminal lobe is predominantly composed of β-sheets, whereas the C-terminal lobe is richer in α-helices. This bilobal architecture creates an inter-lobe cleft that functions as the ATP-binding pocket, a defining feature in serine/threonine kinases (moret2020aresourcefor pages 39-43, gogl2019disorderedproteinkinase pages 8-10). The kinase domain includes an activation loop that contains the conserved dual phosphorylation motif (T-G-Y) – a sequence critical for full enzymatic activation. In MAPK11, phosphorylation of both the threonine and tyrosine residues within this motif induces a conformational change from an inactive to an active state, facilitating substrate binding and catalytic turnover (higgins2023sarscov2hijacksp38βmapk11 pages 21-23, dahm2025atypicalmapksin pages 1-3).  \n\nStructural studies, although more extensively performed on the closely related p38α, have provided insights into MAPK11’s tertiary structure through homology modeling and limited high-resolution crystallographic data on related isoforms; these suggest that differences may exist in the precise topography of the ATP-binding site. In particular, subtle variations at the periphery of the catalytic cleft may account for differences in inhibitor sensitivity and substrate specificity between MAPK11 and its homologues (roche2020p38βandcancer pages 8-10, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 1-2). In addition to the catalytic domain, MAPK11 contains surface grooves and docking regions—commonly referred to as D-domains and DEF motifs—that are necessary for the recognition and effective binding of downstream substrates. These docking sites help in aligning substrates in the correct orientation relative to the active site, thereby fine-tuning the phosphorylation reaction (jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 24-26, maikrachline2020nuclearp38roles pages 4-6). Furthermore, disordered regions flanking the kinase domain might contribute to regulatory interactions and may influence subcellular localization, similar to what is observed in other MAPK family members (gogl2019disorderedproteinkinase pages 8-10).\n\n**6. Regulation**  \nThe regulation of MAPK11 is intricately controlled by multiple layers of cellular signaling mechanisms. At the most fundamental level, activation of MAPK11 occurs through dual phosphorylation of its activation loop – specifically at the threonine and tyrosine residues within the T-G-Y motif (dahm2025atypicalmapksin pages 1-3, invergo2022accuratehighcoverageassignment pages 21-24). This phosphorylation is mediated primarily by the upstream MAP kinase kinases MKK3 and MKK6, which serve as key activators in response to extracellular signals such as pro-inflammatory cytokines and physical stresses (amakiri2021cellsignallinginterplay pages 48-52, li2015unravelingtherole pages 94-97). The resulting conformational change in MAPK11 transitions the enzyme from a relatively inactive to a fully active state, capable of efficient substrate phosphorylation.  \n\nAutophosphorylation can also play a role in fine-tuning MAPK11’s activity. Intrinsic autophosphorylation events, although not as well characterized as those in some other kinases, may further stabilize the active conformation or modulate basal kinase activity under certain cellular conditions (roche2020p38βandcancer pages 8-10, mullerdott2025fromactivityinference pages 48-52). Scaffold proteins and interacting partners further contribute to the regulation of MAPK11 by localizing both the kinase and its substrates to specific subcellular compartments, thus ensuring spatial and temporal coordination of the signaling cascade. Additionally, phosphatases play a critical role in deactivating MAPK11 by removing phosphate groups from the activation loop, thereby terminating the signal; these regulatory phosphatases help maintain the balance between kinase activation and inactivation during continuous cellular signaling (higgins2023sarscov2hijacksp38βmapk11 pages 21-23, maikrachline2020nuclearp38roles pages 4-6).  \n\nCross-talk with other intracellular signaling pathways further modulates MAPK11 activity. For instance, feedback loops that involve downstream kinases and transcription factors may modulate upstream signaling events through both positive and negative regulatory circuits. In certain contexts, these pathways converge to influence not only the phosphorylation status of MAPK11 but also its subcellular localization and interaction with specific substrates (liu2021leveragingdiversedata pages 74-78, jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 22-24). Moreover, non-canonical mechanisms – such as phosphorylation by atypical kinases under certain stress conditions – have been reported to also influence MAPK11 activity, albeit in a less well-defined manner (dahm2025atypicalmapksin pages 1-3, katopodis2021p38βmapk11 pages 1-2).\n\n**7. Function**  \nMAPK11 plays a multifaceted role in the cellular response to stress and inflammatory stimuli. Acting as a central component of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway, MAPK11 translates extracellular cues—such as exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines and various physical stresses—into intracellular responses that affect gene expression, protein turnover, and cell fate decisions (alnafisah2023alteredkinasenetworks pages 50-55, deepak2016pathwayanalysisof pages 81-87).  \n\nIn the cytoplasm, one of the critical functions of MAPK11 is the regulation of protein turnover. For example, MAPK11 phosphorylates CFLAR, an inhibitor of TNF-induced apoptosis, thereby marking it for proteasomal degradation. This regulation of apoptosis ensures that cells are able to appropriately undergo programmed cell death when stressed, or conversely, avoid premature apoptosis under less severe conditions (cann2017identifyingtherapeuticagents pages 173-176, liu2021leveragingdiversedata pages 142-144). Additionally, MAPK11 modulates ectodomain shedding by phosphorylating the membrane-associated metalloprotease ADAM17. The activation of ADAM17 leads to the shedding of TGF-alpha family ligands, which in turn triggers EGFR signaling pathways that stimulate cell proliferation and survival—a process that is particularly relevant in contexts of inflammation and cancer development (amakiri2021cellsignallinginterplay pages 48-52, roche2020p38βandcancer pages 8-10).  \n\nMoreover, MAPK11 has a pivotal role in receptor signaling through its regulation of FGFR1. Phosphorylation events mediated by MAPK11 facilitate the translocation of FGFR1 from the extracellular membrane to the cytosol and nucleus, where it participates in processes such as rRNA synthesis and cell growth. This kinase-mediated receptor trafficking thereby influences critical cellular functions, including those related to proliferation and metabolic regulation (liu2021leveragingdiversedata pages 142-144, moret2020aresourcefor pages 23-26).  \n\nWithin the nucleus, MAPK11 exerts extensive control over gene expression. It phosphorylates multiple transcription factors—including ATF1, ATF2, ATF6, ELK1, PTPRH, DDIT3, and TP53/p53—as well as transcription cofactors like MEF2C and MEF2A. These phosphorylation events alter the transcription factor activity and promote the rapid induction of immediate-early genes, particularly in response to cellular stress. A key molecular mechanism involves the phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser-10 near promoters of inflammatory genes such as IL6, IL8, and IL12B, which enhances the recruitment of NF‑κB and thereby stimulates the transcription of cytokine genes during inflammatory responses (cann2017identifyingtherapeuticagents pages 176-178, maikrachline2020nuclearp38roles pages 4-6).  \n\nFurthermore, MAPK11 is implicated in innate immune signaling through its ability to phosphorylate components of the inflammasome. Under conditions of UV-B irradiation or ribosomal stress leading to collisions, MAPK11 phosphorylates NLRP1 downstream of MAP3K20/ZAK, resulting in the activation of the NLRP1 inflammasome and subsequent pyroptotic cell death. This mechanism serves as a protective measure against cellular damage and helps in regulating inflammation (alnafisah2023alteredkinasenetworks pages 50-55, jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 22-24).  \n\nBeyond these signaling roles, MAPK11 also appears to participate in the control of epigenetic modifications. For instance, phosphorylation of the methyltransferase DOT1L at several serine and threonine residues has been linked to alterations in chromatin structure, suggesting that MAPK11 may influence gene expression by modulating the epigenetic landscape during cellular stress and inflammatory responses (karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 15-17, alnafisah2023alteredkinasenetworks pages 50-55). Collectively, these functions place MAPK11 as a central integrator of diverse signaling pathways that control cell proliferation, apoptosis, immune responses, and chromatin remodeling under varying physiological and pathological conditions.\n\n**8. Other Comments**  \nAn important challenge in studying MAPK11 is its functional redundancy with MAPK14 (p38 alpha). While both isoforms share many substrates and regulatory mechanisms, subtle differences in substrate affinity, tissue expression, and inhibitor sensitivity suggest that MAPK11 has unique contributions that remain to be fully elucidated (alnafisah2023alteredkinasenetworks pages 50-55, katopodis2021p38βmapk11 pages 1-2). The broad substrate repertoire of MAPK11—which encompasses key regulators of transcription, mRNA translation, protein turnover, and even epigenetic modifications—underlines its vital role as an integrative hub in the cellular stress response network (liu2021leveragingdiversedata pages 69-74, ivan2021posttranslationalproteinmodifications pages 127-130).  \n\nMAPK11’s involvement in processes such as ectodomain shedding, inflammasome activation, and receptor translocation has spurred interest in characterizing its potential as a therapeutic target in inflammatory disorders and cancer. Several studies have demonstrated that targeting components of the p38 MAPK pathway can modulate tumor growth and inflammatory responses, although selective inhibitors for MAPK11 remain under active development (madkour2021currentstatusand pages 2-2, roche2020p38βandcancer pages 8-10). In addition, chemical genetic approaches and deep-learning coupled proximity proteomic techniques are being employed to improve our understanding of MAPK11’s network interactions and substrate specificity, paving the way for the development of more selective and efficacious small molecule inhibitors (jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 12-14, liu2021leveragingdiversedata pages 74-78).  \n\nThe challenges in isoform-specific detection, partly due to the high sequence and structural similarity among p38 MAPK family members, underscore the importance of developing more refined biochemical reagents and high-throughput assays. Accurate discrimination between MAPK11 and MAPK14 is particularly important given their overlapping yet distinct roles in cellular signaling pathways, and such discrimination will be critical for discerning the precise biological functions of each isoform (gogl2019disorderedproteinkinase pages 8-10, moret2020aresourcefor pages 26-29). Lastly, while the detailed three-dimensional structural features of MAPK11 have not been as widely characterized as those of p38α, current studies indicate that subtle differences in the ATP-binding pocket and substrate docking regions could serve as the basis for isoform-selective inhibitor design, which represents a significant opportunity in therapeutic development (roche2020p38βandcancer pages 8-10, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 15-17).\n\n**9.

    "answer": "1. Phylogeny  \nMAPK12, also known as p38γ, ERK6, or SAPK3, is a member of the p38 mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, which comprises four isoforms (p38α, p38β, p38γ, and p38δ) that evolved from common ancestral kinases within the eukaryotic kinome (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 1-1). Phylogenetically, p38γ shares approximately 60% amino acid identity with p38α and p38β and about 70% with p38δ, reflecting its divergence through gene duplication events in the common ancestor of vertebrates (cuadrado2010mechanismsandfunctions pages 1-1, escos2016p38γandp38δ pages 1-2). This isoform clusters with the “alternative” p38 isoforms alongside p38δ, in contrast to p38α and p38β that are more ubiquitously expressed; phylogenetic analyses reveal that while p38α and p38β are conserved in all mammalian species, p38γ exhibits tissue‐restricted expression, notably in skeletal muscle and parts of the nervous system, emphasizing its specialized function (yokota2016p38mapkinases pages 1-2, martinezlimon2020thep38pathway pages 1-3). Orthologs of p38γ have been identified across many vertebrates, consistent with its fundamental role in stress and inflammatory responses, and its conservation underscores the ancient origin of MAPK signaling modules that are traced back to the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) (kyriakis2012mammalianmapksignal pages 2-3, orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 25-29).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nMAPK12 functions as a serine/threonine protein kinase that catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 1-1, samadani2015abstract3705overcoming pages 15-21). In this reaction, it phosphorylates target proteins at specific serine/threonine sites, typically preceded or followed by proline residues, thereby modifying the conformation, activity, stability, or subcellular localization of the substrate (cuadrado2010mechanismsandfunctions pages 2-3). The kinase activity of MAPK12 is crucial for transducing extracellular stimuli—including pro-inflammatory cytokines and physical stress—into intracellular responses. These responses include direct phosphorylation of transcription factors such as ELK1 and ATF2, as well as downstream kinases like MAPKAPK2 that further amplify and diversify the phosphorylation cascade leading to broad effects on gene expression and cellular behavior (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8, risco2012newinsightsinto pages 5-6).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of MAPK12 requires the binding of ATP as the phosphate donor, and like most protein kinases, its activity is dependent on divalent metal ions, particularly Mg²⁺, which coordinate the binding of ATP within the kinase domain (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 1-1, lai2015investigationsofthe pages 49-55). In several MAPK family members, Mg²⁺ ions are critical to stabilize the transition state during the phosphate transfer reaction, and this requirement is also conserved in MAPK12 (cuadrado2010mechanismsandfunctions pages 2-3). No additional non-metal cofactors are reported as necessary for its basic catalytic function, although regulatory proteins and scaffold molecules may influence its activity indirectly.\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nMAPK12 exhibits substrate specificity that is determined primarily by the recognition of serine/threonine-proline motifs, a hallmark of proline-directed kinases (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8, samadani2015abstract3705overcoming pages 15-21). Physiologically, MAPK12 phosphorylates a broad spectrum of substrates – it is estimated to have between 200 to 300 substrates – including transcription factors such as ELK1 and ATF2, proteins involved in cell-cycle regulation such as cyclin D1 (where it can mediate its down-regulation), and cytoskeletal and adaptor proteins such as DLG1 (escos2016p38γandp38δ pages 1-2, risco2012newinsightsinto pages 8-9). In skeletal muscle cells, MAPK12 has been implicated in the regulation of proteins involved in glucose transport; specifically, it modulates the expression levels of SLC2A1 and SLC2A4, thereby affecting basal and contraction-mediated glucose uptake (vind2020ribosomalstresssurveillancethree pages 10-11, martinezlimon2020thep38pathway pages 10-12). The consensus recognition motif involves phosphorylatable serine or threonine residues immediately followed by a proline, often within a larger docking context that may include additional basic or hydrophobic residues to aid in substrate binding (yang2014functionalrolesof pages 1-2, samadani2015abstract3705overcoming pages 31-37).\n\n5. Structure  \nThe structure of MAPK12 conforms to the canonical architecture observed in MAP kinases, featuring two distinct lobes: an N-terminal small lobe predominantly consisting of beta sheets and an expanded C-terminal lobe largely composed of alpha-helices (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8, cuadrado2010mechanismsandfunctions pages 2-3). Central to its structure is the kinase domain, which houses the ATP-binding cleft and the activation loop containing the conserved Thr-Gly-Tyr (TGY) motif critical for its dual phosphorylation and subsequent activation (orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 25-29, hui2014creationandcharacterization pages 20-24). The enzyme also contains docking sites—sometimes referred to as common docking (CD) domains—and DEF (docking site for ERK, FXF) motifs that facilitate substrate and regulator interactions and thus contribute to its specificity (samadani2015abstract3705overcoming pages 15-21). While high-resolution crystal structures specific to MAPK12 have been less frequently reported compared to p38α, structural studies on related p38 isoforms provide evidence that MAPK12 adopts the typical MAPK fold. Unique features of MAPK12 include a relatively restricted expression-related conformation, and its interaction with proteins like DLG1 may involve structural elements in its non-catalytic regions that mediate protein–protein interactions independently of its enzymatic activity (risco2012newinsightsinto pages 5-6, orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 25-29).\n\n6. Regulation  \nMAPK12 is regulated via a hierarchical phosphorylation cascade typical of MAPKs. Its full activation requires dual phosphorylation at threonine and tyrosine residues within the TGY activation loop, events that are catalyzed primarily by the upstream kinases MKK3 and MKK6 (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8, kyriakis2012mammalianmapksignal pages 3-5). In addition to this classical activation mechanism, there is evidence that under certain cellular contexts, alternative regulatory inputs such as TAB1-mediated autophosphorylation can contribute to MAPK12 activation (orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 25-29, samadani2015abstract3705overcoming pages 31-37). Regulation of its activity is further modulated by protein–protein interactions with scaffold proteins and regulatory phosphatases that dephosphorylate the TGY motif, thereby switching off the kinase activity (risco2012newinsightsinto pages 2-4, sahlberg2014theexpressionof pages 31-33). Moreover, MAPK12 engages in kinase-independent functions; for example, following osmotic shock, its nuclear accumulation and binding to DLG1 affect the formation of DLG1–SFPQ complexes, with consequences for mRNA processing and transcription that occur independently of its catalytic activity (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8, martinezlimon2020thep38pathway pages 3-5). These multiple layers of regulation allow MAPK12 to integrate stress signals and execute appropriate downstream responses, including checkpoint signaling and DNA repair following UV and gamma-radiation exposure (risco2012newinsightsinto pages 8-9).\n\n7. Function  \nMAPK12 plays central roles in translating extracellular stress stimuli into specific intracellular responses. As a stress-activated protein kinase, it modulates cellular responses to pro-inflammatory cytokines and various physical stresses such as osmotic shock, UV irradiation, and hypoxia (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 1-1, yang2014functionalrolesof pages 1-2). One critical functional aspect of MAPK12 is its ability to phosphorylate transcription factors (such as ATF2 and ELK1), thereby directly influencing gene expression programs that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8, risco2012newinsightsinto pages 1-2). In muscle cells, MAPK12 has been shown to regulate myoblast differentiation and to stimulate the expansion of transient amplifying myogenic precursor cells, thus playing a key role in muscle growth and regeneration (martinezlimon2020thep38pathway pages 10-12, risko2012newinsightsinto pages 8-9). Its activity also impacts glucose uptake: it positively regulates SLC2A1 expression and basal glucose uptake in myotubes while negatively regulating the expression of SLC2A4, thereby fine-tuning the cellular response to metabolic cues (vind2020ribosomalstresssurveillancethree pages 10-11). Additionally, MAPK12 is involved in maintaining genomic stability by ensuring proper kinetochore localization of PLK1, which is essential to prevent chromosomal instability during mitosis and support mitotic cell viability (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8, riscO2012newinsightsinto pages 8-9). Beyond its catalytic roles, the kinase can modulate protein complexes through non-enzymatic interactions; for instance, after osmotic stress, its binding to DLG1 in the nucleus leads to the dissociation of DLG1–SFPQ complexes, potentially affecting mRNA processing and transcription regulation, thereby contributing to cell adaptation in variable osmolar conditions (escos2016p38γandp38δ pages 1-2, samadani2015abstract3705overcoming pages 31-37). Collectively, these functions position MAPK12 as an essential signaling nexus coordinating stress responses, transcriptional regulation, cell cycle progression, and metabolic homeostasis across various tissues, particularly muscle (yonkota2016p38mapkinases pages 1-2, martinezlimon2020thep38pathway pages 1-3).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSelectivity toward MAPK isoforms remains a challenge when developing kinase inhibitors, and while a number of p38 inhibitors have been identified, few have shown strong specificity toward MAPK12. Most existing compounds, such as the pyridinyl imidazoles, inhibit p38α and p38β more effectively than MAPK12, prompting research into next‐generation inhibitors that can target p38γ with higher specificity (zarrin2021kinaseinhibitionin pages 15-16, williams2017emergingrolesof pages 18-22). Dysregulation of MAPK12 signaling has been associated with a range of pathological conditions, including inflammatory diseases, certain cancers, and metabolic disorders; for instance, its role in down-regulating cyclin D1 under hypoxia and in modulating glucose uptake suggests potential links to both cancer progression and insulin resistance (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8, li2015unravelingtherole pages 94-97). In addition, mutations affecting regulatory regions or phosphorylation sites within MAPK12 could disrupt its signaling output, leading to genomic instability or altered cellular differentiation. Current efforts in structural biology, including crystallography and AlphaFold modeling, are aimed at elucidating the precise structural features of MAPK12 to drive the rational design of more selective inhibitors (orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 25-29, morgan2022mitogen‐activatedproteinkinase‐activated pages 3-4). With expanding research on its kinase-independent roles and non-canonical functions, future studies are expected to refine our understanding of MAPK12’s functions and its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases characterized by aberrant stress signaling and metabolic dysregulation (risco2012newinsightsinto pages 8-9, whitaker2021stressrelieftechniques pages 1-2).\n\n9.

    "answer": "## 1. Phylogeny  \n5′-AMP-activated protein kinase catalytic subunit alpha-2 (PRKAA2), also designated as AMPKα2 or AMPK2, forms an integral component of the cellular energy homeostasis machinery that is evolutionarily conserved among eukaryotes. This kinase belongs to the serine/threonine kinase family and is grouped within the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CAMK) branch, which includes other kinases that respond to changes in cellular energy and nutrient status. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that the basic elements of the AMPK complex appeared very early in evolution and that orthologs of PRKAA2 can be identified in a broad spectrum of organisms ranging from unicellular yeast to complex mammals. In lower eukaryotes, a single catalytic subunit of AMPK is often present; however, gene duplication events in vertebrates have resulted in two distinct isoforms – AMPKα1, encoded by PRKAA1, and AMPKα2, encoded by PRKAA2. AMPKα2 is thought to have evolved to assume specialized roles in tissues that exhibit high metabolic demands, such as skeletal and cardiac muscle, where precise and rapid energy sensing is crucial for proper function (arkwright2015lessonsfromnature pages 3-4, dasgupta2016evolvinglessonson pages 1-2). Furthermore, the modular heterotrimeric architecture composed of the catalytic α subunit together with regulatory β and γ subunits is a feature that has been preserved since the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA), underscoring the fundamental nature of its regulatory mechanisms. Phylogenetic profiling and ortholog identification methods have demonstrated that sequences homologous to PRKAA2 consistently appear across metazoans, plants, and fungi, highlighting its ancient and indispensable role in coupling the cellular energy state to metabolic control (jain2018studyingampkin pages 1-3).\n\n## 2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nAMPKα2 functions as a classical serine/threonine protein kinase and catalyzes the transfer of the γ-phosphate moiety from ATP to specific serine or threonine residues on a range of substrate proteins. The reaction is formally represented as:  \n\n  ATP + [protein]-(Ser/Thr) → ADP + [protein]-(Ser/Thr)-phosphate + H⁺  \n\nThis basic phosphoryl transfer reaction is central to the enzyme’s ability to modulate protein function through post-translational modification. Under conditions of cellular energy deficit, reflected by an increased AMP/ATP ratio, AMPKα2 becomes activated and subsequently phosphorylates key target enzymes. For instance, phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylases (ACACA and ACACB) decreases their activity, thereby inhibiting fatty acid synthesis and favoring fatty acid oxidation—a metabolic switch critical for restoring ATP levels. Similarly, phosphorylation of glycogen synthase (GYS1) leads to reduced glycogen synthesis, rerouting glucose substrates toward energy production rather than storage. In addition, AMPKα2 targets enzymes involved in cholesterol synthesis and modulates factors that regulate insulin signaling and glycolysis. The precise mechanism of the phosphoryl transfer involves the proper positioning of both ATP and the substrate within the catalytic cleft of the kinase domain, where nucleophilic attack occurs at the γ-phosphate of ATP, resulting in the production of ADP and a phosphorylated protein substrate. Such modifications are essential to rapidly alter the activity of metabolic enzymes and transcriptional regulators in response to energy stress (phadke2015chemicalmodulationof pages 83-87, dasgupta2016evolvinglessonson pages 4-6).\n\n## 3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of AMPKα2 is highly dependent on essential cofactors that ensure proper substrate engagement and optimal phosphoryl transfer. The foremost requirement is the divalent metal ion magnesium (Mg²⁺), which plays a critical role in the formation of the MgATP complex. This complex is the true substrate for kinases, as Mg²⁺ coordinates with ATP to stabilize its structure in a conformation favorable for phosphate transfer. The ion’s role is thus twofold: it ensures the effective positioning of ATP in the active site and directly participates in the catalysis by stabilizing the negative charges on the phosphate groups during the transition state. In addition to magnesium, the regulatory nucleotides AMP and ADP are not cofactors in the classic sense; however, their binding to the γ subunit of the AMPK heterotrimer is vital for allosteric regulation. Binding of AMP and ADP induces conformational changes that not only promote the phosphorylation of Thr172—an essential activatory phosphorylation site on AMPKα2—but also safeguard this phosphorylated residue from dephosphorylation by phosphatases. Thus, while Mg²⁺ is critical for the catalytic reaction, AMP and ADP serve as molecular sensors that align the kinase activity of AMPKα2 with the prevailing cellular energy status (phadke2015chemicalmodulationof pages 83-87, ovens2021posttranslationalmodificationsof pages 2-5, lin2018ampksensingglucose pages 3-4).\n\n## 4. Substrate Specificity  \nAMPKα2 is characterized by a broad substrate specificity that underlies its role as a master regulator of cellular energy metabolism. Its substrates include a wide array of metabolic enzymes, signaling intermediates, and transcriptional regulators, all of which contribute to the coordinated cellular response during energy stress. Among the most physiologically relevant substrates are enzymes involved in lipid metabolism. For example, phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase isoforms ACACA and ACACB by AMPKα2 leads to their inactivation. This modification results in decreased fatty acid synthesis while simultaneously promoting fatty acid oxidation—a dual effect that conserves energy under metabolic stress. Additionally, AMPKα2 phosphorylates hormone-sensitive lipase (LIPE), an enzyme crucial for mobilizing lipids from storage droplets, thereby facilitating lipolysis. Enzymes such as hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), which plays a key role in cholesterol biosynthesis, are also targeted by AMPKα2, effectively throttling cholesterol synthesis when energy is scarce (arkwright2015lessonsfromnature pages 3-4, phadke2015chemicalmodulationof pages 83-87).\n\nBeyond its impact on lipid metabolism, AMPKα2 modulates glucose homeostasis by phosphorylating enzymes and regulatory proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Phosphorylation of glycogen synthase (GYS1) diminishes its activity, leading to reduced glycogen synthesis, and nudges glucose substrates toward catabolic pathways that yield ATP. In the context of insulin signaling, AMPKα2 phosphorylates key proteins such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and glycolytic regulators like PFKFB2 and PFKFB3. These modifications are instrumental in enhancing insulin sensitivity and promoting energy production by stimulating glucose uptake, partially through the translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 to the plasma membrane. This orchestrated control over nutrient metabolism exemplifies the enzyme’s capacity to finely tune both immediate and longer-term adaptive responses to energy depletion (phadke2015chemicalmodulationof pages 96-100, dasgupta2016evolvinglessonson pages 1-2, mestareehi2021proteinphosphatase2a pages 229-232, lin2018ampksensingglucose pages 3-4).\n\nIn addition to enzymes directly linked to nutrient metabolism, AMPKα2 targets a plethora of transcriptional regulators and chromatin components. Key substrates include CRTC2/TORC2 and FOXO3, whose phosphorylation alters their cellular localization and transcriptional activity, leading to changes in gene expression that support long-term metabolic adaptation. Phosphorylation of histone H2B, particularly at Ser36, is another example, indicating that AMPKα2 can exert epigenetic control over gene expression in response to energetic cues. Overall, although the precise consensus sequence for AMPK phosphorylation is not rigidly defined, substrates typically feature serine or threonine residues situated within a context of basic or hydrophobic amino acids, allowing AMPKα2 to recognize a diverse range of target proteins (arkwright2015lessonsfromnature pages 3-4, phadke2015chemicalmodulationof pages 83-87).\n\n## 5. Structure  \nThe structure of AMPKα2 is defined by its modular design, which integrates a catalytic kinase domain along with regulatory regions that mediate interactions within the heterotrimeric complex. The N-terminal portion of AMPKα2 harbors a canonical serine/threonine kinase domain organized into two lobes: a smaller N-lobe, which is rich in β-strands and is primarily responsible for binding MgATP, and a larger C-lobe that contains the substrate-binding region and an activation loop. The activation loop, featuring the critical threonine residue Thr172, is the central regulatory element; phosphorylation at this site triggers a conformational change that increases catalytic activity considerably, often by more than 100-fold (hawley2023bay3827andsbi0206965 pages 1-2).\n\nImmediately following the kinase domain is an autoinhibitory domain (AID), which in the basal state interacts with the kinase domain to maintain the enzyme in a relatively low-activity conformation. This autoinhibitory interaction can be relieved by allosteric signals, particularly through the binding of AMP to the regulatory γ subunit of the AMPK heterotrimer. An intervening α-linker region connects the catalytic core to a serine/threonine-rich (ST) loop located near the C-terminus. The ST loop serves as a platform for several regulatory phosphorylation events that influence the accessibility of the activation loop (especially Thr172) to both upstream activating kinases and validating phosphatases (ovens2021posttranslationalmodificationsof pages 21-22, ovens2021posttranslationalmodificationsof pages 5-6).\n\nWhen fully assembled into its heterotrimeric form, the AMPK complex consists of the catalytic α subunit, a regulatory β subunit, and a nucleotide-sensing γ subunit. The β subunit contributes a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM), which is implicated in glycogen binding as well as in forming part of the allosteric drug and metabolite (ADaM) site. In parallel, the γ subunit comprises several cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) domains that create binding pockets for AMP, ADP, and ATP. These nucleotide-binding events promote dynamic structural rearrangements that ultimately affect the conformation and function of the kinase domain in AMPKα2 (hawley2023bay3827andsbi0206965 pages 18-19, ovens2021posttranslationalmodificationsof pages 2-5).\n\nKey catalytic residues within the kinase domain include the invariant lysine crucial for ATP binding and a glycine-rich loop that properly orients the nucleotide in the active site. Structural studies employing crystallography and computational models (complemented by AlphaFold predictions) have underscored the conservation of these features among eukaryotic kinases, and have illuminated the dynamic conformational shifts that occur upon Thr172 phosphorylation—changes that are critical for switching the kinase into its active state (hawley2023bay3827andsbi0206965 pages 1-2).\n\n## 6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of AMPKα2 is a multi-layered process that integrates allosteric modulation, post-translational modifications (PTMs), and the formation of heterotrimeric complexes. The cornerstone of AMPKα2 activation is the phosphorylation of Thr172 within the activation loop of the kinase domain. This phosphorylation event is essential for full catalytic activity and is carried out primarily by upstream kinases such as LKB1 under conditions of energy stress. In parallel, CaMKKβ and in some situations TAK1 can phosphorylate Thr172, ensuring that AMPKα2 responds to a variety of cellular signals (dasgupta2016evolvinglessonson pages 1-2, hawley2023bay3827andsbi0206965 pages 1-2).\n\nAllosteric regulation is further mediated by the binding of AMP—and to a lesser extent ADP—to the γ subunit of the AMPK complex. The occupancy of these nucleotide-binding sites induces a conformational change that favors the phosphorylation of Thr172 by upstream kinases while simultaneously protecting the phosphorylated residue from dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases. This dual role of AMP and ADP ensures that AMPKα2 becomes activated precisely when the cellular energy charge is low (lin2018ampksensingglucose pages 3-4, ovens2021posttranslationalmodificationsof pages 2-5).\n\nBeyond Thr172, additional phosphorylation events on AMPKα2 contribute to its fine-tuned regulation. Within the serine/threonine-rich (ST) loop and the α-linker regions, residues such as Ser345 have been identified as phosphorylation sites that can exert inhibitory effects by reducing access of activating kinases to Thr172 or promoting dephosphorylation. Kinases including PKA, CDK4, and GSK3 are implicated in these regulatory modifications, providing a negative feedback mechanism that prevents excessive AMPK activation during conditions of nutrient sufficiency (mohanty2025rethinkingampka pages 15-16, ovens2021posttranslationalmodificationsof pages 5-6).\n\nAdditional layers of regulation arise from the heterotrimer composition itself. Changes in the expression levels or isoform composition of the β and γ subunits can alter the sensitivity of the AMPK complex to AMP/ADP and affect subcellular localization. Moreover, other post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination, sumoylation, acetylation, and oxidative modifications have been reported. Although the precise roles of these modifications are still being elucidated, they are believed to influence the stability of AMPKα2, its interaction with other proteins, and its overall responsiveness to metabolic signals (ovens2021posttranslationalmodificationsof pages 16-18, mohanty2025rethinkingampka pages 15-16).\n\nThus, the activity of AMPKα2 is controlled by a sophisticated network in which phosphorylation of Thr172 acts as the acute switch on, while additional modifications of peripheral sites provide fine control over its overall kinase function. This multifaceted regulatory scheme enables the enzyme not only to respond rapidly to changes in the cellular energy status but also to integrate long-term signals that affect cell growth, metabolism, and survival (dasgupta2016evolvinglessonson pages 1-2, hawley2023bay3827andsbi0206965 pages 19-20, ovens2021posttranslationalmodificationsof pages 20-21, ovens2021posttranslationalmodificationsof pages 21-22).\n\n## 7. Function  \nAMPKα2 functions as the pivotal metabolic switch that orchestrates the cellular response to energy depletion by coordinating both immediate and long-term adaptations. Under conditions when ATP levels fall and AMP concentration rises, AMPKα2 is activated and triggers a cascade of phosphorylation events intended to restore energy balance. One of its most well-documented functions is the regulation of lipid metabolism. By phosphorylating ACACA and ACACB, AMPKα2 inhibits fatty acid synthesis while promoting fatty acid oxidation—a metabolic reprogramming that provides rapid access to energy stores. This action is complemented by the phosphorylation of LIPE, which facilitates lipolysis, and the suppression of HMGCR, thus constraining cholesterol biosynthesis (arkwright2015lessonsfromnature pages 3-4, phadke2015chemicalmodulationof pages 96-100).\n\nIn addition to its role in lipid metabolism, AMPKα2 exerts significant control over glucose homeostasis. Phosphorylation of glycogen synthase (GYS1) by AMPKα2 decreases glycogen synthesis, thereby directing glucose toward energy-generating pathways rather than storage. It also modulates insulin signaling through targeted phosphorylation of IRS1 and influences glycolysis via modifications of PFKFB2 and PFKFB3. A key functional outcome of these phosphorylation events is the promotion of glucose uptake, particularly in skeletal muscle, where the translocation of the GLUT4 glucose transporter to the plasma membrane is enhanced. This adaptive response is critical for restoring energy balance under conditions of nutrient scarcity (dasgupta2016evolvinglessonson pages 11-12, ertefai2016resistancemechanismsduring pages 313-321).\n\nBeyond its immediate metabolic effects, AMPKα2 is instrumental in driving long-term adaptive responses by modulating gene expression. Phosphorylation of transcriptional regulators such as CRTC2/TORC2, FOXO3, and histone H2B (notably at Ser36) leads to changes in chromatin structure and the transcription of genes that underpin a shift toward catabolic metabolism. These transcriptional changes result in a more sustained cellular adaptation to energy stress, affecting processes such as mitochondrial biogenesis, autophagy, and overall stress survival (arkwright2015lessonsfromnature pages 3-4, dasgupta2016evolvinglessonson pages 11-12).\n\nMoreover, AMPKα2 plays a central role in controlling cell growth and proliferation by negatively regulating the mTORC1 pathway. Through phosphorylation of TSC2, RPTOR, and WDR24, AMPKα2 inhibits mTORC1, thereby limiting anabolic processes (e.g., protein synthesis) and promoting cellular autophagy. This mTORC1 inhibition is particularly important during nutrient limitation, as it facilitates the recycling of cellular components and prevents the wastage of precious energy resources. Furthermore, phosphorylation of autophagy-related proteins such as ULK1 and WDR45/WIPI4 by AMPKα2 actively promotes autophagic processes essential for cell survival during prolonged energy stress (mestareehi2021proteinphosphatase2a pages 229-232, dasgupta2016evolvinglessonson pages 11-12).\n\nIn addition, AMPKα2 intersects with pathways governing apoptosis and cell cycle regulation. Its ability to phosphorylate caspase-6 prevents caspase autoprocessing and apoptosis, thereby affording protection to cells during transient periods of metabolic stress. By also influencing the activity of factors such as FNIP1 and p53, AMPKα2 contributes to balancing cell proliferation and survival in alignment with the cellular energy state (mohanty2025rethinkingampka pages 1-2, mestareehi2021proteinphosphatase2a pages 225-229).\n\nLastly, AMPKα2 has been implicated in the control of cellular polarity and cytoskeletal dynamics. Through the phosphorylation of targets such as beta-catenin (CTNNB1) and possibly via indirect regulation of myosin activity, AMPKα2 may affect cellular motility and tissue organization. These functions underscore its dual role not only as a metabolic regulator but also as a coordinator of broader cellular architectural processes, linking energy status to changes in cell shape, migration, and intercellular interactions (arkwright2015lessonsfromnature pages 3-4, ovens2021posttranslationalmodificationsof pages 9-10).\n\n## 8. Other Comments  \nDue to its central role in energy management, AMPKα2 has attracted extensive attention as a therapeutic target for metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. Pharmacological activation of AMPKα2 using agents that increase AMP binding or that promote Thr172 phosphorylation has shown promise in improving insulin sensitivity and metabolic flexibility. Conversely, paradoxical inhibitors have been described which, while inhibiting downstream substrate phosphorylation, can increase Thr172 phosphorylation—underscoring the complexity of AMPKα2 regulation and the need for isoform-specific modulators (hawley2023bay3827andsbi0206965 pages 13-15, mohanty2025rethinkingampka pages 15-16).\n\nIn oncology, AMPKα2 plays a dual role. In some cancers, activation of AMPKα2 acts as a tumor suppressor by limiting biosynthetic pathways and curtailing cell growth under nutrient stress; in other contexts, however, cells may exploit an activated AMPKα2 pathway to survive under adverse conditions such as hypoxia or extreme metabolic stress. This dichotomy has spurred research into the impact of AMPKα2 expression levels and mutations on cancer outcomes, as well as on the potential of AMPKα2-targeted therapies to resensitize resistant tumors (ertefai2016resistancemechanismsduring pages 309-313, dasgupta2016evolvinglessonson pages 11-12).\n\nFurthermore, the heterotrimeric composition of AMPK, which can vary depending on the isoforms of the β and γ subunits, is an area of active investigation. It is increasingly evident that the combinatorial assembly of these subunits influences substrate specificity, subcellular localization, and responses to pharmacological agents, thereby opening up opportunities for more precise therapeutic interventions that selectively target AMPKα2-containing complexes in specific tissues such as skeletal muscle and liver (mestareehi2021proteinphosphatase2a pages 229-232, ovens2021posttranslationalmodificationsof pages 20-21).\n\nRecent studies also underscore the importance of post-translational modifications—beyond the well-documented phosphorylation of Thr172—in fine-tuning AMPKα2 activity. Modifications including ubiquitination, sumoylation, acetylation, and redox-based modifications are being actively explored for their potential roles in regulating enzyme activity, stability, and interactions with other cellular proteins (ovens2021posttranslationalmodificationsof pages 16-18, mohanty2025rethinkingampka pages 15-16).\n\nIn addition, dysregulation of AMPKα2 has been associated with endocrine resistance in certain breast cancer models as well as with metabolic derangements observed in various disease states. Thus, understanding the nuanced regulatory mechanisms of AMPKα2 and its isoform-specific functions remains a critical area for ongoing research, with the potential to yield novel insights that can be exploited therapeutically in diseases related to energy imbalance (ertefai2016resistancemechanismsduring pages 313-321, mestareehi2021proteinphosphatase2a pages 89-93).\n\n## 9.

    "answer": "1. Phylogeny  \nSerine/threonine‐protein kinase SGK1 is a member of the AGC kinase family, a broadly conserved subgroup of serine/threonine kinases that includes proteins such as protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and AKT. SGK1, together with its homologs SGK2 and SGK3, forms a distinct subfamily that is present in most eukaryotes, indicating that these kinases are part of an ancient evolutionary core (cicenas2022sgk1incancer pages 1-3, lang2020theenigmaticrole pages 2-3). Orthologs of SGK1 have been identified in a wide range of species—from yeast to mammals—underscoring its fundamental role in cell regulation. In mammals, SGK1 is ubiquitously expressed with orthologous genes being conserved across species, which suggests that core functions in ion transport regulation, survival signaling, and stress response have been maintained throughout evolution (cicenas2022sgk1incancer pages 9-10, maestro2020serumandglucocorticoidinduced pages 1-3).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nSGK1 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to serine or threonine residues on its protein substrates. The overall reaction can be written as: ATP + [protein]-(Ser/Thr) → ADP + [protein]-(phospho-Ser/Thr) + H⁺. This phosphorylation is an essential post-translational modification that modulates substrate activity, localization, interaction with other proteins, and stability (jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 1-3, sang2021sgk1inhuman pages 3-4).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of SGK1 is dependent on divalent metal ions, predominantly Mg²⁺, which are required to coordinate the phosphate of ATP in the enzyme’s active site. In addition, the efficiency of its catalytic mechanism depends on ATP as a co-substrate. Although not extensively detailed in some excerpts, it is broadly acknowledged that like other kinases in the AGC family, SGK1 requires these cofactors to achieve proper catalytic turnover (cicenas2022sgk1incancer pages 1-3, maestro2020serumandglucocorticoidinduced pages 3-4).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nSGK1 phosphorylates a wide array of substrates involved in numerous cellular processes, including ion channel regulation, transcription, and survival signaling. Its substrate specificity often depends on the recognition of serine/threonine residues within defined amino acid motifs; numerous studies report that SGK1 phosphorylates targets that harbor motifs such as R-X-R-X-X-(S/T) and related sequences. For example, SGK1 phosphorylates the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) regulatory protein NEDD4L, which in turn modulates the stability of ENaC subunits, and it phosphorylates transcription factors like FOXO1 and FOXO3, leading to their nuclear exclusion (cicenas2022sgk1incancer pages 1-3, jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 3-4, sang2021sgk1inhuman pages 13-14). Additionally, substrates such as NDRG1, MDM2 and proteins involved in the regulation of ion transport and metabolism are targeted by SGK1, reinforcing its role as a multifunctional serine/threonine kinase (cicenas2022sgk1incancer pages 8-9, maestro2020serumandglucocorticoidinduced pages 12-13).\n\n5. Structure  \nSGK1 displays a domain organization that consists of three primary regions: an N-terminal variable region, a central catalytic kinase domain, and a C-terminal tail. The catalytic domain encompasses the ATP binding pocket and several conserved motifs typical of AGC kinases, including essential catalytic residues such as those involved in ATP binding and phosphate transfer. A unique structural attribute of SGK1 is the absence of the lipid-binding pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which differentiates it from kinases such as AKT (cicenas2022sgk1incancer pages 1-3). In some isoforms, the N-terminal region harbors targeting signals including a mitochondrial targeting sequence and may also contain nuclear localization signals that allow dynamic subcellular distribution in response to extracellular stimuli, such as serum or glucocorticoids (maestro2020serumandglucocorticoidinduced pages 11-12, lang2020theenigmaticrole pages 14-14). Although high-resolution crystal structural data are not detailed in every excerpt, homology modeling and co‐crystallization studies have provided insights into the active conformation and inhibitor binding sites, which are crucial for structure-based inhibitor design (jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 8-9, maestro2020serumandglucocorticoidinduced pages 12-13).\n\n6. Regulation  \nSGK1 activity is regulated at multiple levels, beginning with its transcription and continuing through post-translational modifications. Among the best characterized regulatory mechanisms is phosphorylation: SGK1 requires phosphorylation on two key residues for full activation. First, mTORC2 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif at serine 422, inducing a conformational change that facilitates the subsequent phosphorylation of the activation loop residue threonine 256 by PDK1 (cicenas2022sgk1incancer pages 1-3, jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 1-3). In addition to phosphorylation, the expression of SGK1 is tightly controlled by extracellular stimuli, notably glucocorticoids and serum, which trigger transcriptional upregulation via binding of the glucocorticoid receptor and other transcription factors to the SGK1 promoter (jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 3-4, maestro2020serumandglucocorticoidinduced pages 1-3). Moreover, SGK1 protein is rapidly turned over with a relatively short mRNA and protein half-life, and its degradation is mediated by ubiquitination pathways involving E3 ubiquitin ligases such as NEDD4L (cicenas2022sgk1incancer pages 1-3, maestro2020serumandglucocorticoidinduced pages 4-6). Other regulatory factors include second messengers like Ca²⁺, cAMP, reactive oxygen species, and cellular stress signals that further modulate SGK1 activity and localization (lang2020theenigmaticrole pages 1-2, nahar2023theroleof pages 14-19).\n\n7. Function  \nSGK1 plays an extensive role in regulating a variety of cellular functions due to its capacity to phosphorylate many different substrates. A central function of SGK1 is the regulation of ion channels and transporters. For instance, SGK1 enhances epithelial sodium transport by phosphorylating the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4L; this phosphorylation promotes binding with 14-3-3 proteins, thereby preventing NEDD4L-mediated degradation of the ENaC subunit SCNN1A and resulting in increased sodium reabsorption (cicenas2022sgk1incancer pages 1-3, maestro2020serumandglucocorticoidinduced pages 6-7). In addition to modulating ion transport, SGK1 affects the activity and plasma membrane expression of several other channels and transporters such as voltage-gated sodium channels (SCN5A), potassium channels (e.g., KCNJ1/ROMK1, members of the KCNA and KCNQ families), epithelial calcium channels TRPV5/6, chloride channels (including CFTR), glutamate transporters, amino acid transporters, and even the creatine transporter (cicenas2022sgk1incancer pages 1-3, cicenas2022sgk1incancer pages 3-5). Beyond its role in electrolyte homeostasis, SGK1 phosphorylates transcription factors including FOXO1 and FOXO3, leading to their nuclear export and attenuation of apoptosis, while also phosphorylating MDM2 and influencing p53 turnover, which ties into its role in cell survival and proliferation (cicenas2022sgk1incancer pages 8-9, sang2021sgk1inhuman pages 13-14). Furthermore, SGK1 regulates metabolic processes such as glucose transport—by phosphorylating and thereby enhancing the activity of GLUT4—and contributes to insulin-dependent salt sensitivity and peripheral glucose uptake (cicenas2022sgk1incancer pages 3-5, zhou2021serumandglucocorticoidinduced pages 3-5). In neuronal cells, SGK1 phosphorylates MAPT/TAU, affecting microtubule dynamics and neurite outgrowth which is important in memory consolidation (cicenas2022sgk1incancer pages 1-3, lang2020theenigmaticrole pages 14-15). SGK1 also plays a pivotal role in vascular remodeling during angiogenesis and contributes to cellular stress responses such as the modulation of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response and autophagy (jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 16-17, maestro2020serumandglucocorticoidinduced pages 8-10).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nDue to its broad substrate range and central role in various signaling pathways, SGK1 is implicated in a number of disease states. Elevated SGK1 levels and sustained kinase activity have been associated with hypertension, diabetic nephropathy, cardiac hypertrophy, and a spectrum of cancers including colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer. Its influence on drug resistance has been documented in the context of certain malignancies, making it a promising diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target (cicenas2022sgk1incancer pages 5-6, sang2021sgk1inhuman pages 4-6). A number of small-molecule inhibitors targeting SGK1 have been developed in preclinical settings; for example, SI113 and GSK650394 have demonstrated potential in reducing tumor cell proliferation and reversing chemoresistance, although none have yet reached clinical approval owing in part to challenges with kinome selectivity and inhibitor potency (jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 13-14, nahar2023theroleof pages 19-23). In addition, natural compounds such as herbacetin have shown selective SGK1 inhibitory properties with beneficial effects in models of cardiac hypertrophy. Ongoing research continues to expand our understanding of SGK1 regulation by noncoding RNAs, its mutational landscape in tumors, and its interplay with pathways such as PI3K/AKT and mTOR. Given its central role in critical biological processes, SGK1 remains a high-priority target for the development of novel therapeutic agents aimed at conditions ranging from metabolic disorders to advanced cancers (sang2021sgk1inhuman pages 14-14, maestro2020serumandglucocorticoidinduced pages 13-14).\n\n9.

    "answer": "1. Phylogeny  \nTRPM6, formally known as Transient Receptor Potential cation channel subfamily M member 6 or CHAK2, is phylogenetically nested within the TRPM (melastatin) subfamily of the larger TRP (Transient Receptor Potential) channel superfamily. Its evolutionary history is tightly linked to that of TRPM7, with which it shares a high degree of sequence similarity and common domain architecture, including the distinctive C-terminal α‐kinase domain. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that TRPM6 and TRPM7 emerged before the divergence of fish and land vertebrates, over 450 million years ago, thus placing them among evolutionarily conserved channel kinases in the vertebrate lineage (chubanov2005emergingrolesof pages 2-3, chubanov2005emergingrolesof pages 3-5). The kinase domain of TRPM6 is classified as part of the atypical α‐kinase family, a group clearly distinct from conventional serine/threonine kinases; within the kinome, the α‐kinases—including TRPM6 and TRPM7—are characterized by unusual catalytic cores and substrate recognition that preferentially target residues in α‐helical segments (middelbeek2010thealphakinasefamily pages 8-10). Orthologs of TRPM6 have been identified in several vertebrate species, including mammals such as mice and humans and extending to birds and fish, underscoring its conserved physiological importance in magnesium homeostasis (chubanov2005emergingrolesof pages 2-3).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nAs a bifunctional protein, TRPM6 catalyzes two distinct reactions. In its role as an ion channel, TRPM6 facilitates the transmembrane flux of Mg²⁺ and other divalent cations, thereby directly influencing cytosolic magnesium concentrations. In parallel, its intracellular kinase domain catalyzes phosphorylation reactions whereby a phosphate moiety is transferred from ATP to specific serine and threonine residues on target protein substrates, including autophosphorylation of the channel itself and phosphorylation events that may modulate associated proteins such as TRPM7 (chubanov2005emergingrolesof pages 2-3, dorovkov2004phosphorylationofannexin pages 1-1). The general chemical reaction mediated by the kinase domain can be summarized as:  \n  ATP + [protein] – OH → ADP + [protein] – O–PO₃²⁻ + H⁺  \nThis dual reaction mechanism underlies its function as a “chanzyme” – both channel and enzyme – crucial for regulating magnesium absorption in epithelial cells (cai2017massspectrometricanalysis pages 13-13).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nActivation of the kinase function in TRPM6 is dependent on specific cofactors. Like many kinases, TRPM6 requires Mg²⁺ as an essential cofactor to facilitate ATP binding and the phosphoryl transfer reaction (cao2008rack1inhibitstrpm6 pages 8-9). In the context of its ion channel activity, the permeability to Mg²⁺ coupled with regulation by intracellular concentrations of Mg²⁺ and Mg·ATP further underscores the dual sensitivity of TRPM6 to magnesium ions. Although Mn²⁺ could substitute in some phosphorylation reactions in other kinases, current data indicate that TRPM6 is highly specific for Mg²⁺ in both its channel and kinase activities (chubanov2005emergingrolesof pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nThe substrate specificity of TRPM6’s kinase domain is determined by its classification within the atypical α‐kinase family. This group is known to phosphorylate serine and threonine residues, most notably within α‑helical regions of target proteins rather than in flexible loops typical of conventional kinases. Although our current literature does not enumerate an extensive list of physiological substrates, evidence suggests that TRPM6 shares overlapping substrate specificity with its close relative TRPM7. Studies have demonstrated phosphorylation events that modulate channel trafficking and activity, and there is support for phosphorylation of myosin II isoforms as a potential substrate in related systems (clark2008theα‐kinasestrpm6 pages 4-5, runnels2011trpm6andtrpm7 pages 2-3). In general, the consensus reaction involves the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to hydroxyl groups on serine/threonine residues in substrates that may contain structural elements (such as α-helical domains) that permit binding by the unique catalytic site of TRPM6 (schmitz2005thechannelkinases pages 3-4).\n\n5. Structure  \nTRPM6 is characterized by a complex, multidomain architecture reflective of its bifunctional roles. At the N-terminus, TRPM6 contains regions typical of TRP channels including a long N-terminal cytosolic domain that often includes a coiled-coil region implicated in channel assembly. This is followed by six predicted transmembrane segments (S1–S6) that constitute the ion channel pore, with a pore loop located between S5 and S6 that confers selectivity for Mg²⁺ and Ca²⁺ (chubanov2005emergingrolesof pages 1-2, nilius2011thetransientreceptor pages 1-2). A conserved TRP box motif is typically found in the C-terminal tail near the transmembrane domain, and this region is critical for channel gating. The most distinctive feature of TRPM6 is its large intracellular C-terminal extension containing a catalytic α-kinase domain that bears structural similarity to that found in TRPM7. This kinase domain is flanked by regulatory regions that are subject to autophosphorylation and may serve to modulate the enzyme’s activity (middelbeek2010thealphakinasefamily pages 7-8, cai2017massspectrometricanalysis pages 13-13). Structural studies, including crystallographic analyses of the homologous TRPM7 kinase domain, support that TRPM6’s kinase fold comprises a conserved N-terminal lobe with a phosphate-binding P-loop and a C-terminal lobe that forms the substrate binding pocket. Key catalytic residues required for ATP binding and phosphoryl transfer are conserved, ensuring proper kinase function (chubanov2005emergingrolesof pages 3-5, schmitz2005thechannelkinases pages 8-9).\n\n6. Regulation  \nRegulation of TRPM6 occurs at several levels, integrating both its channel and kinase functionalities. Autophosphorylation within its C-terminal kinase domain is a critical regulatory mechanism; specific residues, such as threonine 1851, have been identified as key autophosphorylation sites that influence channel activity and sensitivity to intracellular Mg²⁺ inhibition (cao2008rack1inhibitstrpm6 pages 8-9). In addition, protein–protein interactions play a significant regulatory role. For instance, the scaffolding protein RACK1 has been shown to interact with the α-kinase domain of TRPM6, thereby inhibiting its activity through modulation of phosphorylation state (cao2008rack1inhibitstrpm6 pages 8-9). Furthermore, while the precise mechanism controlling the switch between its channel and kinase activities remains under active investigation, there is evidence that TRPM6 requires association with TRPM7 for efficient trafficking to the plasma membrane and that heteromerization influences both gating and enzymatic function (chubanov2005emergingrolesof pages 1-2, runnels2011trpm6andtrpm7 pages 4-5). Modulation by intracellular levels of Mg²⁺ and Mg·ATP also contributes to the fine-tuning of TRPM6 activity, acting as a feedback signal to regulate the extent of both ion permeation and kinase-driven phosphorylation events (nilius2011thetransientreceptor pages 2-4).\n\n7. Function  \nThe biological role of TRPM6 is central to magnesium homeostasis in vertebrate organisms. Primarily expressed in epithelial cells of the renal distal convoluted tubule and the intestinal brush border, TRPM6 underpins active magnesium absorption—a process critical for maintaining cellular and systemic Mg²⁺ balance (voets2004trpm6formsthe pages 1-1, walder2002mutationoftrpm6 pages 2-3). Loss-of-function mutations in TRPM6 lead to familial hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia, a severe autosomal recessive disorder underscoring the protein’s physiological importance (walder2002mutationoftrpm6 pages 2-3). Beyond its channel function, the α-kinase domain of TRPM6 is implicated in intracellular signaling pathways through its capacity to phosphorylate specific downstream substrates. This dual functional capacity positions TRPM6 as a “chanzyme” that not only facilitates Mg²⁺ entry into cells but also modulates cellular processes via phosphorylation. The functional interplay between TRPM6 and TRPM7, with evidence supporting the formation of heteromeric complexes, may further fine-tune magnesium transport and intracellular signaling in response to environmental and metabolic cues (chubanov2005emergingrolesof pages 3-5, runnels2011trpm6andtrpm7 pages 1-2). The expression of TRPM6 is tissue-specific, and its activity is tightly regulated to ensure appropriate magnesium uptake in organs critical for electrolyte balance, ultimately influencing processes such as enzyme activity, signal transduction, and cellular metabolism (dorovkov2004phosphorylationofannexin pages 1-1).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nTRPM6 is of considerable clinical interest due to its direct involvement in hereditary disorders of magnesium homeostasis. Mutations in the TRPM6 gene are genetically linked to hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia, providing a clear link between channel-kinase dysfunction and disease (walder2002mutationoftrpm6 pages 2-3). Despite extensive research, the debate continues over whether TRPM6 can form fully functional homomeric channels on its own or whether its primary physiological role is as a subunit within heteromeric TRPM6-TRPM7 complexes (chubanov2005emergingrolesof pages 1-2, runnels2011trpm6andtrpm7 pages 2-3). This controversy further emphasizes the importance of precise regulatory mechanisms that govern both its ion channel and kinase activities. Ongoing studies are directed at elucidating the complete substrate repertoire of the TRPM6 kinase domain and deciphering the exact molecular mechanisms by which its phosphorylation events impact downstream signaling pathways. Inhibitor development targeting TRPM6 is also an area of active research, with the potential to modulate magnesium absorption in disease states; however, the dual functionality of TRPM6 complicates the development of highly specific inhibitors that can differentially affect its channel versus kinase activities (cao2008rack1inhibitstrpm6 pages 8-9). Furthermore, current research focuses on determining how phosphorylation of specific residues influences channel trafficking and gating, which may ultimately reveal novel therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of magnesium-related disorders (ferioli2017trpm6andtrpm7 pages 1-2).\n\n9.

Phylogeny  \nTRPM7 belongs to the transient receptor potential melastatin (TRPM) subfamily of ion channels and is evolutionarily conserved across vertebrates, with orthologs identifiable in mammals, birds, amphibians, and fish (cai2018thefunctionalinterplay pages 8-12, luo2024trpm7inneurodevelopment pages 2-3). It shares a close evolutionary relationship with TRPM6, another channel‐kinase that arose early in vertebrate evolution approximately 450 million years ago, indicating that both proteins emerged before the divergence of fish and land vertebrates (gao2022palmitoylationandregulationa pages 49-53, beesetty2018consequencesoftrpm7 pages 27-32). Phylogenetically, TRPM7 is classified within an atypical branch of serine/threonine kinases, the so‐called “α-kinases,” which are evolutionarily distinct from classical protein kinases and are found ubiquitously in eukaryotes (cai2018thefunctionalinterplay pages 12-16, schmucker2023regulatorymechanismsof pages 14-18).\n\n2.

In addition to autophosphorylation of its own serine/threonine-rich region—a process that modulates its protein stability and trafficking—TRPM7 phosphorylates several downstream targets (e.g., annexin A1, myosin II isoforms and SMAD2), thereby linking ion conduction with intracellular signaling events that influence processes such as cell motility, differentiation, and immune function (beesetty2018consequencesoftrpm7 pages 27-32, cai2018thefunctionalinterplay pages 118-121).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe phosphotransferase activity of the TRPM7 kinase domain is strictly dependent on divalent cations, most notably Mg²⁺, which serves both as a cofactor for the kinase catalytic process and as a regulator for the ion channel domain (zou2019trpm7magnesiumand pages 1-3, turlova2018cellularandmolecular pages 51-54). The activity is further modulated by Mg-ATP complexes, with intracellular Mg²⁺ and Mg-ATP levels critically determining both channel gating and kinase activity (chubanov2020mappingtrpm7function pages 1-3, gav2022palmitoylationandregulation pages 46-49). In some experimental systems, additional metal ions such as Mn²⁺ or Zn²⁺ can support or modulate kinase activity; however, Mg²⁺ is the predominant cofactor in physiological contexts (cai2017massspectrometricanalysis pages 1-3, beesetty2018consequencesoftrpm7 pages 16-23).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nTRPM7 exhibits a broad substrate specificity typical of atypical α-kinases, phosphorylating serine/threonine residues within structured α-helical regions rather than the canonical motifs recognized by classical kinases (cai2017massspectrometricanalysis pages 3-3, beesetty2018consequencesoftrpm7 pages 23-27). Known physiological substrates include SMAD2, which links TRPM7 activity to TGF-β signaling cascades, as well as annexin A1 and various isoforms of myosin II, which underline its role in cytoskeletal rearrangements and cell motility (beesetty2018consequencesoftrpm7 pages 27-32, cai2018thefunctionalinterplay pages 118-121). Although a consensus phosphorylation motif for TRPM7 has not been as clearly defined as for classical serine/threonine kinases, its substrate recognition appears to depend on specific structural features within the target proteins that allow binding and correct positioning in the active site of the kinase domain (cai2017massspectrometricanalysis pages 13-13, schmucker2023regulatorymechanismsofc pages 14-18).\n\n5. Structure  \nTRPM7 is a bifunctional protein with a complex domain organization that integrates both ion channel and kinase functionalities. The N-terminal region consists of several melastatin homology regions (MHRs) that play roles in channel trafficking and possibly in establishing subunit interactions (cai2018thefunctionalinterplay pages 8-12, beesetty2018consequencesoftrpm7 pages 16-23). This is followed by six transmembrane segments (S1–S6) that together form the ion channel pore, with the loop between S5 and S6 conferring selectivity to divalent cations such as Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, and Zn²⁺ (chubanov2020mappingtrpm7function pages 1-3, turlova2018cellularandmolecular pages 51-54). Adjacent to the pore, a conserved TRP domain contributes to the channel’s gating properties, particularly in response to intracellular Mg²⁺ and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) levels (gao2022palmitoylationandregulation pages 58-62). C-terminal to the transmembrane region lies a coiled-coil domain that is critical for tetramerization and proper assembly of the channel complex (solivio2024characterizingtherole pages 22-26, stadlbauer2023theroleof pages 18-22). Finally, the C-terminal region houses the α-kinase domain, which is atypical in structure relative to conventional kinases; it contains unique features such as an ATP-grasp fold and serine/threonine-rich autophosphorylation sites that are crucial for modulating its enzymatic activity and, indirectly, the channel’s function (gao2022palmitoylationandregulationa pages 53-58, cai2017massspectrometricanalysis pages 1-3). Key catalytic residues within the kinase domain, including those involved in binding Mg²⁺ and ATP, are essential for phosphotransferase activity, while additional residues contribute to dimerization and regulatory autophosphorylation (cai2017massspectrometricanalysis pages 13-13, beesetty2018consequencesoftrpm7 pages 27-32).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe activity of TRPM7 is intricately regulated by multiple mechanisms acting on both its ion channel and kinase domains. Intracellular Mg²⁺ and Mg-ATP serve as negative regulators for channel gating, forming a feedback loop that adjusts ion flux in response to cellular metabolic status (turlova2018cellularandmolecular pages 51-54, zou2019trpm7magnesiumand pages 1-3). In addition, the kinase domain undergoes extensive autophosphorylation at serine/threonine-rich regions; specific phosphorylation events, such as those at residues S1360 and S1403, have been shown to modulate channel stability by affecting interactions with proteins like 14-3-3θ, thereby influencing intracellular trafficking and degradation (cai2018thefunctionalinterplay pages 114-118, beesetty2018consequencesoftrpm7 pages 23-27). Furthermore, regulatory inputs include modulation by PIP2 levels: hydrolysis of PIP2 via receptor-mediated activation of phospholipase C lowers channel activity, particularly under conditions of low intracellular Mg²⁺, while mechanical stimuli and extracellular pH shifts can also impact channel conductance (chubanov2020mappingtrpm7function pages 1-3, schmucker2023regulatorymechanismsofc pages 9-14). Additional regulation occurs via protein–protein interactions with modulatory partners such as ARL15 and CNNMs, which selectively suppress either channel or kinase activity without necessarily affecting the other domain (bousova2023interactionofcalmodulin pages 11-12, solivio2024characterizingtheroleb pages 22-26).\n\n7. Function  \nAs a bifunctional protein, TRPM7 plays critical roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Its ion channel activity regulates the influx of divalent cations (Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Zn²⁺), which is fundamental for processes such as embryonic development, cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation (beesetty2018consequencesoftrpm7 pages 16-23, zou2019trpm7magnesiumand pages 1-3). Moreover, TRPM7’s kinase domain contributes to cellular signaling by phosphorylating downstream targets such as SMAD2, which implicates TRPM7 in TGF-β signaling and gene regulation, and by modifying proteins involved in cytoskeletal dynamics (e.g., annexin A1, myosin II isoforms) (beesetty2018consequencesoftrpm7 pages 23-27, cai2018thefunctionalinterplay pages 118-121). In immune cells, TRPM7 is essential for proper lymphocyte function, influencing B cell receptor (BCR) signaling and actin cytoskeletal rearrangements that govern antigen processing and cell migration (solivio2024characterizingtherolea pages 26-32, preez2021potentialimplicationsof pages 2-4). Additionally, by controlling intracellular Mg²⁺ levels, TRPM7 regulates a spectrum of cellular activities including cell cycle progression and survival, and disruptions in its function have been associated with pathologies ranging from metabolic disorders to cancer (beesetty2018consequencesoftrpm7 pages 16-23, schmucker2023regulatorymechanismsofb pages 90-92). Its dual role as both an ion channel and kinase thus positions TRPM7 as a central integrator of ion homeostasis and phosphorylation-mediated signal transduction.\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral small molecules have been identified as modulators of TRPM7 activity. For instance, TG100-115 is noted as an inhibitor of the TRPM7 kinase activity with an IC₅₀ in the low micromolar range; additionally, activators such as naltriben have been reported to stimulate channel function even under conditions where intracellular Mg²⁺ concentrations are high (chubanov2017assessmentoftrpm7 pages 6-6, zou2020regulationofthe pages 33-36). Mutations such as S1107E in the TRP domain have been observed to produce a constitutively active channel, emphasizing the structural determinants critical for gating and regulation (turlova2018cellularandmolecular pages 51-54, beesetty2018consequencesoftrpm7 pages 27-32). Pathologically, dysregulated TRPM7 expression or function has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer (with overexpression correlating with tumor grade and metastasis), cardiovascular disorders such as hypertension owing to altered vascular smooth muscle function, and neurological conditions related to abnormal Ca²⁺ influx (gao2022palmitoylationandregulation pages 58-62, preez2021potentialimplicationsof pages 2-4). Ongoing research efforts are focused on dissecting the interplay between the channel and kinase activities to develop more selective inhibitors that may serve therapeutic purposes. Current studies utilizing kinase-dead knock-in models continue to clarify the relative contributions of channel versus kinase functions in both development and disease (schmucker2023regulatorymechanismsofd pages 90-92, solivio2024characterizingtheroleb pages 26-32).\n\n9.

    "answer": "## 1. Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase BTK, commonly known as Bruton tyrosine kinase, belongs to the Tec family of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases and is evolutionarily conserved across vertebrates (alu2022btkinhibitorsin pages 1-3). Within the kinome, BTK groups with other Tec kinases—including ITK, TEC, BMX, and TXK—which share a common domain architecture, suggesting that BTK evolved from an ancestral Tec family kinase present in early metazoans (zain2021structurefunctionrelationshipsof pages 1-2, duarte2020btksh2kinaseinterface pages 1-5). Orthologs of BTK have been identified in various mammalian species, indicating its essential and conserved role in immune function, and its evolutionary conservation is underscored by the persistence of key catalytic and regulatory residues such as the active‐site cysteine (alu2022btkinhibitorsin pages 1-3, zain2021structurefunctionrelationshipsof pages 1-2).\n\n## 2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nBTK catalyzes the transfer of the gamma phosphate group from ATP to specific tyrosine residues on substrate proteins, a classic phosphorylation reaction that produces ADP and a phosphotyrosine-modified substrate (joseph2020differentialimpactof pages 1-2). In the context of B-cell receptor signaling, one of its best-characterized reactions is the phosphorylation of phospholipase C gamma 2 (PLCG2) at multiple tyrosine sites, which subsequently drives calcium mobilization and downstream activation of protein kinase C family members (alu2022btkinhibitorsin pages 3-5). This phosphorylation reaction, typical of tyrosine kinases, is central to the propagation of signals initiated by antigen binding and is vital for B lymphocyte activation and subsequent cellular responses (mcdonald2021theroleof pages 1-2).\n\n## 3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of BTK is dependent on ATP as the phosphate donor, and this enzymatic process requires a divalent metal ion—commonly Mg²⁺—to coordinate the binding of ATP and facilitate the phosphoryl transfer (lin2023structureofbtk pages 2-4). In addition to Mg²⁺, structural studies imply that appropriate membrane lipids such as phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) are critical for the recruitment of BTK to the plasma membrane via its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, thereby indirectly influencing its catalytic efficiency (alu2022btkinhibitorsin pages 3-5, messex2021targetingbtksignaling pages 6-7).\n\n## 4. Substrate Specificity  \nBTK exhibits a high degree of substrate specificity by phosphorylating key substrates that include PLCγ2, which is essential for mediating calcium flux in B cells following B-cell receptor (BCR) engagement (alu2022btkinhibitorsin pages 3-5, joseph2020differentialimpactof pages 25-26). The enzyme does not recognize a broad amino acid motif in the same way that serine/threonine kinases might; rather, its specificity is determined by both the spatial conformation of the substrate and the formation of docking complexes with adaptor proteins such as BLNK, which facilitates correct substrate presentation (joseph2020differentialimpactof pages 2-4, mcdonald2021theroleof pages 25-28). In addition to PLCγ2, BTK substrates extend to proteins involved in Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, such as TIRAP, and even to molecules that participate in the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome, further emphasizing its role in both adaptive and innate immune responses (OpenTargets Search: -BTK).\n\n## 5. Structure  \nBTK comprises a modular domain architecture that underpins its multifunctional role in immune signaling. The protein contains an N-terminal Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domain that mediates binding to phosphoinositide lipids at the plasma membrane and is essential for proper subcellular localization (alu2022btkinhibitorsin pages 3-5, messex2021targetingbtksignaling pages 4-6). Immediately following the PH domain is a Tec Homology (TH) region that contains a proline-rich segment and zinc finger motif, contributing to the protein’s stability and potential intermolecular interactions (alu2022btkinhibitorsin pages 3-5). BTK also harbors an SH3 domain that facilitates interactions with proline-rich regions in binding partners and an SH2 domain that binds phosphotyrosine motifs, offering a means for assembling multi-protein complexes and mediating autoinhibitory contacts (zain2021structurefunctionrelationshipsof pages 1-2, alu2022btkinhibitorsin pages 3-5). The C-terminal kinase (SH1) domain is responsible for the catalytic activity of BTK, with key residues such as Y551, whose phosphorylation leads to activation, and C481, which serves as the covalent binding site for clinically approved BTK inhibitors (alu2022btkinhibitorsin pages 3-5, lin2023structureofbtk pages 11-12, joseph2020differentialimpactof pages 27-27). High-resolution crystal structures and AlphaFold models have provided significant insights into these domains, confirming the overall fold typical for tyrosine kinases and revealing subtle conformational changes that regulate kinase activity and inhibitor binding (lin2023structureofbtk pages 2-4, joseph2020differentialimpactof pages 25-26).\n\n## 6. Regulation  \nBTK is regulated through multiple, interdependent mechanisms that include phosphorylation, protein–protein interactions, and subcellular localization changes. Upon B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) engagement, upstream kinases such as SYK or Src family kinases phosphorylate BTK at Y551 within the kinase domain, which then triggers autophosphorylation at Y223 in the SH3 domain, a modification necessary for full catalytic activation (alu2022btkinhibitorsin pages 3-5, joseph2020differentialimpactof pages 1-2). Additionally, the binding of PIP3 to the PH domain is critical for membrane localization and subsequent activation of BTK, linking lipid signaling to kinase regulation (messex2021targetingbtksignaling pages 6-7, lin2023structureofbtk pages 2-4). BTK also acts as a platform for assembling signaling complexes, and its interactions with adaptor proteins like BLNK facilitate substrate recognition and feedback regulation (joseph2020differentialimpactof pages 2-4, mcdonald2021theroleof pages 15-17). In terms of negative regulation, BTK can be modulated by phosphatases and by post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination that lead to its degradation, although detailed mechanisms in these contexts remain an area of active research (alu2022btkinhibitorsin pages 25-26, eisen2025conditionalrequirementfor pages 26-28).\n\n## 7. Function  \nBTK is indispensable for the development, differentiation, and signaling of B lymphocytes. Its activation following antigen binding to the B-cell receptor initiates a cascade that results in the phosphorylation of PLCγ2, subsequent calcium mobilization, and the activation of downstream effectors including protein kinase C, ultimately leading to B-cell activation, proliferation, and survival (OpenTargets Search: -BTK, mcdonald2021theroleof pages 1-2). Beyond its canonical role in adaptive immunity, BTK is implicated in the regulation of innate immune responses; it participates in Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways where it phosphorylates TIRAP leading to its degradation, thereby modulating the inflammatory response and pathogen surveillance (mcdonald2021theroleof pages 22-25, OpenTargets Search: -BTK). Moreover, BTK has been shown to play a part in transcriptional regulation by stimulating NF-κB activity and by transiently phosphorylating transcription factors such as GTF2I, which then translocate to the nucleus to influence gene expression (mcdonald2021theroleof pages 1-2, OpenTargets Search: -BTK). BTK is furthermore involved in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome via phosphorylation of NLRP3, highlighting its dual role in immune signaling and inflammatory responses (OpenTargets Search: -BTK). Expressed primarily in B cells and to a lesser extent in myeloid cells, its proper function is critical for normal immune development, whereas mutations or dysregulation of BTK can lead to immunodeficiency disorders such as X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) and contribute to the pathology of B-cell malignancies (alu2022btkinhibitorsin pages 1-3, zain2021structurefunctionrelationshipsof pages 7-9).\n\n## 8. Other Comments  \nClinically, BTK is a validated and highly pursued therapeutic target; several inhibitors have been developed that target its kinase domain by covalently binding to the C481 residue, with ibrutinib being the prototypical example (estupinan2021btkgatekeeperresidue pages 12-13, tasso2021thedevelopmentof pages 26-28). Second-generation inhibitors such as acalabrutinib, zanubrutinib, tirabrutinib, and the reversible BTK inhibitor pirtobrutinib have been developed to improve selectivity and overcome resistance often conferred by mutations such as C481S (naeem2023pirtobrutinibtargetsbtk pages 14-15, joseph2024impactofthe pages 26-27). BTK inhibitors have not only revolutionized the treatment of B-cell malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and Waldenström macroglobulinemia, but there is also increasing interest in their utility for autoimmune disorders and inflammatory diseases owing to BTK’s role in TLR signaling and innate immunity (mcdonald2021theroleof pages 17-22, ringheim2021bruton’styrosinekinase pages 1-2). Notably, resistance mutations—both within the kinase domain (e.g., at residues C481, T474) and in downstream effectors—pose significant clinical challenges and continue to drive research into next-generation BTK inhibitors and combination therapies (estupinan2021btkgatekeeperresidue pages 12-13, joseph2020differentialimpactof pages 27-27). Furthermore, BTK’s emerging roles in transcriptional regulation, such as its influence on NF-κB and its indirect effects on apoptosis and interferon response via STING1-mediated pathways, highlight additional dimensions of its biological impact that are under active investigation (OpenTargets Search: -BTK, mcdonald2021theroleof pages 1-2). Consequently, BTK remains a focal point in translational research aimed at improving therapies for immunodeficiency, leukemia, lymphoma, and inflammatory diseases (alu2022btkinhibitorsin pages 27-28, messex2021targetingbtksignaling pages 6-7).\n\n## 9.

    "answer": "## 1. Phylogeny  \nABL1 is a non‐receptor tyrosine‐protein kinase that belongs to the Abl family within the broader group of cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases (NRTKs). Phylogenetically, ABL1 is closely related to ABL2 and exhibits significant sequence and functional conservation with other members of the Src and Abl kinase groups. Its kinase domain shares the canonical bilobal fold found in eukaryotic protein kinases, and it is characterized by the presence of regulatory SH2 and SH3 domains that mediate intramolecular interactions governing its activity. Unlike the Src family kinases that contain a C-terminal inhibitory tyrosine, the ABL kinases are regulated by a unique N-terminal myristoylated cap that enforces an autoinhibited conformation. This domain architecture is evolutionarily conserved across metazoans, and orthologs of ABL1 can be identified in a wide range of vertebrate species, reflecting its emergence early in the evolution of multicellular eukaryotes. Comparative studies using yeast as a heterologous expression system have demonstrated conserved kinase‐substrate relationships that underscore the evolutionary retention of substrate recognition motifs in Abl family kinases (corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 13-16, janaki2020unityanddiversity pages 15-18).\n\n## 2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nABL1 catalyzes the transfer of the γ‐phosphate from ATP to specific tyrosine residues on substrate proteins. The general reaction can be summarized as: ATP + protein (with an available tyrosine hydroxyl group) → ADP + phospho-protein + H⁺. This phosphorylation event modulates target protein activity, thereby altering downstream signaling pathways that regulate processes such as cytoskeleton remodeling, cell adhesion, and DNA damage response. Although the detailed kinetic mechanism has not been exhaustively dissected in every substrate system, it is generally accepted that the reaction follows a bi-bi sequential mechanism typical of protein kinases, with binding of ATP and the substrate protein followed by phosphoryl transfer that is facilitated by a conserved catalytic base in the active site (fabbro2015tenthingsyou pages 2-4).\n\n## 3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of ABL1 is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions, most notably Mg²⁺. The Mg²⁺ ion is essential for proper positioning and stabilization of the ATP molecule within the active site, thereby facilitating an efficient phosphoryl transfer reaction. In many protein kinases, including ABL1, the presence of Mg²⁺ is an absolute requirement, and in some cellular contexts Mn²⁺ may partially substitute for Mg²⁺ although with altered kinetics. This cofactor dependency is a conserved characteristic among eukaryotic protein kinases and is critical for achieving optimal catalytic turnover (fabbro2015tenthingsyou pages 4-5).\n\n## 4. Substrate Specificity  \nABL1 phosphorylates a wide repertoire of substrates involved in diverse cellular processes. Its substrate specificity is defined by linear amino acid sequence motifs surrounding the target tyrosine residues. Experimental evidence derived from yeast-based phosphoproteomics has revealed that Abl family kinases preferentially phosphorylate substrates featuring proline at the +3 position relative to the phosphoacceptor site and aliphatic residues (such as valine, leucine, or isoleucine) at the –1 position. Additional preferences include the presence of negatively charged residues at positions –3, –4, and +1 relative to the tyrosine, thus creating a substrate environment conducive to selective recognition. Though much of the detailed motif data has been derived from studies of the ABL2 kinase, the close evolutionary relationship between ABL1 and ABL2 suggests that similar substrate recognition principles extend to ABL1. Physiologically, ABL1 targets proteins that play key roles in actin dynamics (e.g., WASF3), adaptor protein signaling (e.g., CRK and CRKL), receptor endocytosis (e.g., CBL and RIN1), and DNA repair processes (e.g., RAD51 and TP73). This broad substrate specificity and the conservation of linear motifs across yeast and human orthologs emphasize the evolutionary fine-tuning of Abl kinase substrate modules (corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 126-130, janaki2020unityanddiversity pages 40-54).\n\n## 5. Structure  \nABL1 exhibits the classic bi-lobal kinase fold present in eukaryotic protein kinases, comprising a smaller N-terminal lobe predominantly formed by β-sheets and a larger C-terminal lobe consisting mainly of α-helices. The N-terminal region includes a myristoylated cap that is unique to the Abl family, contributing to autoinhibition by docking into a specific pocket in the kinase domain, thereby stabilizing the inactive conformation. In addition to the kinase core, ABL1 contains regulatory modular domains such as an SH3 domain, which typically mediates the binding of proline-rich motifs, and an SH2 domain, which binds phosphotyrosine-containing regions. The juxtaposition of these domains creates an intramolecular network that is critically involved in the regulation of kinase activity. Structural studies using crystal structures and molecular replacement approaches have detailed the active versus inactive conformations of the kinase domain, highlighting conserved elements such as the activation loop (A-loop), the DFG motif, and the hydrophobic spines (R-spine and C-spine) that are essential in dynamic allosteric regulation. Key catalytic residues, including those in the catalytic loop and the αC-helix, are optimally arranged in the active state, and mutations in these regions (e.g., the gatekeeper mutation T315I) have been shown to confer resistance to therapeutic inhibitors. The overall architecture of ABL1 underscores its evolutionary conservation among tyrosine kinases and parallels many of the structural features described in related members of the tyrosine kinase superfamily (kornev2015dynamicsdrivenallosteryin pages 6-7, mcskimming2017classifyingkinaseconformations pages 8-10, tse2015moleculardeterminantsunderlying pages 32-34).\n\n## 6. Regulation  \nThe catalytic activity of ABL1 is tightly regulated by multiple mechanisms that integrate intramolecular interactions with post-translational modifications. Autoinhibition is a hallmark of its regulation, where the N-terminal myristoylated cap, in combination with the SH2 and SH3 domains, maintains the kinase in an inactive conformation under basal conditions. Relief of autoinhibition typically occurs through conformational changes triggered by binding of substrates or regulatory proteins, or by phosphorylation events. ABL1 is known to autophosphorylate on specific tyrosine residues within the activation loop, which helps stabilize the active conformation and promote substrate binding. Moreover, regulatory interactions with inhibitor proteins such as ABI1 modulate ABL1 activity via additional phosphorylation events that can either enhance or suppress kinase activity. In response to cellular stress, such as DNA damage or oxidative stress, ABL1 can translocate to the nucleus where additional regulatory modifications take place to govern roles in DNA repair and apoptosis. Intermolecular phosphorylation by upstream kinases or changes in cellular redox states further contribute to the fine-tuning of its signaling output. This complex regulatory scheme, involving both autophosphorylation and cross-talk with other signaling networks, is an evolutionarily conserved feature that has been elucidated through integrative studies in yeast and higher eukaryotes (corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 152-155, corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 149-152).\n\n## 7. Function  \nABL1 serves as a critical signaling node, orchestrating a variety of cellular processes that are central to cell growth, survival, and response to extracellular stimuli. Functionally, ABL1 modulates cytoskeletal dynamics by phosphorylating regulatory proteins such as WASF3, which is essential for lamellipodia formation and cellular migration, as well as other regulators involved in actin cytoskeleton remodeling. Through the phosphorylation of adaptors such as CRK and CRKL, ABL1 integrates signals from multiple receptors to control cell adhesion and motility. Besides its prominent cytoplasmic functions, ABL1 also plays significant roles in receptor endocytosis by phosphorylating components like CBL and RIN1, which are involved in receptor down-regulation and trafficking. Upon DNA damage or in response to oxidative stress, ABL1 translocates to the nucleus where it participates in the DNA damage response by phosphorylating substrates such as RAD51, TP73, and components of the repair machinery, thereby contributing to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis when damage is irreparable. Additionally, ABL1 can influence mitochondrial dynamics and autophagy, further underscoring its diverse roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis. These activities are supported by an extensive network of substrates that not only regulate cellular architecture but also control key transcriptional and apoptotic pathways. The multifunctional nature of ABL1 highlights its importance in both normal physiological contexts and in pathological conditions such as oncogenesis, where aberrant activity driven by gene fusions (e.g., BCR-ABL in chronic myelogenous leukemia) leads to uncontrolled cell proliferation (corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 155-173, corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 97-100).\n\n## 8. Other Comments  \nGiven its central role in cellular signaling, ABL1 is a major target of therapeutic intervention, particularly in the context of leukemias where the BCR-ABL fusion protein is a well-established driver of malignancy. Inhibitors such as imatinib and dasatinib have been developed to target the aberrant kinase activity of BCR-ABL and have achieved notable clinical success. In addition to its roles in cancer, ABL1 is implicated in the regulation of immune cell function and has been linked to pathogen-host interactions whereby certain microbial proteins are phosphorylated by ABL1 to facilitate infection. Mutations and polymorphisms within the ABL1 gene can alter its kinase activity and substrate specificity, thereby impacting disease progression and treatment response. Current research continues to explore the intricate regulation of ABL1, its broad substrate spectrum, and the development of next-generation inhibitors that overcome resistance mechanisms such as the T315I mutation. These advances are supported by structural insights that detail the conformational dynamics of the kinase domain and by proteomic studies that delineate its signaling networks. Resources such as the Chemical Probes portal and the KLIFS database are valuable for comparing the efficacy of ABL1 inhibitors and for revealing new aspects of its regulation and function (OpenTargets Search: -ABL1, janaki2020unityanddiversity pages 15-18, bokhari2022…oflung pages 37-41).\n\n## 9.

    "answer": "1. Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase ABL2 (also known as ARG) is a member of the Abelson (ABL) family, a subgroup of the non‐receptor tyrosine kinases. ABL2 shares high sequence conservation in its N‐terminal region (comprising SH3, SH2, and kinase domains) with ABL1, indicating a gene duplication event in vertebrates that generated two paralogs within the ABL family (khatri2018theroleof pages 16-21, mayro2022thecharacterizationofa pages 17-24). This kinase is evolutionarily conserved across metazoans, with orthologs present in organisms ranging from invertebrates to mammals, suggesting that the ABL family originated early in eukaryotic evolution (corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmica pages 13-16, siveen2018roleofnon pages 2-4). Phylogenetically, ABL2 belongs to a kinome group that is distinct from receptor tyrosine kinases and shares regulatory features with other non‐receptor kinases such as the Src family, although it lacks some of the regulatory C‐terminal residues present in Src proteins (khatri2018theroleof pages 135-138, laszlo2019structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nABL2 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the hydroxyl group of tyrosine residues on protein substrates. The generalized chemical reaction is:  \n  ATP + [protein]-Tyr → ADP + [protein]-Tyr-phosphate + H⁺  \nThis phosphorylation event induces a conformational or functional change in the substrate, thereby modulating protein–protein interactions and the activity of signaling pathways (azevedo2019nonreceptortyrosinekinases pages 1-3, siveen2018roleofnon pages 2-4). Although precise details regarding the catalytic mechanism of ABL2 have not been fully elaborated in the present texts, it is generally accepted that the ABL kinases utilize a similar bi–bi mechanism as other protein kinases, wherein nucleotide binding and catalytic base–assisted deprotonation of the tyrosine hydroxyl group are key steps (arrington2019identificationofthe pages 8-9).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nLike most protein kinases, ABL2 requires divalent metal ions for its catalytic activity, with Mg²⁺ serving as the primary cofactor. Mg²⁺ ions coordinate to ATP, facilitating the correct positioning of the nucleotide for phosphate transfer (azevedo2019nonreceptortyrosinekinases pages 1-3). No alternative cofactors have been explicitly reported in the provided literature, but the dependence on Mg²⁺ is consistent with the canonical requirements of tyrosine kinases (siveen2018roleofnon pages 2-4).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nThe substrate specificity of ABL2 is partially overlapping with that of ABL1; both kinases target proteins that influence cytoskeletal dynamics and receptor signaling. ABL2 phosphorylates a diverse range of substrates involved in actin remodeling and microtubule dynamics. Key physiological substrates include:  \n • MYH10 – a non–muscle myosin involved in cellular movement;  \n • CTTN (cortactin), which regulates actin dynamics and cellular signaling;  \n • TUBA1 and TUBB – subunits of microtubules required for appropriate cytoskeletal organization;  \n • Adaptor proteins CRK and CRKL, which serve as molecular linkers in multiple signal transduction pathways;  \n • DOK1 and ARHGAP35 – regulators of cell adhesion and motility – whose phosphorylation modulates their interaction with RASA1 leading to local inhibition of RHO GTPases (information section, khatri2018theroleof pages 135-138, hoj2020thecharacterizationofa pages 31-37).  \nAdditionally, ABL2 phosphorylates receptor tyrosine kinases like PDGFRB and endocytosis regulators such as RIN1, extending its impact to receptor internalization processes (arrington2019identificationofthe pages 8-9, khatri2018theroleof pages 27-32). Although a precise consensus motif for ABL2 substrates is not specified in the provided context, the kinase is known to recognize target tyrosine residues that are embedded in specific local structural contexts which can include docking motifs recognized by its own SH2 domain (mayro2022thecharacterizationof pages 29-34, siveen2018roleofnon pages 2-4).\n\n5. Structure  \nABL2 exhibits a modular domain architecture common to the ABL family. The N-terminal portion comprises an SH3 domain—which mediates binding to proline-rich motifs—an SH2 domain that recognizes phosphotyrosine-containing sequences, and a catalytic (kinase) SH1 domain (khatri2018theroleof pages 16-21, mayro2022thecharacterizationofa pages 17-24). Uniquely, ABL2 possesses additional domains in its C-terminal region: an F-actin binding domain and a microtubule binding domain, which are absent in ABL1. These additional domains are believed to confer a predominant cytoplasmic localization and specialized functions in cytoskeletal remodeling (hoj2020thecharacterizationof pages 31-37, khatri2018theroleof pages 135-138). The regulatory mechanism involves an autoinhibited “clamp” wherein the SH3 domain interacts with a polyproline–rich linker connecting the SH2 and kinase domains; this intramolecular interaction maintains the kinase in an inactive conformation until relieved by activation signals (mayro2022thecharacterizationof pages 24-29, laszlo2019structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2). In addition, a myristoylated N-terminal glycine may participate in reinforcing the inactive state by binding a hydrophobic pocket in the kinase domain (hoj2020thecharacterizationofa pages 31-37, khatri2018theroleof pages 16-21). Structural studies using crystallography and small-angle X-ray scattering have provided insights into the conformation of the SH3 domain and how tyrosine phosphorylation can sterically block ligand interactions without causing large conformational shifts (laszlo2019structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2, vasUnknownyearbalázsmerő1lászló pages 1-2).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of ABL2 is multifaceted, involving both autophosphorylation and phosphorylation by other kinases. Autocatalytic activity enables ABL2 to phosphorylate itself on key tyrosine residues, which can either stimulate its activity or modulate its interactions with regulatory proteins (mayro2022thecharacterizationofa pages 136-140, khatri2018theroleof pages 27-32). For example, phosphorylation of ABL2 can regulate the function of its SH3 domain by sterically hindering the binding of proline-rich ligands, thereby affecting downstream signaling cascades (laszlo2019structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2, vasUnknownyearbalázsmerő1lászló pages 1-2). Additionally, ABL2 can phosphorylate its own inhibitor ABI1, functioning in a feedback loop to regulate its own activity, and forms part of signaling complexes with adaptor proteins such as CRK and CRKL (information section, mayro2022thecharacterizationof pages 12-17, khatri2018theroleof pages 27-32). External regulatory cues, including growth factor signals and oxidative stress, further modulate ABL2 activity. In some contexts, phosphorylated substrates (such as ARHGAP35) are recruited to the cell periphery where they interact with other regulatory proteins (e.g., RASA1) to inhibit the RHO signaling pathway (information section, khatri2018theroleof pages 131-135). These layers of regulation ensure that ABL2 activity is tightly controlled, balancing its roles in promoting cell motility, adhesion, and receptor endocytosis (hoj2020thecharacterizationofa pages 49-55).\n\n7. Function  \nABL2 is a multifunctional kinase that plays a critical role in regulating cell growth, cytoskeletal dynamics, adhesion, and receptor trafficking. One of its primary functions is to mediate cytoskeletal remodeling by phosphorylating proteins that control actin and microtubule dynamics. For instance, its phosphorylation of MYH10 alters cell movement, while phosphorylation of CTTN (cortactin) modulates signaling events linked to actin rearrangements (information section). In addition, its ability to bind directly to F-actin and bundle filaments underscores its importance in maintaining and reorganizing the actin cytoskeleton (hoj2020thecharacterizationof pages 31-37, khatri2018theroleof pages 135-138).  \nBeyond its role in actin dynamics, ABL2 regulates cell adhesion and motility. It phosphorylates key regulators such as CRK, CRKL, DOK1, and ARHGAP35; the adhesion-dependent phosphorylation of ARHGAP35 promotes its association with RASA1 and the recruitment of ARHGAP35 to the cell periphery, culminating in the local inhibition of RHO GTPase activity. This regulatory pathway is essential for controlled cell spreading and migration (information section, khatri2018theroleof pages 131-135).  \nIn receptor-mediated endocytosis, ABL2 phosphorylates receptor tyrosine kinases like PDGFRB and proteins involved in endocytic sorting such as RIN1, thereby influencing receptor internalization and signal attenuation (arrington2019identificationofthe pages 8-9, khatri2018theroleof pages 27-32).  \nIn neural tissue, ABL2 is implicated in the modulation of neurotransmission at the synapse by phosphorylating synaptic proteins, which may affect synaptic plasticity and signal transmission in the brain (information section). Additionally, ABL2 is co-opted by pathogens during infection; certain microorganisms hijack ABL2 kinase signaling to reorganize the host actin cytoskeleton, facilitating processes like intracellular movement and egress from host cells (information section, moharram2021roleofflt3 pages 48-54).  \nFurthermore, ABL2 positively regulates chemokine-mediated T-cell migration, polarization, and homing to lymph nodes and immune-challenged tissues; this function is believed to occur via the activation of proteins such as NEDD9/HEF1 and RAP1, thereby influencing immune cell trafficking during inflammatory responses (information section).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral kinase inhibitors developed to target the activity of ABL family kinases—originally in the context of leukemias driven by the BCR-ABL fusion protein—also have activity against ABL2. For example, ATP-competitive inhibitors such as imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, and especially ponatinib show high levels of inhibition against ABL2, which has broad implications for both hematologic and solid tumors in which ABL2 is activated (zeng2020ponatinibandother pages 3-4, moharram2021roleofflt3 pages 90-95).  \nIn disease contexts, aberrant activation of ABL2 has been linked to various cancers, including chronic myelogenous leukemia (albeit more famously through BCR-ABL1 fusions), and numerous solid tumors such as breast, lung, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers, where its effects on actin remodeling, adhesion, and receptor endocytosis contribute to invasion and metastasis (hoj2020thecharacterizationofa pages 49-55, khatri2018theroleof pages 126-131).  \nNotably, pathogens are known to exploit ABL2-mediated pathways to induce cytoskeletal changes that favor their replication or spread. This emerging area of research underscores the significance of ABL2 not only in cancer biology but also in infectious diseases (information section, moharram2021roleofflt3 pages 48-54).  \nCurrent research is actively investigating the detailed regulatory networks involving ABL2, including its self-regulation via autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of inhibitor proteins such as ABI1, as well as its crosstalk with other signaling molecules like NEDD9 and RAP1 which govern immune cell behavior (information section, mayro2022thecharacterizationof pages 12-17).  \nMoreover, structural studies focusing on the phosphorylation of the SH3 domain in ABL2 provide key insights into the allosteric regulation of its interactions, with potential implications for the design of more selective inhibitors that target these regulatory interfaces (laszlo2019structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2, vasUnknownyearbalázsmerő1lászló pages 1-2).  \n\n9.

    "answer": "1. Phylogeny  \nCyclin‐dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) is a member of the cyclin‐dependent kinase family, which falls into the CMGC group of serine/threonine kinases that coordinate critical cell cycle events. CDK4 is evolutionarily conserved across eukaryotes and is found in all mammalian species; its conservation underscores its importance in regulating the cell cycle and integrating mitogenic signals (wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2). In phylogenetic analyses, CDK4 clusters with other cell cycle kinases such as CDK6, although subtle structural and regulatory differences distinguish its function from those of other CDKs (gao2020cyclindcdk46functions pages 21-23). Orthologs of CDK4 have been identified from lower eukaryotes to humans, suggesting that a common ancestral CDK bearing these characteristics existed before the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor and that subsequent gene duplications and diversifications have provided mammals with a refined mechanism for G1 phase regulation (wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 2-3).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK4 catalyzes the transfer of a γ‐phosphate from ATP to specific L-serine or L-threonine residues on substrate proteins. The classical reaction can be summarized as: ATP + [protein]–(L‐serine/threonine) → ADP + [protein]–(L‐serine/threonine)‐phosphate + H⁺ (gao2020cyclindcdk46functions pages 1-4). This phosphorylation reaction is critical for altering the conformation and activity of substrates such as the retinoblastoma protein (RB1), thereby promoting the release of bound E2F transcription factors and driving the cell toward S phase.\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nFor full catalytic activity, CDK4 requires association with a regulatory partner, most commonly a D-type cyclin (cyclin D1, D2, or D3), which acts as an essential cofactor that stabilizes its active conformation (wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 7-8). Moreover, as with most ATP-dependent kinases, divalent metal ions such as Mg²⁺ are critical for coordinating ATP binding and facilitating the phosphoryl transfer reaction (gao2020cyclindcdk46functions pages 1-4).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCDK4 exhibits a defined substrate specificity that is conferred largely by its interaction with D-type cyclins. Its most well-established substrate is the retinoblastoma protein (RB1), whose phosphorylation by the cyclin D–CDK4 complex leads to dissociation of E2F transcription factors and subsequent transcription of genes required for S phase progression (OpenTargets Search: -CDK4, zhang2023cellcycleprogression pages 1-6). In addition to RB1, CDK4 has been shown to phosphorylate SMAD3, thereby repressing its transcriptional activity in a cell cycle‐dependent manner (OpenTargets Search: -CDK4). The substrate recognition mechanism is thought to involve specific docking interactions provided by conserved regions in both CDK4 and its cyclin partner; however, consensus motifs beyond the requirement for serine or threonine in a specific context have not been as explicitly defined as those seen in some other kinases (gao2020cyclindcdk46functions pages 4-7).\n\n5. Structure  \nThe 3D structure of CDK4 is characterized by a conserved bilobal kinase domain. The smaller N-terminal lobe contains the ATP-binding pocket, while the larger C-terminal lobe forms the substrate-binding region and houses the activation loop. High-resolution crystal structures have revealed that CDK4 adopts a typical kinase fold, although its active conformation is only achieved upon binding to a cyclin D partner, which induces the requisite conformational rearrangements (gharbi2022crystalstructureof pages 1-2). Critical to its function is the activation loop, which must be phosphorylated (notably at threonine 172) to promote a competent catalytic geometry (zhang2024cdk2andcdk4 pages 1-2). In addition, unique structural features, such as a flexible β3–αC loop and the proper orientation of the αC–helix, have been implicated in modulating substrate interactions and inhibitor sensitivity (wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 17-18, zhang2025distinctallostericnetworks pages 1-4).\n\n6. Regulation  \nCDK4 activity is subject to multiple layers of regulation that ensure strict control over cell cycle progression. The initial activation step requires binding to a D-type cyclin, which promotes conformational changes in CDK4 that are essential for ATP binding and catalysis (gao2020cyclindcdk46functions pages 1-4). Full activation further depends on the phosphorylation of a key threonine residue (T172) in the activation loop, a modification carried out by CDK-activating kinase (CAK) and aided by additional kinases in certain cellular contexts (colleoni2017jnksfunctionas pages 1-2). Inhibitory proteins, most notably p16^INK4a and p27^Kip1, bind to CDK4 and prevent its association with cyclin D or block substrate access, thereby serving as checkpoints to avoid aberrant cell proliferation (wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 19-20, fassl2022cdk4andcdk6 pages 1-3). Recent studies have highlighted that CDK4 is also regulated via allosteric mechanisms that affect its dynamics and inhibitor response, with specific loop regions (such as the β3–αC loop) playing a significant role in its catalytic efficiency (zhang2025distinctallostericnetworks pages 19-21). Moreover, phosphorylation of regulatory partners like p21 can modulate CDK4’s activity further, adding an extra dimension to its control within the cell (colleoni2017jnksfunctionas pages 10-11).\n\n7. Function  \nCDK4 functions primarily as a driver of cell cycle progression through the G1 phase. By phosphorylating the retinoblastoma protein (RB1), CDK4 disrupts the RB/E2F complex, thereby releasing E2F transcription factors that activate the expression of genes critical for the transition into S phase (OpenTargets Search: -CDK4, zhang2023cellcycleprogression pages 1-6). Beyond its canonical role in RB phosphorylation, CDK4 also phosphorylates SMAD3, providing an additional mechanism by which it can modulate transcriptional programs in a cell cycle-dependent manner (OpenTargets Search: -CDK4). CDK4 is an integral component of the ternary complex formed with cyclin D and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27^Kip1, which is necessary for its nuclear translocation and full enzymatic activity (ammazzalorso2021developmentofcdk46 pages 18-19). This kinase thereby integrates diverse mitogenic and antimitogenic signals, coordinating cell proliferation with extracellular cues. Dysregulation of CDK4—whether by overexpression, mutation, or impaired inhibition—is closely associated with oncogenic processes, and its aberrant activity has been documented in various malignancies such as breast cancer and melanoma (fassl2022cdk4andcdk6 pages 3-4, gao2020cyclindcdk46functions pages 13-16).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nGiven its central role in cell cycle regulation, CDK4 has emerged as a major target for anticancer therapies. Several inhibitors, including palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib, have been clinically approved for use in hormone receptor–positive breast cancers, reflecting the therapeutic benefit of targeting the cyclin D–CDK4/6 axis (fassl2022cdk4andcdk6 pages 16-18, gharbi2022crystalstructureof pages 1-2). In addition to direct kinase inhibition, recent research is exploring approaches that promote the degradation of CDK4 using technologies such as PROTACs, as a means to overcome resistance mechanisms associated with conventional inhibitors (gao2020cyclindcdk46functions pages 16-19, zhang2025distinctallostericnetworks pages 30-32). Furthermore, mutations that disrupt the interaction between CDK4 and its inhibitors (for example, within the p16^INK4a binding interface) have been linked to familial melanoma, underscoring the clinical significance of the regulatory interfaces of CDK4 (wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 18-19, n2015analysingtheeffect pages 19-20). Ongoing studies using molecular dynamics simulations and allosteric network analyses continue to refine our understanding of CDK4’s dynamic behavior and inform the development of more selective and potent inhibitors (zhang2025distinctallostericnetworks pages 24-27, zhang2024cdk2andcdk4 pages 13-14).\n\n9.

    "answer": "1. Phylogeny  \nAMPK catalytic subunit alpha‐1 (AMPKα1), encoded by PRKAA1, is an evolutionarily ancient serine/threonine protein kinase that belongs to the SNF1/AMPK family, a group of kinases that play a central role in cellular energy homeostasis across eukaryotes (herzig2018ampkguardianof pages 1-2). AMPKα1 is part of a heterotrimeric complex that emerged early during evolution, with orthologs found in fungi, protists, and mammals, indicating that the core energy‐sensing mechanism was already established in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (roustan2016anevolutionaryperspective pages 1-1). In vertebrates, gene duplication events have given rise to multiple isoforms of the catalytic α‐subunit (α1 and α2), with AMPKα1 being one of the dominant isoforms present in a wide variety of tissues (herzig2018ampkguardianof pages 3-4). Phylogenetic analyses place AMPKα1 within a conserved kinase lineage that shares structural and regulatory features with its evolutionary relatives, including yeast SNF1 and plant kinases controlling energy metabolism (kurumbail2016structureandregulation pages 4-6). The conservation of critical residues, such as the phosphorylation‐sensitive threonine in the activation loop (Thr172 in α1), underscores the functional importance of this kinase domain throughout evolution (herzig2018ampkguardianof pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nAMPKα1 catalyzes the phosphorylation reaction in which a phosphate group is transferred from ATP to specific serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins, thereby modulating their activity (herzig2018ampkguardianof pages 1-2). The catalytic process can be summarized by the chemical reaction: ATP + [protein]–(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]–(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (herzig2018ampkguardianof pages 3-4). This phosphorylation mechanism allows AMPKα1 to rapidly alter the function of key metabolic enzymes and regulatory proteins in response to fluctuations in cellular energy levels (langendorf2015choreographyofampk pages 1-2). The reaction is typical of serine/threonine kinases and is central to AMPK’s role as a metabolic master switch, enabling the inhibition of anabolic processes and the activation of catabolic pathways when energy is low (herzig2018ampkguardianof pages 12-13).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of AMPKα1 is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions, primarily magnesium (Mg²⁺), which serve as essential cofactors to facilitate the binding of ATP in the kinase active site (kurumbail2016structureandregulation pages 4-6). In addition to Mg²⁺, the enzyme’s regulation is closely linked to the binding of adenine nucleotides—AMP, ADP, and ATP—to the regulatory gamma subunit, which indirectly modulates the activity of the catalytic α‐subunit (li2019ampkandautophagy pages 97-100). The proper coordination of metal ions and the correct nucleotide occupancy orchestrate the conformational states necessary for AMPKα1 to either maintain a low basal activity in energy-replete conditions or to rapidly enhance its catalytic function during energy stress (langendorf2015choreographyofampk pages 2-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nAMPKα1 exhibits broad substrate specificity and preferentially phosphorylates serine/threonine residues on proteins involved in metabolic regulation, thereby coordinating cellular energy status with multiple physiological processes (herzig2018ampkguardianof pages 1-2). Among the well‐characterized substrates regulated by AMPKα1 are key metabolic enzymes, including acetyl‐CoA carboxylases (ACACA and ACACB), which are inactivated upon phosphorylation to inhibit fatty acid synthesis (herzig2018ampkguardianof pages 12-13). In addition, AMPKα1 phosphorylates regulatory proteins involved in glucose metabolism—such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and the Rab GTPase-activating protein TBC1D4 (AS160)—thereby enhancing glucose uptake in skeletal muscle (kjøbsted2018ampkinskeletal pages 27-28). Although the precise consensus recognition motif for AMPK substrates is not as sharply defined as in some other kinases, its substrate recognition involves a surrounding context enriched in basic and hydrophobic residues, a feature common to many serine/threonine kinases (herzig2018ampkguardianof pages 3-4). Together, these features enable AMPKα1 to target a wide array of proteins across metabolic, transcriptional, and signaling pathways, ensuring rapid adaptation to changes in cellular energy status (li2019ampkandautophagy pages 299-301).\n\n5. Structure  \nAMPKα1 is comprised of a well‐organized domain architecture that includes an N-terminal catalytic kinase domain responsible for phosphate transfer, a central autoinhibitory domain (AID), and regions involved in mediating interactions with the regulatory β and γ subunits (herzig2018ampkguardianof pages 3-4). The N-terminal kinase domain adopts the classical bilobal structure seen in many serine/threonine kinases with a smaller N-lobe that binds ATP and a larger C-lobe that interacts with substrates, with a highly conserved threonine (Thr172 in α1) in the activation loop whose phosphorylation is essential for full catalytic activation (kurumbail2016structureandregulation pages 4-6). Structural studies using X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy have revealed that in its active state, the kinase domain of AMPKα1 is stabilized through the association with its regulatory subunits, which in turn influence allosteric transitions via binding of adenine nucleotides to specific CBS domains on the γ‐subunit (yan2018structureandphysiological pages 4-7, steinberg2023newinsightsinto pages 9-13). The autoinhibitory domain, located adjacent to the kinase domain, serves as a modulator that can restrict catalytic activity under conditions where energy is plentiful, and its disengagement is often associated with conformational changes upon AMP binding (langendorf2015choreographyofampk pages 1-2, kurumbail2016structureandregulation pages 6-9). Unique to the heterotrimeric complex, the β subunit provides a carbohydrate‐binding module (CBM) that links AMPK activity to cellular glycogen levels, while the γ subunit contains four tandem cystathionine-β-synthase repeats that form nucleotide-binding sites; these sites are critical for relaying changes in the cellular energy state to the catalytic α‐subunit (herzig2018ampkguardianof pages 12-13, langendorf2015choreographyofampk pages 2-2). This integrative domain organization and the observed 3D architecture underscore how structural features are harnessed by AMPKα1 to respond to metabolic signals with high specificity and sensitivity (yan2021structureofan pages 1-3).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of AMPKα1 is multifaceted and achieved through a combination of post-translational modifications, allosteric effects, and protein-protein interactions that collectively fine-tune its kinase activity (herzig2018ampkguardianof pages 3-4). A critical regulatory event is the phosphorylation of Thr172 in the activation loop of the kinase domain, predominantly catalyzed by upstream kinases such as liver kinase B1 (LKB1) and CaMKKβ; this phosphorylation is essential for the full activation of AMPKα1 (herzig2018ampkguardianof pages 3-4, jeon2016regulationandfunction pages 1-3). Binding of AMP (and to a lesser extent ADP) to the regulatory γ subunit not only allosterically activates AMPKγ but also provides protection against dephosphorylation of Thr172 by protein phosphatases, thereby prolonging the active state of the kinase (langendorf2015choreographyofampk pages 1-2, li2019ampkandautophagy pages 97-100). In addition to these phosphorylation-based mechanisms, synthetic activators such as A769662 and salicylate engage specific allosteric drug and metabolite (ADaM) sites located at the interface between the kinase domain of AMPKα1 and the carbohydrate-binding module of the β subunit, thereby enhancing the enzyme’s activity independently of the AMP/ADP levels (kurumbail2016structureandregulation pages 12-15, langendorf2015choreographyofampk pages 1-2). Furthermore, additional regulatory layers are imposed by protein conformation changes mediated by the autoinhibitory domain, whose repositioning upon AMP binding contributes to the relief of inhibition and full catalytic activation (herzig2018ampkguardianof pages 3-4). The combined effects of these mechanisms allow AMPKα1 to function as a precise energy sensor that can integrate multiple environmental cues and rapidly adjust cellular metabolism to changing energy demands (steinberg2023newinsightsinto pages 1-4).\n\n7. Function  \nAMPKα1 serves as the central metabolic sensor responsible for maintaining cellular and whole-body energy homeostasis by orchestrating the balance between energy-consuming anabolic processes and energy-generating catabolic pathways (herzig2018ampkguardianof pages 1-2). When intracellular ATP levels drop and AMP/ADP levels rise, AMPKα1 becomes activated and phosphorylates a broad array of substrates, leading to the inhibition of anabolic processes such as protein synthesis, lipid biosynthesis, and glycogen synthesis, while simultaneously stimulating pathways that generate ATP such as glucose uptake, fatty acid oxidation, and autophagy (herzig2018ampkguardianof pages 12-13, li2019ampkandautophagy pages 100-103). In liver, for example, activated AMPKα1 phosphorylates transcription regulators such as CRTC2/TORC2 to suppress gluconeogenesis, and in skeletal muscle, it promotes glucose uptake by facilitating the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane (kjøbsted2018ampkinskeletal pages 27-28, langendorf2015choreographyofampk pages 2-2). AMPKα1 also exerts long-term effects on metabolism by phosphorylating transcriptional coactivators and histone proteins, thereby influencing gene expression patterns involved in lipid metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis, and cell growth (herzig2018ampkguardianof pages 3-4, li2019ampkandautophagy pages 299-301). In addition to its metabolic roles, AMPKα1 is involved in the regulation of autophagy by directly phosphorylating components of the autophagy machinery such as ULK1, thus promoting the clearance of damaged cellular components and supporting mitochondrial quality control (li2019ampkandautophagy pages 93-97, steinberg2023newinsightsinto pages 13-17). The phosphorylation of cell cycle regulators and modulators of mTORC1 activity further underscores its function as a key mediator of cell growth and proliferation in response to nutrient and energy availability (herzig2018ampkguardianof pages 12-13, jeon2016regulationandfunction pages 1-3). Consequently, AMPKα1 is of considerable interest not only as a regulator of energy metabolism but also as a potential therapeutic target in metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, and even in cancer, where its activity can dictate cell survival under stressful conditions (ross2016amp‐activatedproteinkinase pages 7-9).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nBeyond its well‐characterized roles in metabolic regulation, AMPKα1 has been implicated in several additional biological processes and disease contexts. It exhibits tau‐protein kinase activity in response to certain stressors such as amyloid beta, although the in vivo significance of this activity remains uncertain and is subject to ongoing debate (herzig2018ampkguardianof pages 3-4). AMPKα1 is also involved in the regulation of cellular polarity and cytoskeletal rearrangements, potentially influencing processes such as cell migration through indirect activation of myosin (herzig2018ampkguardianof pages 12-13). Its function extends into the arena of transcriptional control by modulating histone phosphorylation and chromatin remodeling, thereby linking energy status to gene expression (li2019ampkandautophagy pages 97-100). Pharmacologically, several compounds have been identified as activators of AMPK, including the nucleoside analog AICAR, the small molecule A769662, and clinically used agents like metformin, which are known to stimulate AMPK activity indirectly by inhibiting mitochondrial complex I (kurumbail2016structureandregulation pages 12-15, langendorf2015choreographyofampk pages 1-2). Conversely, inhibitors such as Compound C (dorsomorphin) have been used in research settings to dissect the contributions of AMPK activity; however, issues with specificity limit their clinical utility (smiles2025ampkphosphositeprofiling pages 1-2). In cancer biology, AMPKα1 plays a dual or “Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde” role, acting as a tumor suppressor early on by restricting anabolic growth, while in established tumors it may support cell survival under metabolic stress (varaciruelos2019thestrangecase pages 1-2, varaciruelos2019thestrangecase pages 18-19). Ongoing research is also focused on understanding how mutations in AMPK subunits—including those affecting nucleotide binding or phosphorylation sites—might contribute to metabolic diseases and other pathologies (ross2016amp‐activatedproteinkinase pages 4-6, varaciruelos2019thestrangecase pages 19-20). These additional facets highlight the versatility of AMPKα1 as both a sensor and effector in cellular metabolism and stress response, and they continue to make it a focal point of biomedical research (steinberg2023newinsightsinto pages 17-18).\n\n9.

    "answer": "1. Phylogeny  \nMAPK13, also known as p38 delta, PRKM13 or SAPK4, is one of the four p38 isoforms within the stress‐activated MAP kinase (MAPK) family, which belongs to the larger CMGC kinase group. Its phylogenetic placement traces back to early eukaryotic evolution, and it shares a common ancestry with other p38 MAPKs such as p38α (MAPK14), p38β (MAPK11) and p38γ (MAPK12) (brennan2021p38mapks— pages 1-2, orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 296-298). Within the kinome, the p38 MAPK subfamily is characterized by their activation in response to stress and inflammatory stimuli; MAPK13 retains approximately 60% sequence identity with its isoforms but has evolved distinct substrate‐recognition and regulatory features (brennan2021p38mapks— pages 1-2, shabardina2023evolutionaryanalysisof pages 13-14). Orthologs of MAPK13 have been identified in a wide range of vertebrate species, and evolutionary analyses indicate that while p38α is broadly expressed and highly conserved, p38δ appears with a more tissue‐restricted pattern outside the brain and muscle (shabardina2023evolutionaryanalysisof pages 5-6, shabardina2023evolutionaryanalysisof pages 6-7). This divergence is further emphasized by specific amino acid substitutions in regions critical for substrate docking and activation, suggesting that MAPK13 has acquired unique functions compared to its family members (orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 296-298, yende2021p38isoformsignaling pages 1-1).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nMAPK13 catalyzes the transfer of the terminal phosphate from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues on its substrate proteins. The general reaction can be summarized as follows: ATP + [protein]–OH → ADP + [protein]–O–P + H⁺. In this context the kinase specifically phosphorylates serine/threonine residues typically present in a proline-directed motif, thereby altering the activity, stability, or subcellular localization of target proteins (iqbal2022designcrystalstructure pages 3-4, orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 33-38). Among its reported substrates are downstream protein kinases such as MAPKAPK2, which itself undergoes phosphorylation leading to further amplification of the stress response, and regulators of protein translation such as EEF2K, with MAPK13 phosphorylating and inactivating this elongation factor kinase (brennan2021p38mapks— pages 1-2). Additional physiological substrates include cytoskeletal proteins like MAPT (tau) and STMN1, transcription factors such as MYB – whose phosphorylation by MAPK13 flags it for proteasome-mediated degradation – and regulators of insulin secretion like PRKD1 (zhang2024afirstinkindmapk13 pages 1-4, subbannayya2019dynamicsofdual pages 9-12).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nAs with other MAP kinases, the catalytic activity of MAPK13 is dependent on divalent metal ions. The binding of Mg²⁺ is critical for proper ATP coordination and the stabilization of the transition state during phosphotransfer (iqbal2022designcrystalstructure pages 3-4). Although Mn²⁺ can sometimes substitute for Mg²⁺ in kinase assays, Mg²⁺ is considered the primary cofactor for the activity of p38 MAPKs including MAPK13. Beyond metal ions, proper activation of MAPK13 is achieved by phosphorylation at specific residues in the activation loop, a process that is itself regulated by upstream kinases (brennan2021p38mapks— pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nMAPK13 exhibits substrate specificity that is largely defined by its capacity for proline-directed phosphorylation. The kinase generally recognizes a consensus substrate motif with a phosphorylatable serine or threonine residue immediately followed by proline (S/T-P), a feature common to other MAPK family members (orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 49-52). However, studies have indicated that MAPK13 may also demonstrate unique preferences that distinguish it from p38α and other family isoforms. For instance, MAPK13’s substrate specificity allows it to efficiently phosphorylate downstream kinases such as MAPKAPK2 and regulatory factors involved in cytoskeletal dynamics like STMN1, as well as translation regulators such as EEF2K (brennan2021p38mapks— pages 1-2, escos2023p38γandp38δ pages 14-15). Moreover, phosphorylation of transcription factors—including the rapid targeting of MYB for degradation in response to stress—and the regulation of chemokine gene expression (e.g., CXCL14 in response to UV irradiation) have been attributed to MAPK13 (brennan2021p38mapks— pages 1-2, escos2023p38γandp38δ pages 21-22). The distinct amino acid changes in regions that form the substrate docking groove, as well as allosteric sites around the ATP-binding pocket, further contribute to this isoform-specific substrate selection (orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 33-38, iqbal2022designcrystalstructure pages 3-4).\n\n5. Structure  \nThe structure of MAPK13, like other members of the p38 MAPK family, is composed of a bilobal kinase domain with an N-terminal lobe predominantly consisting of β-sheets and a C-terminal lobe rich in α-helices, with the catalytic cleft formed at their interface (iqbal2022designcrystalstructure pages 3-4, wu2024mapk13controlsstructural pages 1-4). Central to its function is the activation loop containing the conserved T-G-Y (threonine–glycine–tyrosine) motif; dual phosphorylation of the threonine and tyrosine residues within this motif is required for transitioning MAPK13 from an inactive to an active conformation (brennan2021p38mapks— pages 1-2). Unique structural features of MAPK13 include non-conservative amino acid substitutions at key positions within the docking groove and substrate binding regions (shabardina2023evolutionaryanalysisof pages 7-8), which modulate its interaction with specific substrates compared to other p38 isoforms. Advanced structural studies, such as X-ray crystallography and molecular dynamics simulations, have provided insights into how these substitutions subtly alter the catalytic efficiency and inhibitor binding profiles of MAPK13 (wu2024mapk13controlsstructural pages 10-12, kim2022mapk13stabilizationvia pages 1-4). Recent data also reveal that MAPK13 contains potential sites for post-transcriptional regulation mediated by m⁶A RNA modifications, indirectly influencing protein structural stability and abundance (kim2023mapk13stabilizationvia pages 1-2). Overall, MAPK13 possesses the canonical MAPK fold, yet small yet critical variations in its amino acid composition provide the structural basis for its distinct regulatory and substrate-specific properties (orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 38-41).\n\n6. Regulation  \nMAPK13 is subject to multilayered regulation at both the transcriptional and post-translational levels. At the post-translational level, activation occurs via phosphorylation of dual residues in its activation loop by upstream MAPK kinases (MAP2Ks), primarily MKK3 and, in certain contexts, MKK6 (brennan2021p38mapks— pages 1-2, shrestha2022theregulationof pages 31-34). Once phosphorylated, MAPK13 adopts an active conformation that enables substrate docking and phosphorylation. In addition to the classic kinase cascade, recent studies have revealed that mRNA for MAPK13 is regulated by N⁶-methyladenosine (m⁶A) modifications. The METTL3-METTL14-WTAP complex deposits these modifications near the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of MAPK13 mRNA, facilitating its degradation through recruitment of YTHDF2. Inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin disrupts this m⁶A-mediated degradation pathway, leading to increased MAPK13 mRNA stability and consequently higher protein levels (kim2022mapk13stabilizationvia pages 1-4, kim2023mapk13stabilizationvia pages 1-2). This feedback mechanism suggests that under conditions of mTORC1 inhibition, MAPK13 may provide oncogenic signals by promoting cell growth. Additionally, other proteins such as PPFIA1 have been implicated in the differential regulation of MAPK13 expression, where knockdown of PPFIA1 results in altered MAPK13 protein abundance, further impacting downstream processes like PKD activation and vesicular trafficking (tortarolo2022decipheringanovel pages 61-63, tortarolo2022decipheringanovel pages 65-68). Thus, by integrating signals from stress-induced phosphorylation cascades and epitranscriptomic modifications, the regulation of MAPK13 is both complex and context-dependent (holtzman2024mitogenactivatedproteinkinaseguided pages 2-3, shrestha2022theregulationof pages 34-38).\n\n7. Function  \nMAPK13 functions as a serine/threonine kinase that plays a central role in cellular responses to environmental stress and inflammatory signals. It is activated in response to extracellular cues such as pro-inflammatory cytokines and physical stress, which in turn leads to modulation of diverse signaling networks. Among its critical biological roles is the direct phosphorylation of transactivation factors such as ELK1 and ATF2, thereby modulating stress-induced gene expression (brennan2021p38mapks— pages 1-2, escos2023p38γandp38δ pages 1-2). MAPK13 phosphorylates and activates downstream kinases such as MAPKAPK2, which further propagates the signal transduction cascade to modulate cellular responses ranging from cytokine production to cytoskeletal rearrangements (escos2023p38γandp38δ pages 14-15, subbannayya2019dynamicsofdual pages 9-12).  \nFurthermore, MAPK13 regulates protein translation through the phosphorylation-induced inactivation of EEF2K, thereby influencing mRNA translation efficiency and cellular protein synthesis (brennan2021p38mapks— pages 1-2). In the realm of cytoskeletal remodeling, MAPK13 phosphorylates proteins including MAPT (tau) and STMN1, impacting microtubule dynamics and thus affecting cellular morphology and motility (brennan2021p38mapks— pages 1-2, orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 29-33). Its role in the epidermis is notable; MAPK13 contributes to keratinocyte differentiation and apoptosis, and has been implicated in skin tumor development, highlighting its significance in maintaining epidermal homeostasis under stress (brennan2021p38mapks— pages 1-2). Additionally, MAPK13 mediates the up-regulation of chemokine gene expression, such as that of CXCL14, in response to UV irradiation, thereby modulating inflammatory responses in the skin (brennan2021p38mapks— pages 1-2, escos2023p38γandp38δ pages 21-22). In pancreatic beta cells, MAPK13 phosphorylates PRKD1, resulting in its down-regulation and affecting insulin secretion (zhang2024afirstinkindmapk13 pages 1-4). Taken together, these functions place MAPK13 as a multipotent regulator of cellular stress responses, inflammation, differentiation and metabolic control, with its diverse substrate portfolio underscoring its importance in a variety of physiological and pathological contexts (wu2024mapk13controlsstructural pages 12-14, yende2021p38isoformsignaling pages 1-1).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nDespite its crucial role in cellular stress responses, MAPK13 is among the less well-studied members of the p38 MAPK family, and research is ongoing to further clarify its isoform-specific functions and regulation. Recent advances have led to the development of the first-in-kind selective inhibitors of MAPK13, such as NuP-4, which have demonstrated efficacy in correcting aberrant basal-epithelial stem cell reprogramming and ameliorating post-injury structural remodeling in lung tissue models (zhang2024afirstinkindmapk13 pages 1-4, wu2024mapk13controlsstructural pages 12-14). Ongoing investigations are also exploring the role of MAPK13 in drug resistance mechanisms, particularly in the context of mTORC1 inhibition by rapamycin, where stabilization of MAPK13 mRNA has been shown to limit the anticancer efficacy of rapamycin (kim2022mapk13stabilizationvia pages 1-4, kim2023mapk13stabilizationvia pages 1-2). Disease associations for MAPK13 include its involvement in inflammatory skin diseases, modulation of chemokine expression in response to UV light, contributions to skin tumor development, and potential roles in metabolic dysregulation as observed in impaired insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells (brennan2021p38mapks— pages 1-2). Although detailed mutation data for MAPK13 are currently scarce, genetic studies and kinome-wide analyses continue to investigate polymorphisms and rare variants that may impact its function and be implicated in human pathology (OpenTargets Search: -MAPK13, liu2021leveragingdiversedata pages 69-74). Given its multifaceted regulatory roles and emerging therapeutic potential, MAPK13 remains a promising target for drug discovery in diverse conditions ranging from chronic inflammatory disorders to metabolic diseases and cancers (escos2023p38γandp38δ pages 6-7, shrestha2022theregulationof pages 87-89).\n\n9.
