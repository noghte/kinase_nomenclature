Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny:  \nPSKH1 (Protein serine kinase H1; Uniprot: P11801) is a member of the serine/threonine kinase superfamily that displays significant evolutionary conservation among metazoans. Early sequence analyses of the human PSKH1 gene revealed an overall conservation of the catalytic core with ~50% sequence identity to rat CaMKI, which is a member of the Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent kinase (CAMK) group (brede2000characterizationofpskh1 pages 3-6). Comparative studies indicate that PSKH1 is found ubiquitously in various species, with orthologs documented in mammals and in distantly related organisms such as the pearl oyster Pinctada fucata, whose homolog shares conserved kinase subdomains with the human protein (dai2005cloningandcharacterization pages 2-5). Phylogenetic analysis based on conserved catalytic sequences locates PSKH1 within an evolutionary branch that is common to CAMK kinases. In addition, detailed studies have established that, in vertebrates, the PSKH family comprises both PSKH1 and its paralog PSKH2, with PSKH1 retaining catalytic activity and PSKH2 functioning as a pseudokinase in certain species due to key amino acid substitutions (reiterer2014dayofthe pages 6-7). According to the classification framework established by Manning et al. (2002) – “The protein kinase complement of the human genome” and “Evolution of protein kinase signaling from yeast to man” – PSKH1 is assigned to the serine/threonine kinases within the CAMK group. This group represents one of the evolutionarily conserved kinase families, whose origins can be traced back to an ancestral eukaryotic kinase complement. The protein’s evolutionary lineage underscores its inclusion in a core set of kinases that are present in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA), maintained through extensive speciation events (Manning2002, Manning2002).  \n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed:  \nPSKH1 catalyzes the transfer of the γ-phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins. The generalized reaction is: ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (brede2000characterizationofpskh1 pages 10-11). This phosphorylation reaction is fundamental for modulating the function, localization, or stability of proteins involved in the regulation of pre-mRNA processing and splice factor compartment dynamics (brede2000characterizationofpskh1 pages 10-11).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements:  \nThe catalytic activity of PSKH1 depends on divalent cations, with Mg²⁺ required as a cofactor to facilitate ATP binding and phosphate transfer (brede2000characterizationofpskh1 pages 10-11). In several biochemical assays, the kinase activity of PSKH1 is measured under conditions that include Mg²⁺ to support efficient catalysis (brede2000characterizationofpskh1 pages 8-10).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity:  \nStudies investigating the substrate specificity of serine/threonine kinases indicate that PSKH1 displays a preference for phosphorylating serine residues, with its substrate recognition motif characterized by the presence of a basic residue – typically arginine – at the –3 position relative to the phosphoacceptor site (horne2025pskh1kinaseactivity pages 2-3). Comprehensive mapping using approaches as outlined in Johnson et al. (2023) has established consensus substrate motifs for the human serine/threonine kinome. Within this atlas, kinases in the CAMK group—including PSKH1—tend to select substrates that conform to a motif that includes a basic residue positioned three residues upstream from the phosphorylatable serine (johnson2023anatlasof pages 4-5). In vitro kinase assays have revealed that PSKH1 does not phosphorylate broad-spectrum substrates such as histone H1 or myelin basic protein, indicating its substrate specificity is relatively narrow and most consistent with proteins involved in nuclear splice factor compartment regulation (brede2000characterizationofpskh1 pages 10-11, brede2002pskh1anovel pages 8-9).\n\n5. Structure:  \nPSKH1 is organized around a conserved kinase catalytic domain that comprises 11 subdomains typical for serine/threonine kinases (brede2000characterizationofpskh1 pages 3-6). The catalytic domain contains the conserved motifs required for ATP binding and phosphotransfer, including the VAIK motif with a critical lysine residue (located at approximately position 220), the HRD catalytic loop, and the DFG motif that coordinates magnesium ions (brede2000characterizationofpskh1 pages 3-6, reiterer2014dayofthe pages 6-7). In addition to the catalytic core, PSKH1 contains a proline-rich N-terminal region and an SR-rich C-terminal region; the latter is characteristic of proteins that interact with splice factor compartments (brede2002pskh1anovel pages 7-8). Structural studies have demonstrated that the kinase domain of PSKH1 is sufficient for homodimerization, with dimer formation being mediated primarily by interaction regions within the catalytic core (brede2000characterizationofpskh1 pages 8-10). While a high-resolution crystal structure of human PSKH1 may not be available, predicted models such as those generated by AlphaFold provide insight into the overall bilobal kinase architecture with an N-terminal lobe predominantly responsible for ATP binding (containing the glycine-rich loop) and a larger C-terminal lobe that contributes to substrate binding and regulatory interactions (horne2025pskh1kinaseactivity pages 7-8). In addition, localization determinants, such as a nuclear localization signal embedded within a basic region in the C-terminus, and motifs likely involved in interactions with other proteins (e.g., splice factors), further contribute to the structural and functional organization of PSKH1 (brede2002pskh1anovel pages 1-2).\n\n6. Regulation:  \nPSKH1 is subject to multiple regulatory mechanisms that include autophosphorylation and protein–protein interactions. Autophosphorylation occurs predominantly on serine residues within a region spanning amino acids approximately 372 to 381, and this modification appears to be an intermolecular event (brede2000characterizationofpskh1 pages 10-11, brede2002pskh1anovel pages 8-9). The kinase’s activity can be modulated by calcium sensor proteins: for example, binding of the Ca²⁺/calmodulin complex to the kinase domain leads to inhibition of its autophosphorylation and catalytic activity (horne2025pskh1kinaseactivity pages 1-2, horne2025pskh1kinaseactivity pages 7-8). In contrast, other regulatory interactors such as UNC119B are capable of activating PSKH1 via direct engagement with the kinase domain, and mutations in the lipidation sites (myristoylation at Gly2 and palmitoylation at Cys3) have been shown to alter its basal activity and responsiveness to such regulatory proteins (horne2025pskh1kinaseactivity pages 7-8, dai2005cloningandcharacterization pages 5-7). Additional post-translational modifications, including potential phosphorylation events by other kinases, may further influence the subcellular localization and function of PSKH1; immunofluorescence studies have documented its presence in nuclear splice factor compartments, centrosomes, and the Golgi apparatus – localizations that are also sensitive to treatments such as Brefeldin A (brede2000characterizationofpskh1 pages 1-2, brede2002pskh1anovel pages 5-6).\n\n7. Function:  \nThe primary biological role attributed to PSKH1 is its involvement in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing. PSKH1 has been shown to phosphorylate components related to the splice factor compartments (SFCs) within the nucleus, which contain non-snRNP splicing factors enriched in serine/arginine (SR) domains (brede2002pskh1anovel pages 1-2, brede2002pskh1anovel pages 6-7). In expression studies using cultured mammalian cells, PSKH1 has been detected in multiple intracellular locations, including the nuclear speckles, which are enriched in splicing regulators such as SC35 and ASF/SF2 (brede2000characterizationofpskh1 pages 1-2, brede2002pskh1anovel pages 7-8). Overexpression of PSKH1 in cell models results in altered nuclear organization of the SR proteins and shifts in the alternative splicing patterns, as evidenced by changes in adenovirus E1A minigene splice site usage (brede2002pskh1anovel pages 5-6, brede2002pskh1anovel pages 8-9). Beyond its nuclear functions, PSKH1 localization at the centrosomes and the Golgi apparatus suggests that it may also participate in the regulation of organelle dynamics, particularly in processes such as membrane trafficking and cell cycle control (brede2000characterizationofpskh1 pages 1-2, horne2025pskh1kinaseactivity pages 9-9). Tissue expression analyses have demonstrated ubiquitous expression with notable enrichment in the testis, specifically in pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids, pointing to additional roles in germ cell development (brede2000characterizationofpskh1 pages 3-6).\n\n8. Other Comments:  \nAt present, specific inhibitors for PSKH1 have not been well established, and the protein remains one of the less intensively studied kinases within the human kinome. Some investigations have linked aberrant expression or mutation of PSKH1 with developmental contexts such as kidney ciliopathies and certain cancers, although detailed clinical correlations and inhibitor profiles require further research (horne2025pskh1kinaseactivity pages 9-9, reiterer2014dayofthe pages 6-7). The role of PSKH1 in regulating splice factor dynamics and alternative splicing presents a potential avenue for therapeutic intervention in diseases where splicing is misregulated. Ongoing studies employing proximity proteomics and site‐directed mutagenesis continue to refine the functional and regulatory map of PSKH1, but no selective small molecule inhibitors have yet been advanced to clinical use. Resources such as kinase inhibitor databases may eventually provide more targeted chemical probes to dissect PSKH1 function in cellular models (buchser2010kinasephosphataseoverexpressionreveals pages 8-10).\n\n9.

Involved in Toll-like receptor (TLR) and IL-1R signaling pathways. Is rapidly recruited by MYD88 to the receptor-signaling complex upon TLR activation. Association with MYD88 leads to IRAK1 phosphorylation by IRAK4 and subsequent autophosphorylation and kinase activation. Phosphorylates E3 ubiquitin ligases Pellino proteins (PELI1, PELI2 and PELI3) to promote pellino-mediated polyubiquitination of IRAK1. Then, the ubiquitin-binding domain of IKBKG/NEMO binds to polyubiquitinated IRAK1 bringing together the IRAK1-MAP3K7/TAK1-TRAF6 complex and the NEMO-IKKA-IKKB complex. In turn, MAP3K7/TAK1 activates IKKs (CHUK/IKKA and IKBKB/IKKB) leading to NF-kappa-B nuclear translocation and activation. Alternatively, phosphorylates TIRAP to promote its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Phosphorylates the interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) to induce its activation and translocation to the nucleus, resulting in transcriptional activation of type I IFN genes, which drive the cell in an antiviral state.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny:  \nIRAK1 is a highly conserved member of the interleukin‐1 receptor‐associated kinase family that can be traced across all vertebrate species. Within the kinome, IRAK1 groups with other Toll/IL‐1 receptor signal transducers and is evolutionarily related to IRAK4, IRAK2, and the catalytically inactive IRAK-M. Sequence and domain organization analyses have shown that IRAK1 shares the characteristic N-terminal death domain and central kinase domain with its family members, and its conservation from early vertebrates onward indicates its fundamental role in innate immune signaling (janssens2003functionaldiversityand pages 1-2, barbera2012activationmechanismsof pages 33-36). Its phylogenetic relationships, as outlined in large-scale studies of the human kinase complement, place IRAK1 in a kinase subfamily integral to inflammatory response pathways, with evolutionary roots extending to the common ancestor of metazoans (janssens2003functionaldiversityand pages 9-10, barbera2012activationmechanismsof pages 39-41).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed:  \nIRAK1 is a serine/threonine-protein kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation reaction on specific substrate proteins. The reaction can be summarized as follows: ATP + [protein]–(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]–(L-serine/threonine phosphate) + H⁺ (woo…2001…analysisof pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements:  \nThe catalytic activity of IRAK1 is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions, typically Mg²⁺, which facilitates the binding of ATP and the subsequent transfer of the phosphate group to its substrate proteins (woo…2001…analysisof pages 1-2, wang2017crystalstructureof pages 4-5).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity:  \nAs a serine/threonine kinase, IRAK1 phosphorylates specific substrates involved in innate immune signaling. In its role in the Toll-like receptor (TLR) and IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) pathways, IRAK1 phosphorylates the E3 ubiquitin ligases known as Pellino proteins (PELI1, PELI2, and PELI3), which then promote subsequent polyubiquitination events required for downstream signaling complex assembly (abudayyeh2008leishmaniainducedirak1inactivation pages 3-4). Furthermore, IRAK1 phosphorylates other substrates such as the adaptor protein TIRAP and the transcription factor IRF7, thereby leading to the activation of NF-κB as well as type I interferon production. Recent high-throughput substrate specificity profiling for human serine/threonine kinases has defined consensus motifs for many kinases; although IRAK1’s precise consensus motif has not been unequivocally established within the context provided, relevant work on serine/threonine kinases suggests a preference for motifs containing basic residues preceding the phosphorylatable serine or threonine (Johnson2023Nature, YaronBarir2024Nature).\n\n5. Structure:  \nThe domain organization of IRAK1 consists of an N-terminal death domain, a central kinase domain, and a C-terminal regulatory region. The N-terminal death domain mediates critical interactions with the adaptor protein MyD88, enabling IRAK1 recruitment into the receptor-signaling complex (janssens2003functionaldiversityand pages 2-3). The central kinase domain exhibits the typical bilobal fold observed in serine/threonine kinases, containing an N-terminal lobe that coordinates ATP binding and a C-terminal lobe that houses key catalytic residues. The activation loop within the kinase domain, along with the conserved catalytic residues such as the invariant lysine (K239) and the critical aspartate (e.g., D340), are fundamental for enzymatic activity (woo…2001…analysisof pages 2-3, wang2017crystalstructureof pages 3-4). Crystal structure data, although challenged by limited proteolysis and protein degradation issues as noted in structural studies, indicate that IRAK1 has a more solvent-accessible ATP binding pocket compared to its paralog IRAK4 and contains unique cysteine residues (C302 and C307) in the αD-αE loop. These cysteine residues constitute potential covalent inhibitor targets and contribute to differences in inhibitor specificity, as evidenced by species-specific sensitivity to compounds such as JNK-IN-7 (wang2017crystalstructureof pages 3-4, 4-5). In addition, an insertion in the activation loop forms a partially resolved helix (designated αGH), and the presence of a bulky gatekeeper residue further contributes to its unique inhibitor binding characteristics (wang2017crystalstructureof pages 3-4).\n\n6. Regulation:  \nIRAK1 activity is tightly regulated through multiple post-translational modifications and protein–protein interactions. Its activation is initiated by recruitment to the activated IL-1 or Toll-like receptor complex by MyD88, where it is phosphorylated by IRAK4 on specific residues and subsequently undergoes autophosphorylation. This phosphorylation cascade results in conformational changes that are essential for the full activation of IRAK1 (woo…2001…analysisof pages 1-2, vollmer2017themechanismof pages 3-5). Furthermore, IRAK1 is subject to ubiquitination by E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as Pellino proteins, which are activated by IRAK1-mediated phosphorylation; polyubiquitination events are necessary for recruiting downstream signaling complexes including the TAK1–TRAF6 and the IKK complexes (abudayyeh2008leishmaniainducedirak1inactivation pages 8-9). Negative regulation of IRAK1 is mediated by dephosphorylation reactions through protein tyrosine phosphatases like SHP-1. SHP-1 binds directly to IRAK1 via a highly conserved kinase tyrosyl-based inhibitory motif (KTIM) present exclusively in IRAK1 among the IRAK family members, leading to rapid and sustained inhibition of its kinase activity. This mechanism is exploited by pathogens such as Leishmania to suppress macrophage activation during infection (abudayyeh2008leishmaniainducedirak1inactivation pages 3-4, abudayyeh2008leishmaniainducedirak1inactivation pages 4-5, dayyeh2009alterationofmacrophage pages 137-143). Additionally, sumoylation of IRAK1 can induce its nuclear translocation where it phosphorylates transcription factors like STAT3, thereby adding an extra layer of regulation and functional diversification (information section).\n\n7. Function:  \nIRAK1 plays a central role in initiating innate immune responses against pathogens. Upon Toll-like receptor (TLR) or interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) activation, IRAK1 is recruited by the adaptor MyD88 to the receptor-signaling complex, where it is phosphorylated by IRAK4 and self-activates through autophosphorylation. Fully active IRAK1 then phosphorylates downstream targets, notably the Pellino family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. The polyubiquitination of IRAK1 facilitates the assembly of large signaling complexes that include MAP3K7/TAK1, TRAF6, and the IKK complex, ultimately leading to the activation of the NF-κB and MAP kinase pathways. This cascade results in transcriptional induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as TNF-α, IL-12, and IL-1β), as well as the induction of type I interferon genes via IRF7 phosphorylation. In addition, IRAK1 phosphorylates TIRAP, promoting its ubiquitination and degradation, which modulates the duration and magnitude of TLR signaling (abudayyeh2008leishmaniainducedirak1inactivation pages 8-9, dayyeh2009alterationofmacrophage pages 137-143). In some contexts, when sumoylated, IRAK1 translocates to the nucleus to phosphorylate STAT3, thereby linking innate immune stimulation to transcriptional programs involved in antiviral defense and other cellular processes. IRAK1 is prominently expressed in immune cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, where its activity is essential for effective host defense against pathogens. Furthermore, the dysregulation of IRAK1 activity is associated with altered inflammatory responses and is implicated in pathology related to immunodeficiency, autoimmunity, and even certain cancers (dayyeh2009alterationofmacrophage pages 121-127, janssens2003functionaldiversityand pages 9-10).\n\n8. Other Comments:  \nSeveral small-molecule inhibitors targeting IRAK1 have been identified, with compounds such as JNK-IN-7 demonstrating inhibitory activity by covalently modifying a key cysteine (C302) in the kinase domain. This inhibition exhibits species-specific differences due to variations in residue composition at the inhibitor binding site (wang2017crystalstructureof pages 4-5, vollmer2017themechanismof pages 8-10). IRAK1 is exploited by pathogens such as Leishmania, which activate SHP-1 phosphatase to bind IRAK1 via its KTIM motif and thereby suppress macrophage inflammatory responses. Additionally, altered IRAK1 signaling has been linked to various inflammatory disorders and may contribute to oncogenic processes when aberrantly activated. Comprehensive analyses of IRAK1’s role in immune responses continue to underline its importance as a potential therapeutic target. Notable contributions in the substrate specificity of serine/threonine kinases, as well as evolutionary analyses of the kinome, have provided further context for understanding IRAK1’s place within the human kinase complement (Johnson2023Nature, Manning2002Science).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nIRAK2 (Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-like 2) belongs to the IRAK family of kinases, a group that is conserved throughout metazoans and can be traced back to the common ancestor of animals. Within the human kinome, IRAK2 is grouped alongside IRAK1, IRAK4, and IRAK-M, and its presence in mammals is supported by its identification in multiple species. Comparative sequence analyses reveal that IRAK2, like other family members, possesses a conserved N-terminal death domain as well as a central kinase domain, although its catalytic capacity has been a matter of debate in the literature. Phylogenetic studies have placed IRAK2 in close evolutionary proximity to IRAK1, with divergence likely occurring during early vertebrate evolution, as illustrated by molecular evolutionary analyses that compare vertebrate IRAKs with insect homologs such as Pelle and Tube (flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 35-39, gosu2012molecularevolutionand pages 1-2, janssens2003functionaldiversityand pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nIRAK2 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to specific serine/threonine residues on substrate proteins. In its kinase reaction, ATP reacts with a protein substrate containing serine/threonine residues to yield ADP and a phosphorylated protein, along with the release of a proton. This reaction typifies the canonical mechanism of protein kinases such as those in the IRAK family (hu2002regulationofil1 pages 5-6).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of IRAK2, as with most serine/threonine kinases, requires divalent metal ion cofactors. In particular, Mg²⁺ is essential to coordinate the ATP molecule in the active site, thereby facilitating the transfer of the γ-phosphate group to target substrates (flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 5-9, li2002irak4anovel pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nIRAK2 phosphorylates substrate proteins that are components of intracellular signaling cascades, particularly those involved in Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor pathways. Although comprehensive studies of IRAK2’s substrate consensus sequences are limited relative to more extensively characterized kinases, the general serine/threonine kinase mechanism implies that IRAK2 recognizes substrates with specific local motifs. Recent advances in the field of kinase substrate specificity—including the atlas of substrate specificities for the human serine/threonine kinome (Johnson2023Atlas) and intrinsic substrate specificity analyses for human tyrosine kinases (YaronBarir2024) – provide frameworks that could be applied to further elucidate IRAK2’s substrate selectivity. In the context of IRAK2 signaling, substrates include key adaptor and regulatory molecules such as TRAF6, components of the Myddosome complex, and downstream kinases in the MAPK cascade. However, the precise consensus motif for IRAK2 has not been fully established, and further studies are warranted to characterize its amino acid preferences (yeilding support from the priority publications in kinase specificity).\n\n5. Structure  \nIRAK2 is organized into several distinct domains that contribute to both its catalytic and regulatory functions. At the N-terminus, IRAK2 contains a death domain that mediates interactions with adaptor proteins such as MyD88 and Mal/TIRAP. This death domain is critical for the assembly of the Myddosome complex upon receptor engagement (flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 43-47, janssens2003functionaldiversityand pages 6-7). Following the death domain, a proline/serine/threonine-rich (ProST) region is present; this region often contributes to protein–protein interactions and may also influence the stability of the protein. The central portion of IRAK2 harbors a kinase domain, which is structurally similar to other serine/threonine kinases and contains conserved motifs typical of enzymatic activity, such as an invariant ATP-binding lysine residue. This kinase domain is responsible for its catalytic function, even though certain studies have described IRAK2 as having atypical or regulatory catalytic activity rather than robust enzymatic phosphorylation measured in vitro (benosman2013interleukin1receptorassociatedkinase2 pages 1-3, meylan2008irak2takesits pages 1-2). At the C-terminus, IRAK2 contains one or more TRAF6-binding motifs that facilitate the assembly of signaling complexes and subsequent ubiquitination events necessary for downstream NF-κB activation (flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 43-47, keating2007irak2participatesin pages 5-6). Recent structural insights, including those derived from crystallographic studies of related IRAK kinases and predictive models provided by AlphaFold, support this overall domain organization and highlight key features such as the activation loop, a hydrophobic regulatory spine, and a C-helix that are common in kinases (gosu2012molecularevolutionand pages 14-15).\n\n6. Regulation  \nIRAK2 is subject to multiple layers of regulation that control its activity and intracellular localization. Post-translational modifications play a central role in this regulation. For instance, upon receptor engagement (by IL-1 or TLR ligands), IRAK2 is phosphorylated – a process that is initiated by upstream kinases such as IRAK4, and may also involve autophosphorylation mechanisms (benosman2013interleukin1receptorassociatedkinase2 pages 1-3, meylan2008irak2takesits pages 2-2). In addition to phosphorylation, IRAK2 undergoes ubiquitination events that are crucial for the assembly and stabilization of the Myddosome. Notably, the interaction between IRAK2 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 leads to Lys63-linked polyubiquitination, an event that is critical for the propagation of NF-κB signaling (keating2007irak2participatesin pages 7-8, pauls2013twophasesof pages 7-8). Furthermore, recent studies have identified sumoylation as an additional regulatory modification; for example, IRAK2 is modified by RanBP2-mediated sumoylation, which is required for its translocation to the nucleus in response to LPS stimulation (zhou2017irak2directsstimulusdependent pages 16-19). These post-translational modifications influence IRAK2’s conformation, interactions with binding partners, and ultimately the duration and intensity of downstream signaling cascades.\n\n7. Function  \nIRAK2 plays pivotal roles in mediating intracellular signaling downstream of the IL-1 type I receptor and multiple Toll-like receptors. Following engagement by IL-1, the receptor complex recruits IRAK2 via its death domain, which in turn participates in the formation of the Myddosome by assembling with MyD88, IRAK4, and IRAK1. This assembly is essential for the activation of downstream signaling pathways that lead to nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation and subsequent transcriptional up-regulation of proinflammatory cytokine genes. In addition to regulating transcription, IRAK2 has been implicated in the stabilization of mRNA transcripts for cytokines and other inflammatory mediators—a function that is particularly evident in studies demonstrating its role in post-transcriptional control during endoplasmic reticulum stress as well as lipopolysaccharide-mediated immune responses (benosman2013interleukin1receptorassociatedkinase2 pages 1-3, hu2002regulationofil1 pages 5-6). IRAK2 is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues and immune cell types, where it functions as a critical mediator of innate immune responses. Its interactions with TRAF6 and involvement in the activation of downstream kinases such as TAK1 and members of the MAPK family (including JNK, p38, and ERK) position IRAK2 as a key regulator not only of inflammatory cytokine production but also of mRNA stability and processing events that control the amplification of immune signals (pauls2013twophasesof pages 1-2, yin2011thekinaseactivity pages 1-2).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nGenetic variants and mutations in IRAK2 have been linked to altered immune responses and disease outcomes. For instance, specific non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) such as the D431E variant have been associated with enhanced NF-κB activation through increased TRAF6 ubiquitination, thereby leading to elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines (zhang2014interleukin1receptorassociatedkinase2 pages 1-2, zhang2014interleukin1receptorassociatedkinase2 pages 13-13). In addition, IRAK2 deficiency, such as that resulting from exon deletions, has been implicated in immune dysregulation disorders characterized by elevated inflammatory cytokine profiles and defective Myddosome assembly (fei2024irak2deficiencycauses pages 25-31). Despite its critical signaling functions, specific small molecule inhibitors that target IRAK2 remain to be fully developed and characterized, although IRAK family inhibitors more broadly have been explored for their therapeutic potential in inflammatory and neoplastic diseases (rhyasen2015iraksignallingin pages 5-6). Overall, IRAK2 is considered a promising therapeutic target given its central role in innate immune signal transduction, and ongoing research continues to elucidate its contributions to inflammatory pathologies and potential applications in drug development.\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny:  \nIRAK3 (also known as IRAK‐M; UniProt ID Q9Y616) is a member of the interleukin‐1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) family, which belongs to the serine/threonine protein kinase superfamily. Within the human kinome, IRAK3 is grouped with other IRAK family members such as IRAK-1, IRAK-2, and IRAK-4, and it can be traced back to a common ancestral kinase found in early eukaryotes (Manning2002, Manning2002). Orthologs of IRAK3 are conserved across mammalian species, and its expression patterns are predominantly restricted to cells of the myeloid lineage, including monocytes and macrophages (flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 5-9, gan2006regulationsandroles pages 7-8). Phylogenetic analyses indicate that while the IRAK family shares a conserved death domain and central kinase domain, IRAK3 has diverged functionally from its catalytically active homologs, adopting a regulatory rather than an activating role in innate immune receptor signaling (janssens2003functionaldiversityand pages 1-2, janssens2003functionaldiversityand pages 2-3).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed:  \nAs a member of the serine/threonine kinase family, the archetypal reaction catalyzed by active kinases involves the transfer of the γ-phosphate from ATP to a serine or threonine residue on a protein substrate, thereby converting ATP into ADP alongside the phosphorylated protein and a proton. However, IRAK3 is characterized as a putative inactive kinase that does not exhibit measurable catalytic activity due to the absence of key catalytic residues; consequently, no productive phosphorylation reaction has been observed for IRAK3 (li2005il1receptor–associatedkinase pages 1-2, flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 16-20).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements:  \nActive protein kinases in the serine/threonine class typically require divalent metal ions such as Mg²⁺ as cofactors to coordinate ATP binding and catalysis. Although IRAK3 is structurally related to these kinases, its lack of catalytic function obviates the requirement for such cofactors in any measurable enzymatic reaction (li2005il1receptor–associatedkinase pages 1-2, ringwood2008theinvolvementof pages 6-8).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity:  \nIn catalytically active serine/threonine kinases, substrate recognition is typically governed by consensus motifs that direct phosphorylation to specific serine or threonine residues, with one atlas of substrate specificities reporting a preference for motifs resembling RxRxxp[ST] (Johnson2023 pages 759-766). For tyrosine kinases, substrate selectivity is determined by different amino acid preferences as outlined by studies of the tyrosine kinome (Yaron-Barir2024 pages 1174-1181). However, given that IRAK3 is classified as a pseudokinase and lacks measurable catalytic activity, it does not phosphorylate any substrates. Instead, its functional role in innate immune signaling is mediated through modulation of protein–protein interactions within receptor complexes rather than through enzymatic transfer of a phosphate group (li2005il1receptor–associatedkinase pages 1-2, flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 16-20).\n\n5. Structure:  \nIRAK3 is composed of 596 amino acids corresponding to an approximate molecular weight of 68 kDa. The protein’s domain architecture includes an N-terminal death domain (DD) that is critical for mediating interactions with other members of the receptor complex such as the adaptor protein MyD88, and a central kinase-like domain that, despite retaining the overall fold characteristic of serine/threonine kinases, lacks the conserved catalytic residues necessary for phosphotransfer activity (flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 16-20, li2005il1receptor–associatedkinase pages 1-2). In addition, IRAK3 contains a C-terminal region that includes a TRAF6-binding motif, which is important for its role in modulating downstream signaling events (flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 43-47). Structural studies based on crystallographic data and AlphaFold models indicate that while IRAK3 shares the bilobal structure seen in active kinases—with an N-terminal lobe comprised predominantly of β-sheets and a C-terminal lobe largely α-helical—the activation loop, hydrophobic spine, and C-helix are not configured in a conformation that supports catalytic activity (ringwood2008theinvolvementof pages 6-8, janssens2003functionaldiversityand pages 2-3).\n\n6. Regulation:  \nRegulation of IRAK3 occurs primarily at the level of protein expression and protein–protein interactions rather than through conventional post-translational modifications that alter enzymatic activity. Expression of IRAK3 is induced in monocytes and macrophages upon exposure to pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), contributing to the development of endotoxin tolerance (gan2006regulationsandroles pages 3-5, nguyen2020analysisofinterleukin1 pages 1-2). Although IRAK3 does not catalyze phosphorylation reactions, its regulatory function is thought to involve either the inhibition of phosphorylation of IRAK1 and IRAK4 or the stabilization of the receptor complex, thereby preventing the dissociation of these kinases (flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 16-20, li2005il1receptor–associatedkinase pages 1-2). In this capacity, IRAK3 modulates the amplitude and duration of downstream NF-κB and MAP kinase activation without itself undergoing extensive phosphorylation or ubiquitination events that are typical of active kinases (gan2006regulationsandroles pages 7-8, su2009theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 9-10).\n\n7. Function:  \nIRAK3 functions as a negative regulator within the innate immune signaling cascade that is activated by the interleukin-1 receptor (IL1R) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs). It inhibits excessive inflammatory responses by preventing the dissociation of IRAK1 and IRAK4 from the receptor complex, thereby attenuating downstream activation of NF-κB and mitigating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 16-20, ringwood2008theinvolvementof pages 5-6). In addition to its established inhibitory role, under conditions of IL33-induced lung inflammation, IRAK3 has been reported to positively regulate the expression of mRNAs encoding IL6, CSF3, CXCL2, and CCL5 in dendritic cells, highlighting a context-dependent function that can influence cytokine profiles (information section, nguyen2020analysisofinterleukin1 pages 24-25). Expression of IRAK3 is largely restricted to cells of the myeloid lineage, particularly monocytes and macrophages, where its inducible expression contributes to immune homeostasis and the prevention of hyperinflammatory states, such as those observed during endotoxin tolerance in sepsis (flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 5-9, gan2006regulationsandroles pages 3-5).\n\n8. Other Comments:  \nIRAK3 represents a potential therapeutic target for modulating inflammatory and immune-related diseases given its role as a checkpoint in TLR/IL-1R signaling. Although specific small-molecule inhibitors targeting IRAK3 have not been developed to date, its regulatory function in stabilizing receptor complexes and inhibiting the dissociation of IRAK1 and IRAK4 suggests that strategies aimed at modulating its protein–protein interactions may have therapeutic merit (flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 16-20, song2009thekinaseactivities pages 9-9). Dysregulation of IRAK3 has been implicated in conditions characterized by excessive or uncontrolled inflammation, including sepsis and chronic inflammatory disorders, emphasizing the clinical significance of maintaining proper IRAK3 function (gan2006regulationsandroles pages 3-5, ringwood2008theinvolvementof pages 5-6). Additionally, studies of other IRAK family members, such as IRAK1 and IRAK4, provide a framework for understanding how IRAK3 may be leveraged in therapeutic contexts despite its pseudokinase status (singer2018inhibitionofinterleukin1 pages 1-2, su2009theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 1-2).\n\n9.

Involved in Toll-like receptor (TLR) and IL-1R signaling pathways (PubMed:17878374). Is rapidly recruited by MYD88 to the receptor-signaling complex upon TLR activation to form the Myddosome together with IRAK2. Phosphorylates initially IRAK1, thus stimulating the kinase activity and intensive autophosphorylation of IRAK1. Phosphorylates E3 ubiquitin ligases Pellino proteins (PELI1, PELI2 and PELI3) to promote pellino-mediated polyubiquitination of IRAK1. Then, the ubiquitin-binding domain of IKBKG/NEMO binds to polyubiquitinated IRAK1 bringing together the IRAK1-MAP3K7/TAK1-TRAF6 complex and the NEMO-IKKA-IKKB complex. In turn, MAP3K7/TAK1 activates IKKs (CHUK/IKKA and IKBKB/IKKB) leading to NF-kappa-B nuclear translocation and activation. Alternatively, phosphorylates TIRAP to promote its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Phosphorylates NCF1 and regulates NADPH oxidase activation after LPS stimulation suggesting a similar mechanism during microbial infections**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nIRAK4 is a member of the interleukin‐1 receptor‐associated kinase (IRAK) family, which includes IRAK1, IRAK2, and the inactive IRAK-M. In evolutionary terms, IRAK4 can be traced to the ancient serine/threonine kinase machinery that is conserved from invertebrates to vertebrates, sharing a close relationship with the Drosophila Pelle protein that functions in Toll signaling, and is classified among the kinases that emerged in early eukaryotic evolution (janssens2003functionaldiversityand pages 1-2). Studies of the human kinome, as detailed by Manning et al. (2002), place IRAK4 within the core set of protein kinases responsible for mediating innate immune responses; its conservation across species underlines its essential role in host defense mechanisms (janssens2003functionaldiversityand pages 2-3). IRAK4 orthologs are present in all examined mammalian species, and its evolutionary relationships reveal that — while the broader IRAK family maintains a common domain organization – only IRAK1 and IRAK4 possess demonstrable catalytic activity, emphasizing the specialized and non‐redundant function of IRAK4 in signaling cascades (janssens2003functionaldiversityand pages 6-7).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nIRAK4 is an ATP-dependent serine/threonine kinase that catalyzes the transfer of a phosphoryl group from ATP to hydroxyl groups on serine or threonine residues of its substrates. In biochemical terms, the reaction can be summarized as follows:  \n  ATP + [protein] – OH → ADP + [protein] – O–PO3^2– + H^+  \nThis reaction is exemplified by IRAK4’s phosphorylation of downstream targets, notably IRAK1, Pellino proteins, and TIRAP, which serve to propagate the signal from activated Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) (bahia2015interleukin1receptorassociated pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of IRAK4, like that of other serine/threonine kinases, depends on the presence of divalent metal ion cofactors. In most in vitro and cellular contexts, Mg^2+ is required to correctly orient ATP for the phosphoryl transfer reaction, thereby facilitating efficient kinase activity (bahia2015interleukin1receptorassociated pages 5-8).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nIRAK4 preferentially phosphorylates serine and threonine residues on its substrates. Its physiological substrates include IRAK1, which is phosphorylated in an initial trans-phosphorylation event that triggers its autophosphorylation and subsequent recruitment of additional signaling molecules, as well as Pellino proteins that modulate downstream ubiquitination events. Although the explicit consensus motif has not been fully delineated, information from large-scale profiling of serine/threonine kinases indicates that many kinases in this category preferentially target substrates containing a modest consensus motif involving basic residues preceding the phospho-acceptor site; however, for IRAK4 the emphasis is on its ability to modify strategically positioned serine/threonine sites that regulate protein–protein interactions within the Myddosome (bahia2015interleukin1receptorassociated pages 3-4, chaudhary2015recentadvancesin pages 3-4, Johnson2023Atlas of substrate specificities for the human serine/threonine kinome).\n\n5. Structure  \nThe three-dimensional structure of IRAK4 has been investigated both through X-ray crystallography and advanced computational modeling. The protein comprises 460 amino acids, corresponding to a molecular mass of approximately 52 kDa, and its domain organization includes an N-terminal death domain (DD) that mediates homotypic interactions with the adaptor protein MyD88, and a central kinase domain (KD) that is responsible for its catalytic function. Structural studies reveal that the kinase domain adopts a classical bilobal fold typical of serine/threonine kinases, with a smaller N-terminal lobe predominantly composed of β-sheets and a larger C-terminal lobe composed mainly of α-helices (bahia2015interleukin1receptorassociated pages 3-4, flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 43-47). Key catalytic features within the kinase domain include the invariant lysine residue (K213), crucial for ATP binding, and an essential glutamate within the helix αC (E233), which forms a salt bridge with K213. Additionally, a unique tyrosine residue (Y262) acts as a gatekeeper, modulating access to an internal hydrophobic pocket that is targeted by selective small-molecule inhibitors (bahia2015interleukin1receptorassociated pages 5-8, kuglstatter2007cuttingedgeil1 pages 1-2). The flexible activation loop, which undergoes autophosphorylation at critical residues (such as T342, T345, and S346), modulates the conformational state of the kinase, switching it between inactive (helix C-out) and active (helix C-in) conformations (bahia2015interleukin1receptorassociated pages 3-4, patra2016recentprogressin pages 13-15).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of IRAK4 occurs at multiple levels through both intrinsic mechanisms and interactions with other signaling molecules. IRAK4 is rapidly recruited to the receptor complex upon TLR or IL-1R activation via homotypic death domain interactions with MyD88, a process which facilitates its dimerization and subsequent trans-autophosphorylation. Critical autophosphorylation events within the activation loop, including at residues T342, T345, and S346, are required for its catalytic activity and select downstream signaling (bahia2015interleukin1receptorassociated pages 3-4, fraczek2008thekinaseactivity pages 3-4). In addition, IRAK4 phosphorylates other targets such as IRAK1 and Pellino proteins to propagate the signaling cascade leading to NF-κB activation (bahia2015interleukin1receptorassociated pages 8-11). The kinase is also subject to regulation through ubiquitination processes that facilitate the formation and disassembly of the signaling complex; for example, phosphorylation of TIRAP can promote its subsequent ubiquitination and degradation, thereby modulating signal intensity (cushing2014interleukin1tolllikereceptorinduced pages 10-11, de2018mechanismofdysfunction pages 12-13). Conformational changes such as the shift from a helix C-out to a helix C-in state contribute to IRAK4’s regulation by controlling the accessibility of its active site (bahia2015interleukin1receptorassociated pages 5-8). These mechanisms collectively ensure that IRAK4 activity is tightly controlled in a cell type–specific manner, as evidenced by differential effects observed in primary human monocytes versus dermal fibroblasts (cushing2014interleukin1tolllikereceptorinduced pages 8-9).\n\n7. Function  \nIRAK4 plays a central role in initiating innate immune responses by acting as the primary kinase downstream of IL-1Rs and most TLRs. Once these receptors are engaged by their respective ligands (such as IL-1 or lipopolysaccharide), MyD88 is recruited to form the Myddosome complex together with IRAK4 and IRAK2. Within this complex, IRAK4 phosphorylates IRAK1, thereby triggering its autophosphorylation and the subsequent engagement of TRAF6. This series of phosphorylation events ultimately leads to the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) as well as the IKK complex, culminating in the nuclear translocation and activation of NF-κB and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (bahia2015interleukin1receptorassociated pages 1-2, bahia2015interleukin1receptorassociated pages 8-11). In addition to mediating cytokine expression, IRAK4 phosphorylates Pellino proteins, which are E3 ubiquitin ligases involved in the polyubiquitination of IRAK1; this modification is important for bridging the IRAK1-MAP3K7/TAK1-TRAF6 complex with the IKK complex (bahia2015interleukin1receptorassociated pages 1-2). Furthermore, IRAK4 has been linked to the regulation of NADPH oxidase activity via phosphorylation of NCF1, thus providing a connection between TLR-induced signaling and the oxidative burst during microbial infections (bahia2015interleukin1receptorassociated pages 1-2). Expression studies have shown that IRAK4 is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues and immune cell types, including monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes, which underscores its importance in both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system (chaudhary2015recentadvancesin pages 1-2). Its involvement in the inflammatory signaling cascade also provides a molecular basis for its implication in a broad range of diseases, including autoimmune disorders, inflammatory diseases, and certain cancers (de2018mechanismofdysfunction pages 1-2).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nPharmacological targeting of IRAK4 has garnered significant interest due to its crucial role in innate immune signaling and its association with several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Several small-molecule inhibitors, including compounds such as PF-06650833 developed by Pfizer and various indoloquinoline and amidopyrazole derivatives from other pharmaceutical groups, have demonstrated potent IRAK4 inhibition with nanomolar IC50 values in enzyme assays, and some of these inhibitors have advanced into clinical trials for the treatment of conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis (seganish2016inhibitorsofinterleukin1 pages 19-22, wang2009irak4inhibitorsfor pages 12-12). In addition, highly selective dual inhibitors that target both IRAK1 and IRAK4 have been characterized in inflammatory models, enabling the dissection of distinct signaling functions between these kinases (scarneo2020ahighlyselective pages 1-2, seganish2016inhibitorsofinterleukin1 pages 1-6). Notably, genetic deficiency or loss-of-function mutations in IRAK4 are associated with primary immunodeficiencies in which affected individuals show increased susceptibility to pyogenic bacterial infections, especially during childhood (ringwood2008theinvolvementof pages 5-6, de2018mechanismofdysfunction pages 1-2). These clinical observations reinforce the role of IRAK4 as a key mediator in host defense. Overall, the unique biochemical and regulatory properties of IRAK4, including its distinct activation mechanism via autophosphorylation and its immediate upstream role in assembling Myddosome complexes, have made it a promising target for therapeutic intervention in conditions driven by dysregulated inflammatory responses (cushing2014interleukin1tolllikereceptorinduced pages 11-11, patra2016recentprogressin pages 12-13).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny:  \nSerine/threonine‐protein kinase TAO1 (TAOK1), also known as MAP3K16 or MARKK, is a member of the TAO kinase family, which comprises TAOK1, TAOK2, and TAOK3. TAOK1 is evolutionarily conserved across species, with clear orthologs in invertebrates such as Drosophila (dTao) and Caenorhabditis elegans (KIN‑18), as well as in vertebrates including rodents and humans (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 1-3, byeon2024pleiotropicfunctionsof pages 3-4). Within the kinome, TAOK1 is classified among the STE20-like serine/threonine kinases and acts as a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K), functioning in core conserved signaling cascades that date back to the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor, similar to other central MAP3Ks (ma2021thousandandoneb pages 21-25, fang2020thediverseroles pages 1-3).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed:  \nTAOK1 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues on protein substrates. The overall chemical reaction is as follows:  \nATP + [protein]-(L‑serine or L‑threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L‑serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (hu2021clinicalandneurobiological pages 1-2, ma2021thousandandoneb pages 21-25).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements:  \nThe kinase activity of TAOK1 requires Mg²⁺ as a cofactor to facilitate the proper binding and orientation of ATP for efficient phosphotransfer to target substrates (hu2021clinicalandneurobiological pages 1-2, ma2021thousandandonea pages 21-25).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity:  \nTAOK1 exhibits a substrate specificity characteristic of serine/threonine kinases. It phosphorylates substrates such as MAP2K3, MAP2K6, and MARK2. Specifically, TAOK1-mediated phosphorylation of MARK2 at Thr-208 leads to its activation and subsequent phosphorylation of microtubule-associated proteins, including MAPT/TAU, thereby regulating cytoskeletal stability (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 1-3, fang2020thediverseroles pages 11-13). In addition, studies of the serine/threonine kinome demonstrate that TAO kinases tend to phosphorylate threonine residues that are followed by basic amino acids in the +2 and +3 positions (byeon2024pleiotropicfunctionsof pages 12-14, Johnson2023).\n\n5. Structure:  \nTAOK1 is a large protein composed of 1001 amino acids. Its domain architecture includes: an N-terminal catalytic kinase domain that harbors the conserved motifs typical of STE20 serine/threonine kinases—including the activation loop, the C-helix, and the hydrophobic spine—followed by a region containing coiled-coil domains and a helical bundle domain. The helical bundle domain is critical for autophosphorylation events that regulate its affinity for the plasma membrane; specifically, TAOK1 autophosphorylates at threonine residues Thr440 and Thr443, thereby modulating its subcellular localization and membrane remodeling activity (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 6-7, byeon2024pleiotropicfunctionsof pages 3-4). Structural models generated by tools such as AlphaFold suggest that while the kinase domain is well-structured, the regulatory regions may be intrinsically disordered, allowing dynamic interactions with phosphoinositides and other signaling molecules (ma2021thousandandoneb pages 21-25, fang2020thediverseroles pages 8-11).\n\n6. Regulation:  \nTAOK1 regulation is controlled primarily through phosphorylation. Autophosphorylation at Thr440 and Thr443 is a key regulatory event; when these residues are phosphorylated, TAOK1’s affinity for the plasma membrane is reduced, thereby maintaining the kinase in an active, cytosolic state. Conversely, mutation of these residues (e.g., T440A/T443A) disrupts autophosphorylation, leading to aberrant membrane binding and extensive membrane tubulation associated with neurodevelopmental defects (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 6-7, byeon2024pleiotropicfunctionsof pages 19-20). Upstream regulators such as MST3 have been implicated in phosphorylating TAOK1 as well, integrating signals from the Hippo pathway. Furthermore, TAOK1 is activated in response to stress signals, including DNA damage and G-protein coupled receptor activation, which modulate its role in both the p38/MAPK14 cascade and apoptotic pathways via the MAPK8/JNK branch (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 25-26, hu2021clinicalandneurobiological pages 3-4, woerden2021taok1isassociated pages 1-2).\n\n7. Function:  \nTAOK1 serves multiple cellular functions. It activates the p38/MAPK14 stress-activated MAPK cascade by phosphorylating the upstream kinases MAP2K3 and MAP2K6, thereby mediating cellular responses to environmental and genotoxic stress (hu2021clinicalandneurobiological pages 1-2, ma2021thousandandoneb pages 21-25). In addition, TAOK1 phosphorylates MARK2, which in turn phosphorylates tau protein (MAPT), leading to its detachment from microtubules and affecting cytoskeletal stability; this regulation is crucial for neuronal development and synaptic remodeling (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 1-3, fang2020thediverseroles pages 11-13). TAOK1 is also involved in the regulation of apoptotic processes by activating the MAPK8/JNK cascade, facilitating morphological changes such as cell contraction, membrane blebbing, and formation of apoptotic bodies. In the nervous system, TAOK1 plays an essential role in neuronal migration, cortical development, and dendritic arborization, with its proper catalytic activity being critical for normal central nervous system development (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 25-26, byeon2024pleiotropicfunctionsof pages 1-3, woerden2021taok1isassociated pages 1-2). Additionally, TAOK1 functions in G-protein coupled receptor signaling to activate the p38/MAPK14 cascade and contributes to the DNA damage checkpoint at the G2/M transition (hu2021clinicalandneurobiological pages 2-3, byeon2024pleiotropicfunctionsof pages 1-3).\n\n8. Other Comments:  \nTAOK1 is also known by alternative names such as Kinase from chicken homolog B, Prostate-derived sterile 20-like kinase 2, and Thousand and one amino acid protein kinase 1, reflecting its discovery in different experimental settings and the subsequent functional characterization. Dysregulation of TAOK1 activity, through either loss-of-function or dominant-negative mutations, has been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders including autism spectrum disorder, developmental delay, intellectual disability, and seizures. Functional studies have demonstrated that catalytically inactive mutations can trap TAOK1 at the plasma membrane, leading to abnormal membrane remodeling and dendritic growth defects (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 25-26, byeon2024pleiotropicfunctionsof pages 11-12). Although specific small-molecule inhibitors targeting TAOK1 are not yet broadly documented, there is growing interest in developing allosteric activators or inhibitors to restore normal kinase function in pathological conditions (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 6-7, fang2020thediverseroles pages 13-15). These disease associations and emerging therapeutic strategies underscore the importance of TAOK1 as a potential target for intervention in neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental pathologies.\n\n9.

May also negatively regulate cell cycle progression during unperturbed cell cycles. Following activation, phosphorylates numerous effectors preferentially at the consensus sequence [L-X-R-X-X-S/T] (PubMed:37943659). Regulates cell cycle checkpoint arrest through phosphorylation of CDC25A, CDC25B and CDC25C, inhibiting their activity. Inhibition of CDC25 phosphatase activity leads to increased inhibitory tyrosine phosphorylation of CDK-cyclin complexes and blocks cell cycle progression. May also phosphorylate NEK6 which is involved in G2/M cell cycle arrest. Regulates DNA repair through phosphorylation of BRCA2, enhancing the association of RAD51 with chromatin which promotes DNA repair by homologous recombination. Also stimulates the transcription of genes involved in DNA repair (including BRCA2) through the phosphorylation and activation of the transcription factor FOXM1. Regulates apoptosis through the phosphorylation of p53/TP53, MDM4 and PML. Phosphorylation of p53/TP53 at 'Ser-20' by CHEK2 may alleviate inhibition by MDM2, leading to accumulation of active p53/TP53. Phosphorylation of MDM4 may also reduce degradation of p53/TP53. Also controls the transcription of pro-apoptotic genes through phosphorylation of the transcription factor E2F1. Tumor suppressor, it may also have a DNA damage-independent function in mitotic spindle assembly by phosphorylating BRCA1. Its absence may be a cause of the chromosomal instability observed in some cancer cells. Promotes the CCAR2-SIRT1 association and is required for CCAR2-mediated SIRT1 inhibition (PubMed:25361978). Under oxidative stress, promotes ATG7 ubiquitination by phosphorylating the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM32 at 'Ser-55' leading to positive regulation of the autophagosme assembly (PubMed:37943659)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nSerine/threonine-protein kinase Chk2 is evolutionarily conserved across eukaryotes and is present in diverse species including yeast (where orthologs include Rad53 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Cds1 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe), invertebrates, and all higher vertebrates such as mouse, rat, zebrafish, Xenopus, and human (buscemi2014chk2kinasein pages 3-4, chaturvedi1999mammalianchk2is pages 1-2). Within the human kinome, CHK2 belongs to the checkpoint kinase family and is classified as a serine/threonine kinase that forms part of the DNA damage response (DDR) network. Its grouping within the kinome is reinforced by studies that posit its evolutionary conservation from yeast to man, as presented in the seminal works by Manning et al. (Manning2002, Manning2002). These studies position CHK2 as a member of an evolutionary core of kinases that includes other DDR effectors downstream of the apical PIKK kinases such as ATM and ATR (buscemi2014chk2kinasein pages 2-3).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCHK2 catalyzes the phosphorylation reaction in which it transfers the γ-phosphate from ATP to serine or threonine residues on its substrate proteins. The reaction proceeds as follows:  \n ATP + [substrate protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [substrate protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (buscemi2014chk2kinasein pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of CHK2, like that of most serine/threonine kinases, requires divalent metal ions as cofactors. In particular, CHK2 activity depends on the presence of Mg²⁺, which facilitates the binding of ATP within the catalytic cleft (buscemi2014chk2kinasein pages 2-3).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCHK2 displays substrate specificity characterized by a preference for phosphorylation sites that conform to the consensus sequence [L‑X‑R‑X‑X‑S/T] (buscemi2014chk2kinasein pages 5-6). This consensus motif has been elucidated in the context of serine/threonine kinases by recent large‐scale studies, including the atlas of substrate specificities for the human serine/threonine kinome (Johnson2023, as required). The leucine at the −5 position and arginine at the −3 position serve as critical determinants for substrates destined for phosphorylation by CHK2, ensuring accurate targeting to its downstream effectors (seo2003determinationofsubstrate pages 1-2).\n\n5. Structure  \nThe CHK2 protein is a 65 kDa monomer composed of 543 amino acids with a modular domain organization. Its N-terminal region comprises an SQ/TQ Cluster Domain (SCD) which contains multiple consensus phosphorylation sites for upstream PIKK kinases such as ATM and ATR (buscemi2014chk2kinasein pages 2-3, cai2009structureandactivation pages 1-2). Immediately following the SCD, CHK2 harbors a Forkhead-Associated (FHA) domain that facilitates phospho-dependent protein–protein interactions critical for dimerization and activation (buscemi2014chk2kinasein pages 3-4, ahn2004thechk2protein pages 1-2). The C-terminal part of the protein contains the canonical serine/threonine kinase domain, which is responsible for its catalytic activity. This kinase domain encompasses an ATP-binding pocket, a C-helix, and an activation loop (T-loop) that contains key autophosphorylation sites such as Thr383 and Thr387; these phosphorylation events are crucial for full activation following dimer dissociation (cai2009structureandactivation pages 1-2, buscemi2014chk2kinasein pages 2-3). Structural studies, including crystallographic analyses, have revealed that CHK2 can form dimers where trans-autophosphorylation events occur and that the FHA domain plays an essential role in stabilizing these interactions (lountos2009crystalstructureof pages 1-2, buscemi2014chk2kinasein pages 13-14). Unique structural features of CHK2 include a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and additional phosphorylation sites outside the catalytic and FHA domains that modulate its stability and substrate affinity (stolarova2020chek2germlinevariants pages 28-30).\n\n6. Regulation  \nCHK2 is regulated by a combination of phosphorylation, autophosphorylation, dephosphorylation, and ubiquitination. Activation typically begins when the ATM kinase phosphorylates CHK2 at Thr68 in the SQ/TQ cluster domain in response to DNA double-strand breaks (buscemi2014chk2kinasein pages 2-3, cai2009structureandactivation pages 1-2). This phosphorylation event promotes CHK2 dimerization through interactions between the FHA domain of one molecule and the phosphorylated SCD region of another, thereby facilitating trans-autophosphorylation at the activation loop, particularly at Thr383 and Thr387, which is essential for its full activation (buscemi2014chk2kinasein pages 15-16, stracker2009takingthetime pages 7-8). Additional phosphorylation sites, such as Ser516, further modulate CHK2’s pro-apoptotic functions (cai2009structureandactivation pages 1-2). Negative regulation is achieved via dephosphorylation by phosphatases including PP2A, PP1, and WIP1, which help terminate checkpoint signaling following DNA repair (buscemi2014chk2kinasein pages 3-4, stolarova2020chek2germlinevariants pages 5-7). Ubiquitination also plays a role in controlling CHK2 stability; for instance, PIRH2-mediated ubiquitination directs CHK2 for proteasomal degradation, thereby regulating its basal levels (buscemi2014chk2kinasein pages 13-14). Furthermore, regulatory input from other kinases such as TTK/hMps1 has been shown to phosphorylate CHK2 on Thr68, integrating mitotic checkpoint signals with DNA damage responses (wei2005ttkhmps1participatesin pages 1-2, pages 3-3).\n\n7. Function  \nCHK2 functions as a critical node in the DNA damage response and plays several roles in maintaining genomic integrity. Upon activation, CHK2 phosphorylates a wide array of downstream effectors to enforce cell cycle arrest, activate DNA repair pathways, and, when damage is irreparable, trigger apoptosis (buscemi2014chk2kinasein pages 1-2, cai2009structureandactivation pages 1-2). In the context of cell cycle regulation, CHK2 phosphorylates CDC25A, CDC25B, and CDC25C phosphatases, thereby inhibiting their activity. Inactivation of these enzymes results in the accumulation of inhibitory tyrosine phosphorylation on CDK–cyclin complexes, thus blocking progression through the cell cycle (buscemi2014chk2kinasein pages 5-6, stracker2009takingthetime pages 15-17). CHK2 also plays a role in the regulation of DNA repair processes by phosphorylating proteins such as BRCA2, which enhances the recruitment of RAD51 to chromatin, thereby promoting homologous recombination and DNA repair (buscemi2014chk2kinasein pages 5-6). Furthermore, CHK2 enhances the transcriptional activation of DNA repair genes, including BRCA2, through the phosphorylation and activation of the transcription factor FOXM1 (buscemi2014chk2kinasein pages 7-8). In terms of apoptosis, CHK2 phosphorylates key regulatory proteins such as p53 and MDM4; phosphorylation of p53 at Ser20 reduces its inhibition by MDM2, leading to p53 stabilization and activation of pro-apoptotic gene expression (buscemi2014chk2kinasein pages 7-8, chaturvedi1999mammalianchk2is pages 1-2). Additional substrates include PML and the transcription factor E2F1, thereby further integrating cell death signaling pathways with DNA damage responses (buscemi2014chk2kinasein pages 7-8). Beyond its established role in genotoxic stress, CHK2 may also have DNA damage–independent functions, such as regulating mitotic spindle assembly through the phosphorylation of BRCA1, which contributes to chromosomal stability (buscemi2014chk2kinasein pages 15-16, wu2006characterizationofchek2 pages 4-6). Expression of CHK2 is predominantly observed in proliferative cells and its activity is essential in tissues that are subjected to high levels of DNA damage, such as those with rapid cell turnover (stolarova2020chek2germlinevariants pages 28-30).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nCHK2 is recognized as a tumor suppressor kinase, and its dysfunction or mutation has been implicated in various cancers including breast, prostate, and Li-Fraumeni syndrome–like cancers (chaturvedi1999mammalianchk2is pages 1-2, wu2006characterizationofchek2 pages 6-6). Germline mutations, such as the c.1100delC variant, result in a truncated protein with compromised kinase activity and are associated with an increased risk of cancer (stolarova2020chek2germlinevariants pages 30-31). Pharmacological inhibition of CHK2 has been explored as a therapeutic strategy to sensitize tumor cells to DNA-damaging agents. Notably, the inhibitor NSC 109555 has been characterized in complex with CHK2, demonstrating potent and selective inhibition by targeting the ATP-binding site within the kinase domain (lountos2009crystalstructureof pages 1-2, pages 8-9). In addition to experimental inhibitors, ongoing studies continue to explore the therapeutic potential of CHK2 inhibitors, given its central role in the DNA damage checkpoint that governs cell survival and apoptosis (dai2010newinsightsinto pages 4-5). CHK2 is also known to promote autophagy under oxidative stress via phosphorylation of TRIM32, which subsequently leads to the ubiquitination of ATG7 and promotes autophagosome assembly (Information). Moreover, CHK2 facilitates the association of CCAR2 with SIRT1, which is required for the inhibition of SIRT1 under specific stress conditions (Information).  \n   \n9.

Exhibits kinase activity-dependent functions that regulate cell death and kinase-independent scaffold functions regulating inflammatory signaling and cell survival (PubMed:11101870, PubMed:19524512, PubMed:19524513, PubMed:29440439, PubMed:30988283). Has kinase-independent scaffold functions: upon binding of TNF to TNFR1, RIPK1 is recruited to the TNF-R1 signaling complex (TNF-RSC also known as complex I) where it acts as a scaffold protein promoting cell survival, in part, by activating the canonical NF-kappa-B pathway (By similarity). Kinase activity is essential to regulate necroptosis and apoptosis, two parallel forms of cell death: upon activation of its protein kinase activity, regulates assembly of two death-inducing complexes, namely complex IIa (RIPK1-FADD-CASP8), which drives apoptosis, and the complex IIb (RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL), which drives necroptosis (By similarity). RIPK1 is required to limit CASP8-dependent TNFR1-induced apoptosis (By similarity). In normal conditions, RIPK1 acts as an inhibitor of RIPK3-dependent necroptosis, a process mediated by RIPK3 component of complex IIb, which catalyzes phosphorylation of MLKL upon induction by ZBP1 (PubMed:19524512, PubMed:19524513, PubMed:29440439, PubMed:30988283). Inhibits RIPK3-mediated necroptosis via FADD-mediated recruitment of CASP8, which cleaves RIPK1 and limits TNF-induced necroptosis (PubMed:19524512, PubMed:19524513, PubMed:29440439, PubMed:30988283). Required to inhibit apoptosis and necroptosis during embryonic development: acts by preventing the interaction of TRADD with FADD thereby limiting aberrant activation of CASP8 (By similarity). In addition to apoptosis and necroptosis, also involved in inflammatory response by promoting transcriptional production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL6) (PubMed:31827280, PubMed:31827281). Phosphorylates RIPK3: RIPK1 and RIPK3 undergo reciprocal auto- and trans-phosphorylation (PubMed:19524513). Phosphorylates DAB2IP at 'Ser-728' in a TNF-alpha-dependent manner, and thereby activates the MAP3K5-JNK apoptotic cascade (PubMed:15310755, PubMed:17389591). Required for ZBP1-induced NF-kappa-B activation in response to DNA damage (By similarity)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny:**  \nReceptor‐interacting serine/threonine‐protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), encoded by the gene RIPK1 and also known as Cell death protein RIP or Receptor‐interacting protein 1, is a member of the serine/threonine kinase family that falls within the receptor‐interacting protein kinase (RIPK) subfamily. Orthologs of RIPK1 have been identified in a wide range of vertebrate species, indicating a highly conserved role in regulating programmed cell death and inflammatory responses throughout evolution (lv2022comparativeandevolutionary pages 1-3, amin2018regulationofa pages 1-2). Evolutionary analyses based on the protein kinase complement of the human genome have placed RIPK1 among kinases that share a conserved catalytic domain and modular architecture, and these studies have traced its origin back to early metazoans, with subsequent divergence leading to its current specialized role in cell survival and cell death signaling pathways (Manning2002Science, Manning2002Trends). Within the human kinome, phylogenetic studies reveal that RIPK1 is closely related to other members of the RIP kinase family, most notably RIPK3, with which it cooperates during necroptotic signaling, while it is more distantly related to other death domain–containing kinases involved in apoptosis and inflammatory pathways (lv2022comparativeandevolutionary pages 1-3).\n\n**2. Reaction Catalyzed:**  \nRIPK1 functions as a serine/threonine kinase and catalyzes the phosphorylation of protein substrates. The chemical reaction it catalyzes can be summarized by the equation:  \nATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺.  \nThis reaction describes the transfer of the gamma-phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues present in its substrate proteins, which is a hallmark of serine/threonine kinase activity (chen2022advancesinripk1 pages 1-2, johnson2023anatlasof pages 1-2).\n\n**3. Cofactor Requirements:**  \nThe enzymatic activity of RIPK1 is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions. In particular, Mg²⁺ is required to properly coordinate the binding of ATP within the catalytic site and to facilitate the phosphoryl transfer to the substrate. This requirement is consistent with the general mechanism of action observed for serine/threonine kinases, whereby these metal ions stabilize the negative charges of ATP's phosphate groups during catalysis (ku2014developmentandapplication pages 1-8).\n\n**4. Substrate Specificity:**  \nRIPK1 exhibits substrate specificity in a manner characteristic of serine/threonine kinases. Recent studies have examined the substrate preferences of many kinases, and comprehensive substrate specificity atlases have provided insights into the phosphorylation motifs recognized by RIPK1 (johnson2023anatlasof pages 10-11). For example, RIPK1 engages in reciprocal phosphorylation with RIPK3 during necroptosis, a process wherein both kinases activate one another via mutual phosphorylation events. In addition, RIPK1 phosphorylates DAB2IP at the Ser-728 residue in a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα)–dependent manner, thereby triggering the downstream activation of the MAP3K5–JNK apoptotic cascade (amin2018regulationofa pages 1-2, chen2022advancesinripk1 pages 1-2). Although a single consensus substrate motif for RIPK1 has not been definitively established, its phosphorylation of target serine and threonine residues generally depends on the local amino acid sequence context, which provides an optimal environment for catalytic recognition and efficient phosphoryl transfer (johnson2023anatlasof pages 10-11, chen2022advancesinripk1 pages 1-2).\n\n**5. Structure:**  \nRIPK1 is a multidomain protein whose structure supports its dual functionality as both an active kinase and a scaffolding molecule. The protein is organized into distinct functional regions. At its N-terminus, RIPK1 harbors a serine/threonine kinase domain that is responsible for its catalytic activity. This kinase domain features several conserved elements common to eukaryotic kinases, including an ATP-binding cleft, a conserved activation loop that is critical for its regulatory phosphorylation events, a hydrophobic spine that aligns key catalytic residues, and a regulatory C-helix that contributes to the stabilization of its active conformation (johnson2023anatlasof pages 4-4, ku2014developmentandapplication pages 1-8).\n\nImmediately following the kinase domain, RIPK1 contains an intermediate region that includes the RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM). The RHIM is essential for mediating homotypic interactions with other RHIM-containing proteins, most notably RIPK3. This interaction is critical for the formation of necrosomes, which are complexes that drive the necroptotic cell death pathway. Studies based on AlphaFold models and experimental observations indicate that the RHIM facilitates amyloid-like assembly, thereby enabling the propagation of necroptotic signaling (karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 15-17, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 18-19).\n\nAt the C-terminal end of the protein, RIPK1 features a death domain (DD). This domain is responsible for mediating protein–protein interactions that are crucial for the recruitment of RIPK1 into receptor complexes such as the TNF receptor signaling complex I (TNF-RSC). The death domain allows RIPK1 to function as a scaffold in assembling multi-protein complexes that help activate the canonical NF-κB pathway, thereby promoting cell survival and the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes (johnson2023anatlasof pages 21-23, martens2020inhibitorstargetingripk1ripk3 pages 4-6). Thus, the overall domain organization of RIPK1—with the N-terminal kinase domain, the intermediary RHIM, and the C-terminal death domain—underpins its bifunctional role in cell signaling.\n\n**6. Regulation:**  \nRIPK1 is subject to complex regulation by a variety of post-translational modifications that dictate its activity and its decision to promote cell survival or cell death. Phosphorylation is a central regulatory mechanism for RIPK1. The protein can undergo autophosphorylation as well as phosphorylation by partnering kinases such as IKK1/2, TAK1, MK2, and TBK1. Such phosphorylation events typically occur on key serine/threonine residues and usually exert an inhibitory effect on RIPK1’s kinase activity, thus preventing unwanted activation of downstream cell death pathways (johnson2023anatlasof pages 18-20, liu2021regulatorymechanismsof pages 1-2). For instance, TBK1 and IKKε have been shown to phosphorylate RIPK1 on specific residues, suppressing its kinase activity and thereby mitigating TNF-induced cell death (lafont2018tbk1andikkε pages 15-16).\n\nIn addition to phosphorylation, ubiquitination is a critical regulatory modification affecting RIPK1. Within the TNF receptor signaling complex I, RIPK1 is modified by K63-linked as well as linear (M1-linked) ubiquitin chains. These ubiquitin modifications, catalyzed by E3 ubiquitin ligases including cIAP1/2 and the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), serve to stabilize RIPK1’s scaffold function, facilitating the recruitment of downstream signaling molecules that activate NF-κB and MAPK pathways (martens2020inhibitorstargetingripk1ripk3 pages 2-4). Conversely, deubiquitinating enzymes such as CYLD and A20 remove these ubiquitin moieties, which shifts RIPK1 from a pro-survival scaffold state toward an active kinase conformation that is able to participate in the assembly of death-inducing complexes (liu2021regulatorymechanismsof pages 2-2, martens2020inhibitorstargetingripk1ripk3 pages 2-4).\n\nFurthermore, proteolytic cleavage by caspase-8 represents an important regulatory circuit. Caspase-8 cleaves RIPK1, thereby limiting its kinase activity and preventing excessive formation of death-inducing complexes that lead to apoptosis or necroptosis. This proteolytic event acts as a negative feedback mechanism that tightly regulates the balance between cell survival and cell death responses (liu2021regulatorymechanismsof pages 2-2, martens2020inhibitorstargetingripk1ripk3 pages 2-4). The interplay among these modifications—phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and caspase-mediated cleavage—determines the functional state of RIPK1 and ultimately influences whether the cell engages in pro-survival or pro-death signaling.\n\n**7. Function:**  \nRIPK1 is a pivotal regulator of cell fate downstream of death receptors, notably tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1). In settings where TNF binds to TNFR1, RIPK1 is recruited to the TNF receptor signaling complex I (TNF-RSC), where it performs an essential scaffolding function. Through this function, RIPK1 facilitates the activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway, resulting in the transcription of pro-survival and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) (johnson2023anatlasof pages 12-18). The scaffold function of RIPK1 ensures cell survival by promoting NF-κB and MAPK signaling cascades.\n\nUnder conditions where its kinase activity is activated, RIPK1 plays a central role in the commitment to cell death. When RIPK1’s kinase function is unleashed—often as a consequence of the removal or inhibition of its ubiquitination and inhibitory phosphorylation—it promotes the assembly of two distinct death-inducing complexes. In complex IIa, RIPK1 interacts with FADD and caspase-8 leading to apoptosis through caspase activation. Conversely, in complex IIb (commonly referred to as the necrosome), RIPK1 forms a functional complex with RIPK3 and MLKL that drives necroptosis, a programmed form of necrosis (amin2018regulationofa pages 1-2, martens2020inhibitorstargetingripk1ripk3 pages 1-2). Notably, RIPK1 also restricts RIPK3-dependent necroptosis under normal physiological conditions by recruiting FADD and caspase-8, with caspase-8 cleaving RIPK1 to attenuate the necroptotic signal (liu2021regulatorymechanismsof pages 1-2, li2019humanripk1deficiency pages 1-1).\n\nIn addition to its roles in cell death, RIPK1 is crucial for modulating inflammatory responses. Its activity influences the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the activation of transcription factors such as NF-κB, thereby linking death receptor signaling to inflammatory gene expression. The reciprocal phosphorylation between RIPK1 and RIPK3 forms a feed-forward loop that amplifies signaling required for both apoptotic and necroptotic cell death pathways, ensuring that the appropriate death modality is executed in response to cellular stresses (chen2022advancesinripk1 pages 22-23, johnson2023anatlasof pages 18-20). RIPK1 is also known to phosphorylate DAB2IP at Ser-728, which subsequently triggers the MAP3K5-JNK apoptotic cascade, thereby establishing a connection between TNF-induced kinase signaling and the activation of stress-responsive apoptotic pathways (amin2018regulationofa pages 1-2, johnson2023anatlasof pages 10-11).\n\nExpression of RIPK1 is relatively widespread, with elevated levels typically found in tissues that are exposed to high levels of inflammatory or stress signals, including various components of the immune system and barrier tissues. During embryonic development, RIPK1 is indispensable; it prevents excessive cell death by inhibiting both caspase-8–mediated apoptosis and RIPK3-mediated necroptosis, a function that is critical for proper tissue morphogenesis and immune regulation (liu2023ripk1inthe pages 2-3, li2019humanripk1deficiency pages 1-1).\n\n**8. Other Comments:**  \nDue to its central role in orchestrating cell death and inflammatory responses, RIPK1 has emerged as an attractive therapeutic target, particularly for conditions characterized by aberrant inflammation and tissue degeneration. Several small-molecule inhibitors have been developed that selectively target the kinase activity of RIPK1 without disrupting its essential scaffolding functions that promote cell survival through NF-κB activation. Notable among these are necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) and its improved analogs, as well as compounds such as GSK2982772, which have advanced into clinical trials for inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and psoriasis (martens2020inhibitorstargetingripk1ripk3 pages 6-8, degterev2019targetingripk1for pages 1-2). In addition, comprehensive substrate specificity studies have provided further insights into the enzymology of RIPK1 with respect to its serine/threonine kinase activity, and recent work addressing the intrinsic substrate specificity of kinases—both serine/threonine and tyrosine—has underscored the dual-specificity features that may pertain to related kinases (johnson2023anatlasof pages 1-2, Yaron-Barir2024).  \n\nMutations in RIPK1 that affect either its catalytic function or its ability to properly engage in scaffolding have been linked to severe human disorders. For instance, biallelic loss-of-function mutations in RIPK1 have been associated with combined immunodeficiency and inflammatory bowel diseases, highlighting its critical role in regulating immune responses and maintaining intestinal epithelial homeostasis (li2019humanripk1deficiency pages 1-1). Such disease-associated mutations underline the importance of precisely regulating RIPK1 activity to prevent pathological inflammation and cell death. Ongoing research continues to clarify the broader therapeutic window and the potential risks associated with targeting RIPK1 in various clinical settings (meng2021theregulationof pages 7-7).\n\nFinally, the dual functionality of RIPK1 as both a kinase and a scaffolding protein necessitates a careful balance in drug design; selective inhibition of its kinase activity must be achieved without compromising the cell survival functions mediated by its scaffold properties. This complexity has fostered the development of next-generation inhibitors that aim to achieve this balance, making RIPK1 one of the most intensively studied targets in the field of inflammatory and cell death-related diseases (martens2020inhibitorstargetingripk1ripk3 pages 6-8, degterev2019targetingripk1for pages 1-2).\n\n**9.

Acts as a key effector of NOD1 and NOD2 signaling pathways: upon activation by bacterial peptidoglycans, NOD1 and NOD2 oligomerize and recruit RIPK2 via CARD-CARD domains, leading to the formation of RIPK2 filaments (PubMed:17054981, PubMed:17562858, PubMed:21123652, PubMed:22607974, PubMed:28656966, PubMed:29452636, PubMed:30026309). Once recruited, RIPK2 autophosphorylates and undergoes 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination by E3 ubiquitin ligases XIAP, BIRC2 and BIRC3, as well as 'Met-1'-linked (linear) polyubiquitination by the LUBAC complex, becoming a scaffolding protein for downstream effectors (PubMed:22607974, PubMed:28545134, PubMed:29452636, PubMed:30026309, PubMed:30279485, PubMed:30478312). 'Met-1'-linked polyubiquitin chains attached to RIPK2 recruit IKBKG/NEMO, which undergoes 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination in a RIPK2-dependent process (PubMed:17562858, PubMed:22607974, PubMed:29452636, PubMed:30026309). 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains attached to RIPK2 serve as docking sites for TAB2 and TAB3 and mediate the recruitment of MAP3K7/TAK1 to IKBKG/NEMO, inducing subsequent activation of IKBKB/IKKB (PubMed:18079694). In turn, NF-kappa-B is released from NF-kappa-B inhibitors and translocates into the nucleus where it activates the transcription of hundreds of genes involved in immune response, growth control, or protection against apoptosis (PubMed:18079694). The protein kinase activity is dispensable for the NOD1 and NOD2 signaling pathways (PubMed:29452636, PubMed:30026309). Contributes to the tyrosine phosphorylation of the guanine exchange factor ARHGEF2 through Src tyrosine kinase leading to NF-kappa-B activation by NOD2 (PubMed:21887730). Also involved in adaptive immunity: plays a role during engagement of the T-cell receptor (TCR) in promoting BCL10 phosphorylation and subsequent NF-kappa-B activation (PubMed:14638696). Plays a role in the inactivation of RHOA in response to NGFR signaling (PubMed:26646181)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nReceptor‐interacting serine/threonine‐protein kinase 2 (RIPK2) belongs to the RIP kinase family, a subgroup within the tyrosine‐kinase‐like (TKL) superfamily of protein kinases. RIPK2 is evolutionarily conserved across vertebrates, and its orthologs can be found in all mammalian species, indicating that its functions in immune regulation have been maintained during evolution (nikhar2021…ofpyridoa pages 1-3). Within the kinase complement, RIPK2 is phylogenetically distinct from related kinases such as RIPK1 and RIPK3, which display specialized roles in cell death pathways, while RIPK2 is uniquely adapted as a signaling adaptor in innate immunity (zare2022theroleof pages 32-35, topal2021ripk2nodsto pages 1-6). Moreover, this kinase is part of an evolutionarily ancient set of signaling molecules that emerged early during the evolution of eukaryotes; similar to many kinases described by Manning and colleagues, RIPK2 is a core component in cellular signal transduction that has diversified in higher organisms (nikhar2021…ofpyridoa pages 26-28).  \n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nRIPK2 catalyzes a classical protein phosphorylation reaction using ATP as a phosphate donor. In this reaction, ATP and a protein substrate containing serine, threonine and, under certain conditions, tyrosine residues are converted to ADP and a phosphorylated protein with the release of a proton. This reaction can be summarized as:  \n  ATP + [protein]–(L-serine/threonine/tyrosine) → ADP + [protein]–phosphate + H⁺ (misehe2024designsynthesisand pages 44-49, nikhar2021…ofpyridoa pages 1-3).  \n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of RIPK2, like most kinases, is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions. In particular, magnesium ions (Mg²⁺) are essential for its enzymatic function as they coordinate ATP binding within the active site of the kinase domain (misehe2024designsynthesisand pages 44-49, shen2025currentadvanceson pages 1-2).  \n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nRIPK2 has been characterized as a dual‐specificity protein kinase with a predominant activity toward serine/threonine phosphorylation and emerging evidence for tyrosine phosphorylation in appropriate contexts. Kinome-wide profiling studies have provided detailed insight into substrate motifs for serine/threonine kinases, and RIPK2 appears to display substrate preferences similar to those reported in Johnson et al. (2023) for the serine/threonine kinome. Additionally, recent data support that RIPK2 can phosphorylate tyrosine residues on specific substrates, as highlighted by Yaron-Barir et al. (2024), which further reinforces the dual-specificity nature of this enzyme (nikhar2021…ofpyrido pages 26-28, pham2023recentadvancesin pages 17-18, you2023ripk2apromising pages 13-14). The consensus motif for its serine/threonine activity has not been fully delineated; however, the intrinsic substrate specificity studies indicate that the kinase core engages substrates through a typical linear motif that is optimally phosphorylated when presented in an appropriate structural context (pham2023recentadvancesin pages 1-3, zare2022theroleof pages 35-39).  \n\n5. Structure  \nRIPK2 is composed of an N-terminal kinase domain and a C-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD). The kinase domain is responsible for its catalytic activity and displays the conserved bilobal structure characteristic of protein kinases with a smaller N-lobe dominated by a glycine-rich loop and a larger C-lobe that contains the activation segment, including key motifs such as the DFG motif, the HRD motif in the catalytic loop, and a conserved catalytic lysine that coordinates ATP binding (misehe2024designsynthesisand pages 44-49, pellegrini2017structuresofthe pages 1-2). Crystal structures and AlphaFold models of RIPK2 reveal that its kinase domain not only adopts a canonical fold but also is capable of dimerization – a feature critical for its autophosphorylation and subsequent activation. Dimerization occurs in a side-by-side arrangement where the N-lobe of one monomer interfaces with the C-lobe of its partner, stabilizing the activation loop and facilitating trans-autophosphorylation events; these structural arrangements are well supported by data from crystallographic studies and are consistent with the general principles of kinase activation (nikhar2021…ofpyridoa pages 1-3, lethier2023structureshowsthat pages 1-2). In contrast, the CARD domain at the C-terminus mediates homotypic interactions with other CARD-containing proteins such as NOD1 and NOD2. This domain is essential for the assembly of higher order signaling complexes or “RIPosomes” that function as scaffolds for downstream signal propagation (shen2025currentadvanceson pages 2-3, zare2022theroleofa pages 32-35). Unique structural features include the disposition of the activation loop, which includes key autophosphorylation sites such as serine 176 and tyrosine 474, residues that have been implicated in conformational shifts necessary for full enzymatic activity and optimal scaffolding function (nikhar2021…ofpyridoa pages 26-28, zare2022theroleof pages 35-39). Additionally, structural studies have identified a hydrophobic pocket near residue K209 in the kinase domain, which has been shown to serve as a regulatory interface for interacting with the BIR2 domain of the E3 ubiquitin ligase XIAP (heim2020aregulatoryinterface pages 7-9, nachbur2015aripk2inhibitor pages 1-2).  \n\n6. Regulation  \nThe activity and function of RIPK2 are tightly controlled by multiple post-translational modifications (PTMs) that affect its catalytic activity, protein–protein interactions, stability, and subcellular localization. Autophosphorylation is a key initial regulatory event; RIPK2 autophosphorylates within its activation loop – notably at serine 176 – which is critical for its full activation, and phosphorylation at tyrosine 474 is essential for maximal NOD2 signaling via NF-κB activation (pellegrini2017structuresofthe pages 1-2, zare2022theroleof pages 35-39). In addition to autophosphorylation, RIPK2 is subject to extensive Lys63-linked polyubiquitination, mediated primarily by E3 ubiquitin ligases such as XIAP, BIRC2, and BIRC3. Later, the linear (Met1-linked) polyubiquitination by the LUBAC complex further modulates downstream signaling by recruiting adaptor molecules including IKBKG/NEMO and facilitating the activation of TAK1, ultimately leading to NF-κB activation (misehe2024designsynthesisand pages 44-49, topal2021ripk2nodsto pages 11-15). Specific lysine residues, such as K209, play a regulatory role in this modification process. Although ubiquitination at K209 has been proposed, mutagenesis studies have revealed that alteration of K209 (e.g. K209R) results in impaired ubiquitination and diminished NF-κB activation, likely due to disruption of a structural regulatory interface rather than solely a loss of a ubiquitin acceptor site (heim2020aregulatoryinterface pages 7-9, nachbur2015aripk2inhibitor pages 1-2). Moreover, residues in the hydrophobic pocket around K209 and I212 have been shown to affect the binding of XIAP, which is essential for propagating the ubiquitin signal; mutation of I212 to a polar residue (I212D) abolishes ubiquitination and downstream signaling, whereas a more conservative mutation such as I212A can enhance activity (heim2020aregulatoryinterface pages 7-9, zare2022theroleofa pages 35-39). Collectively, these PTMs operate in a coordinated manner: phosphorylation activates and structurally primes the kinase while ubiquitination, primarily of the Lys63-linked type, converts RIPK2 into a robust scaffolding platform that recruits and organizes downstream signaling effectors (shen2025currentadvanceson pages 12-13, ellwanger2019xiapcontrolsripk2 pages 13-14).  \n\n7. Function  \nRIPK2 plays a central role in connecting innate immune detection with the activation of inflammatory signaling pathways. Functionally, it is recruited by the cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors NOD1 and NOD2 upon binding bacterial peptidoglycan components, such as muramyl dipeptide. This recruitment occurs via homotypic CARD-CARD interactions, which lead to the assembly of higher order signaling complexes known as RIPosomes. Once activated, RIPK2 autophosphorylates and undergoes specific ubiquitination events, thereby serving as a platform for recruiting the TAK1 kinase complex, IKK complex, and other downstream signaling molecules necessary for NF-κB and MAPK pathway activation (nikhar2021…ofpyridoa pages 1-3, topal2021ripk2nodsto pages 1-6, shen2025currentadvanceson pages 12-13). Additionally, RIPK2 contributes to adaptive immunity by participating in T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling and by promoting the phosphorylation of key adaptor proteins such as BCL10, further linking innate and adaptive immune responses (nikhar2021…ofpyridoa pages 1-3, shen2025currentadvanceson pages 13-13). Expression of RIPK2 is broad, with significant levels found in immune cells, including macrophages, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes, as well as in epithelial cells lining mucosal surfaces, where it plays a critical role in the host defense against pathogens (you2023ripk2apromising pages 1-2, topal2021ripk2nodsto pages 6-11). Moreover, RIPK2 signaling is implicated in the regulation of autophagy, a process that further modulates immune responses and maintains cellular homeostasis. This multifaceted role in immune signaling has also linked RIPK2 to various pathological conditions, including chronic inflammatory diseases (such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis) and certain forms of cancer, where aberrant activation of NF-κB and inflammatory cytokine production contribute to tumor progression (zare2022theroleofb pages 62-65, you2023ripk2apromising pages 6-7).  \n\n8. Other Comments  \nRIPK2 has attracted considerable attention as a drug target due to its central role in the regulation of both innate and adaptive immune responses. Numerous small molecule inhibitors have been developed to interfere with its kinase and scaffolding functions; examples include ATP-competitive compounds such as WEHI-345, ponatinib, and more selective inhibitors like GSK583. Some of these inhibitors function by directly occupying the ATP-binding site, while others exert their effects by allosterically disrupting the interaction between RIPK2 and XIAP, thereby suppressing the polyubiquitination necessary for downstream NF-κB activation (hrdinka2018smallmoleculeinhibitors pages 1-2, you2023ripk2apromising pages 6-7). In addition, proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) strategies have been explored to induce selective degradation of RIPK2 as an alternative therapeutic strategy (you2023ripk2apromising pages 6-7). Disease associations for RIPK2 extend to several inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, including Crohn’s disease, Blau syndrome, and multiple sclerosis, and emerging studies also suggest a role in certain cancers, such as inflammatory breast cancer, where overexpression or amplification of RIPK2 correlates with poor prognosis (zare2022theroleofb pages 62-65, you2023ripk2apromising pages 1-2). Notable mutations and alterations in the regulatory domains, particularly those affecting key residues such as K209 and I212 in the kinase domain, have been shown to disrupt XIAP binding and impair normal immune signaling. These findings underscore the potential impact of genetic variations in RIPK2 on disease susceptibility and progression (heim2020aregulatoryinterface pages 7-9, nachbur2015aripk2inhibitor pages 1-2).  \n\n9.

Necroptosis, a programmed cell death process in response to death-inducing TNF-alpha family members, is triggered by RIPK3 following activation by ZBP1 (PubMed:19524512, PubMed:19524513, PubMed:22265413, PubMed:22265414, PubMed:22421439, PubMed:29883609, PubMed:32298652). Activated RIPK3 forms a necrosis-inducing complex and mediates phosphorylation of MLKL, promoting MLKL localization to the plasma membrane and execution of programmed necrosis characterized by calcium influx and plasma membrane damage (PubMed:19524512, PubMed:19524513, PubMed:22265413, PubMed:22265414, PubMed:22421439, PubMed:25316792, PubMed:29883609). In addition to TNF-induced necroptosis, necroptosis can also take place in the nucleus in response to orthomyxoviruses infection: following ZBP1 activation, which senses double-stranded Z-RNA structures, nuclear RIPK3 catalyzes phosphorylation and activation of MLKL, promoting disruption of the nuclear envelope and leakage of cellular DNA into the cytosol (By similarity). Also regulates apoptosis: apoptosis depends on RIPK1, FADD and CASP8, and is independent of MLKL and RIPK3 kinase activity (By similarity). Phosphorylates RIPK1: RIPK1 and RIPK3 undergo reciprocal auto- and trans-phosphorylation (PubMed:19524513). In some cell types, also able to restrict viral replication by promoting cell death-independent responses (By similarity). In response to Zika virus infection in neurons, promotes a cell death-independent pathway that restricts viral replication: together with ZBP1, promotes a death-independent transcriptional program that modifies the cellular metabolism via up-regulation expression of the enzyme ACOD1/IRG1 and production of the metabolite itaconate (By similarity). Itaconate inhibits the activity of succinate dehydrogenase, generating a metabolic state in neurons that suppresses replication of viral genomes (By similarity). RIPK3 binds to and enhances the activity of three metabolic enzymes: GLUL, GLUD1, and PYGL (PubMed:19498109). These metabolic enzymes may eventually stimulate the tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, which could result in enhanced ROS production (PubMed:19498109)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nReceptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 3 (RIPK3), also known as RIP3, is a member of the receptor‐interacting protein kinase family, which is characterized by a conserved N‐terminal kinase domain and a key C‐terminal RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM) shared with several other RIP kinases such as RIPK1. (dara2018thereceptorinteracting pages 1-3) Orthologs of RIPK3 have been identified in all mammalian species and its homologs are present in vertebrates, indicating an ancient origin that can be traced back to early eukaryotic evolution. (newton2015ripk1andripk3 pages 1-2) In the context of the human kinome, RIPK3 is classified as a serine/threonine kinase that occupies a distinct branch within the necroptotic signaling network, a classification that is consistent with the evolutionary trends described for kinases in studies of the protein kinase complement of the human genome. (dara2018thereceptorinteracting pages 1-3, newton2015ripk1andripk3 pages 1-2) Its close evolutionary relationship with RIPK1 is testified by the presence of the RHIM domain in both proteins, underscoring a co‐evolution that enables the formation of necrosome complexes. (dara2018thereceptorinteracting pages 1-3)\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nRIPK3 catalyzes the phosphorylation reaction in which the γ‐phosphate from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is transferred to specific serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins. (dara2018thereceptorinteracting pages 3-4) In its canonical activity, RIPK3 phosphorylates the pseudokinase mixed lineage kinase domain‐like protein (MLKL), resulting in the conversion of ATP to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) alongside the generation of a phosphorylated substrate and a proton; that is, ATP + [protein]–(Ser/Thr) → ADP + [protein]–(Ser/Thr)-phosphate + H⁺. (liu2021ripk3signalingand pages 1-2)\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nLike many serine/threonine protein kinases, RIPK3 requires divalent metal ions such as Mg²⁺ as a cofactor to coordinate ATP binding and ensure proper catalytic activity. (dara2018thereceptorinteracting pages 3-4)\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nRIPK3 exhibits substrate specificity for the phosphorylation of downstream effectors that are central to the execution of necroptosis. (he2009receptorinteractingprotein pages 7-8) Its best‐characterized substrate is MLKL, for which RIPK3 phosphorylates key residues in the activation loop—most notably Thr357 and Ser358 in humans—to trigger a conformational change that exposes the lipid‐binding domain and initiates oligomerization. (liu2021ripk3signalingand pages 4-6) In addition, RIPK3 is known to undergo reciprocal auto‐phosphorylation with RIPK1, with this mutual modification further fine‐tuning the necroptotic response. (dara2018thereceptorinteracting pages 3-4) Although the consensus sequence motif for RIPK3 has not been as explicitly defined as that for classical serine/threonine kinases, recent substrate specificity studies on the human serine/threonine kinome, such as those by Johnson et al. (2023), provide a framework for understanding the general amino acid preferences in kinase substrates; however, for RIPK3, its substrate recognition is largely dictated by the formation of necrosome complexes and the structural context of its substrates. (liu2021ripk3signalingand pages 1-2, Johnson2023)\n\n5. Structure  \nRIPK3 is a protein of approximately 518 amino acids in humans and contains two major structural domains: an N‐terminal serine/threonine kinase domain and a C‐terminal RHIM domain. (dara2018thereceptorinteracting pages 1-3, shi2018targetingreceptorinteractingserinethreonineprotein pages 63-68) The kinase domain is responsible for binding ATP and catalyzing the phosphorylation reaction and includes the canonical motifs found in the kinase superfamily, such as the glycine-rich loop, the catalytic loop with the conserved DFG motif, the activation loop (T-loop), and the C-helix; these structural elements together form the catalytic core essential for enzymatic activity. (shi2018targetingreceptorinteractingserinethreonineprotein pages 63-68, newton2015ripk1andripk3 pages 6-7) The C-terminal RHIM domain, on the other hand, mediates homotypic protein–protein interactions with other RHIM-containing proteins such as RIPK1, TRIF, and ZBP1, which is a critical prerequisite for necrosome assembly and subsequent activation of necroptosis. (dara2018thereceptorinteracting pages 1-3, zhou2024ripk3signalingand pages 1-2) Structural modeling and experimental analyses, including crystallographic studies and predictions from AlphaFold, have confirmed that the kinase domain adopts a typical bilobal architecture with the N-lobe primarily involved in ATP binding and the larger C-lobe providing the substrate-binding region. (shi2018targetingreceptorinteractingserinethreonineprotein pages 68-75)\n\n6. Regulation  \nRIPK3 is regulated by multiple post-translational modifications that influence its catalytic activity and the type of cell death pathway executed. (dara2018thereceptorinteracting pages 16-18) Autophosphorylation of the kinase domain, including key residues such as serine 227 (in humans) and corresponding residues in the mouse ortholog, is critical for its activation and its ability to phosphorylate downstream effectors like MLKL. (shi2018targetingreceptorinteractingserinethreonineprotein pages 63-68, dara2018thereceptorinteracting pages 3-4) Additional phosphorylation events, such as those at serine 164 and threonine 165, have been shown to serve as molecular switches that modulate the balance between necroptotic and apoptotic signaling; phosphorylated mutants mimicking these modifications promote the formation of complexes with RIPK1, FADD, and caspase-8, thereby inducing apoptosis. (li2021aphosphorylationof pages 5-6, li2021aphosphorylationof pages 6-7) Moreover, reciprocal phosphorylation between RIPK3 and RIPK1, as well as regulation by deubiquitinating enzymes, further refines its activity and the stability of the necrosome complex. (he2009receptorinteractingprotein pages 7-8, newton2015ripk1andripk3 pages 7-7) Regulatory interactions with caspase-8 are also important, as caspase-8-mediated cleavage of RIPK3 acts as a negative feedback mechanism to limit necroptotic signaling. (dara2018thereceptorinteracting pages 16-18)\n\n7. Function  \nRIPK3 is a multifunctional kinase that plays a central role in mediating regulated cell death and inflammatory responses. (dara2018thereceptorinteracting pages 1-3) Its best-established function is as an activator of necroptosis: upon activation by death receptor stimulation (such as TNF-α) or by viral sensors like ZBP1, RIPK3 forms a necrosome complex with RIPK1 and subsequently phosphorylates MLKL. (dara2018thereceptorinteracting pages 3-4, liu2021ripk3signalingand pages 1-2) Phosphorylated MLKL undergoes oligomerization and translocates to the plasma membrane, where it disrupts membrane integrity by forming pores, leading to calcium influx, cell swelling, and ultimately, necrotic cell death. (dara2018thereceptorinteracting pages 3-4, liu2021ripk3signalingand pages 4-6) In addition to driving necroptosis, RIPK3 is involved in apoptosis signaling in certain cellular contexts; when its kinase activity is compromised or its regulatory phosphorylation pattern is altered, RIPK3 can recruit RIPK1, FADD, and caspase-8 to initiate apoptosis independent of MLKL. (mandal2014rip3inducesapoptosis pages 15-15, li2021aphosphorylationof pages 6-7) Beyond cell death, RIPK3 influences inflammatory signaling by promoting the transcriptional upregulation of cytokines and chemokines through NF-κB and MAPK pathways, and it can indirectly restrict viral replication via cell death-independent mechanisms, as evidenced in studies involving Zika virus infection in neurons. (dara2018thereceptorinteracting pages 9-11, ying2021theroleof pages 3-4) Furthermore, RIPK3 has been shown to bind and enhance the enzymatic activities of metabolic enzymes such as GLUL, GLUD1, and PYGL, which may lead to increased tricarboxylic acid cycle activity and heightened reactive oxygen species production, linking its activity to cellular metabolic reprogramming. (Information section, liu2021ripk3signalingand pages 1-2)\n\n8. Other Comments  \nRIPK3 is an attractive therapeutic target due to its pivotal role in necroptosis and inflammatory diseases. (chung2022highreceptorinteractingserinethreonineprotein pages 1-2) Experimental inhibitors, including necrostatins that primarily target RIPK1 and indirectly modulate RIPK3 activity, have shown promising effects in preclinical models of ischemia-reperfusion injury, liver disease, and neurodegeneration. (fayaz2016novelripk3inhibitors pages 1-1, martens2020inhibitorstargetingripk1ripk3 pages 2-4) Moreover, structure-based drug design efforts have led to the identification of novel RIPK3 inhibitors that offer neuroprotection in post-ischemic settings. (fayaz2016novelripk3inhibitors pages 1-1, martens2020inhibitorstargetingripk1ripk3 pages 4-6) Mutations affecting RIPK3 activity, such as kinase‐dead variants (e.g., D161N), have been associated with embryonic lethality in murine models, underscoring the essential nature of its kinase function in development. (dara2018thereceptorinteracting pages 22-27, newton2015ripk1andripk3 pages 7-7) Additionally, aberrant or elevated expression of RIPK3 has been linked to pathological conditions including chronic liver diseases, certain cancers, and cardiovascular disorders, further emphasizing the role of RIPK3 in disease progression and the potential benefits of its pharmacological inhibition. (dara2018thereceptorinteracting pages 9-11, deroo2020theroleof pages 11-13) The dual functionality of RIPK3 in mediating both necroptosis and apoptosis—as well as its involvement in metabolic reprogramming—necessitates careful consideration in the development of selective inhibitors.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nRIPK4 (Receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 4), also known as ANKRD3 or DIK, is a member of the serine/threonine kinase superfamily that emerged as part of the receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK) grouping. Comparative genomic analyses, as described in seminal works on the human kinome, place RIPK4 within a distinct subgroup often classified in the RIPK/WNK cluster, which is evolutionarily related to other receptor‐interacting protein kinases and shares motif–selectivity characteristics with these kinases (johnson2023anatlasof pages 2-3, krupa2002therepertoireof pages 1-2). Phylogenetic studies using sequence similarity and domain architecture consistently reveal that RIPK4 is conserved across vertebrate species, with orthologs identifiable in mammals and other higher eukaryotes, while its emergence appears to be associated with functions unique to more complex tissues (krupa2002therepertoireof pages 2-3, huynh2025insilicoidentification pages 6-10). Additionally, analyses based on hierarchical clustering using position-specific scoring matrices affirm its grouping within the kinase family that shares a common evolutionary history with other serine/threonine kinases, reflecting the conservation of the catalytic core and the modulatory influence of extra-kinase domains, such as the ankyrin repeats that are characteristic of RIPK4 (johnson2023anatlasof pages 4-5, krupa2002therepertoireof pages 13-14).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nRIPK4 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues in substrate proteins. The chemical reaction can be summarized as follows:  \nATP + [protein]-(L‑serine or L‑threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L‑serine/threonine‑phosphate) + H⁺ (huynh2025insilicoidentification pages 10-13, johnson2023anatlasof pages 5-5).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe enzymatic activity of RIPK4, like that of many serine/threonine kinases, requires the presence of divalent metal ion cofactors such as Mg²⁺. These ions are essential for stabilizing the structure of ATP and facilitating its proper orientation in the active site of the kinase (huynh2025insilicoidentification pages 10-13, johnson2023anatlasof pages 5-5).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nHigh-throughput profiling of the human serine/threonine kinome has placed RIPK4 within the RIPK/WNK cluster, indicating that it shares substrate motif preferences with kinases in this group (johnson2023anatlasof pages 2-3, johnson2023anatlasof pages 4-5). Although the detailed consensus motif for RIPK4 has not been explicitly delineated in the available excerpts, the atlas of substrate specificities reveals that kinases in this cluster generally discriminate substrates based on specific arrangements of charged and aromatic residues surrounding the phosphorylation site (johnson2023anatlasof pages 7-8). This implies that RIPK4 is likely to recognize substrate sequences where basic residues flank the central phosphorylatable serine/threonine, potentially with a dominant selection for aromatic residues at defined positions (johnson2023anatlasof pages 12-18). The experimental approach based on peptide array screening and computational analysis provides a resource to infer its substrate preferences and offers a framework for identifying candidate substrates via motif–matching in phosphoproteomic studies (johnson2023anatlasof pages 9-10).\n\n5. Structure  \nRIPK4 displays a prototypical kinase architecture composed of an N-terminal catalytic kinase domain and a C-terminal region enriched with ankyrin repeat motifs, which are critical for mediating protein–protein interactions. The kinase domain likely adopts a bilobal fold with an N-terminal lobe consisting primarily of beta sheets and a predominantly alpha-helical C-terminal lobe that together form the ATP-binding cleft (krupa2002therepertoireof pages 2-3, johnson2023anatlasof pages 4-4). Within the catalytic domain, key structural features, such as the activation loop, the conserved DFG motif, the hydrophobic spine, and the C-helix, are expected to be present and essential for catalytic activity. The ankyrin repeats in the C-terminal region serve as modular protein–interaction motifs that potentially modulate substrate recruitment or regulate intramolecular interactions (ctrlUnknownyearsupplementaltable1kinextm pages 1-1, thiriet2013cytoplasmicproteinserinethreonine pages 113-116). Structural models, including those predicted by AlphaFold, support the arrangement of these domains with the catalytic core adopting a conserved conformation typical of serine/threonine kinases, while the ankyrin repeat region appears as tandem helical motifs that extend the interaction interface (krupa2002therepertoireof pages 3-4, huynh2025insilicoidentification pages 10-13).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of RIPK4 is mediated by both post-translational modifications and protein–protein interactions. Phosphorylation events within RIPK4 can serve as key regulatory switches that modulate its kinase activity, with auto-phosphorylation likely playing a role in enzyme activation. In addition, interaction with protein kinase C isoforms, particularly PKCδ, has been documented as a regulatory mechanism that influences RIPK4 function (thiriet2013cytoplasmicproteinserinethreonine pages 38-41). Transcriptional regulation also contributes to its activity; RIPK4 is a direct transcriptional target of TP63, linking its expression to developmental and differentiation pathways in epithelial tissues (huynh2025insilicoidentification pages 6-10). Furthermore, RIPK4 has been implicated in the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, a process that involves complex regulation through phosphorylation cascades and the formation of signaling complexes (huynh2025insilicoidentification pages 17-18, huynh2025insilicoidentification pages 16-17).\n\n7. Function  \nRIPK4 is required for proper embryonic skin development and the maintenance of skin homeostasis in adults. By phosphorylating substrates such as plakophilin 1 (PKP1), RIPK4 promotes keratinocyte differentiation and cell adhesion, thereby contributing to the structural integrity and barrier function of the skin (huynh2025insilicoidentification pages 10-13, huynh2025insilicoidentification pages 6-10). In addition to its roles in skin biology, RIPK4 participates in key signaling pathways, including the regulation of NF-κB activation, which influences inflammatory responses and cell survival (huynh2025insilicoidentification pages 17-18). Its expression is observed in epithelial tissues and is tightly linked to developmental processes, with dysregulation associated with pathological conditions such as cancer, as evidenced by its correlation with poor overall survival in pancreatic adenocarcinoma when co-expressed with ANKRD22 (huynh2025insilicoidentification pages 16-17, huynh2025insilicoidentification pages 20-20).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nAmong the pharmacological agents, fostamatinib—a drug originally developed as a SYK inhibitor—has been identified in in silico screening studies to interact with RIPK4, suggesting potential repurposing opportunities for targeting RIPK4 in clinical contexts, particularly in cancer where its overexpression correlates with aggressive disease (huynh2025insilicoidentification pages 10-13, huynh2025insilicoidentification pages 16-17). Although specific direct inhibitors of RIPK4 have not been extensively characterized, its involvement in oncogenic signaling pathways such as RAF1/MEK/ERK and NF-κB further supports its candidature as a therapeutic target. Additionally, its role as a direct transcriptional target of TP63 places RIPK4 at a critical nexus of developmental and oncogenic signaling. The enzyme’s domain architecture, combining a conserved catalytic domain with ankyrin repeats, represents a potential foundation for the development of inhibitors that may selectively target its protein–protein interaction surfaces as well as its kinase activity (trzcinskadaneluti2015rnainterferencescreen pages 4-5, santos2016oncogenicgrproverexpression pages 77-77).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nJAK1 is a member of the Janus kinase family, a conserved group of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases that are found in all vertebrates and have orthologs across many metazoan species (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 14-15). Within the human kinome, JAK1 is grouped with JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2 and shares the common domain architecture of an N‐terminal FERM domain, an SH2-like domain, a central pseudokinase (JH2) domain and a C‐terminal kinase (JH1) domain (kwon2022moleculardissectionof pages 1-2, li2017insightsontype pages 14-20). Evolutionarily, JAK1 and its family members are thought to have arisen from a common ancestral kinase and are part of a core set of signaling proteins essential for cytokine responses—a lineage that can be traced back to the last common ancestor of eukaryotes (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 14-15, raivolaUnknownyearmolecularregulationof pages 23-27).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nJAK1 catalyzes the phosphorylation reaction that transfers a phosphate group from ATP to tyrosine residues on substrate proteins. The chemical reaction can be represented as:  \n  ATP + [protein]–Tyr → ADP + [protein]–Tyr‐phosphate + H⁺  \nIn cytokine receptor signaling, JAK1 phosphorylates specific tyrosine residues on receptor intracellular domains as well as on STAT transcription factors, thereby initiating downstream signal transduction (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 1-3, babon2014themolecularregulation pages 11-13).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of JAK1 is strictly dependent on ATP as a phosphate donor, and divalent metal ions, typically Mg²⁺, are required as cofactors to coordinate ATP binding and facilitate effective phosphotransfer (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 4-6, castelosoccio2023proteinkinasesdrug pages 5-7).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nJAK1, as a tyrosine kinase, exhibits a substrate specificity that is defined by its intrinsic catalytic properties. It phosphorylates tyrosine residues on specific substrates, which include the intracellular domains of cytokine receptors and STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) proteins. Recent studies on the intrinsic substrate specificities of the human tyrosine kinome show that while a consensus motif may not be as sharply defined as that for serine/threonine kinases, tyrosine kinases demonstrate a preference for certain surrounding amino acid contexts that facilitate recognition and efficient phosphorylation (Yaron-Barir2024, Johnson2023 provide complementary data for kinase families but for JAK1 the intrinsic substrate specificity is mostly derived from its role in phosphorylating receptor-associated tyrosine sites that later serve as docking platforms for STAT proteins) (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 9-11, castelosoccio2023proteinkinasesdrug pages 7-8).\n\n5. Structure  \nJAK1 exhibits a modular domain organization characteristic of Janus kinases. Starting at the N-terminus, it contains a FERM (four-point-one, ezrin, radixin, moesin) domain that mediates interactions with cytokine receptor motifs and plays a role in proper subcellular targeting (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 1-3, raivolaUnknownyearmolecularregulationof pages 27-29). Following the FERM domain is an SH2-like domain which, although it does not function in classical phosphotyrosine recognition, contributes structurally to receptor binding by stabilizing the association with receptor intracellular segments (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 6-7). Centrally located is the pseudokinase domain (JH2), an evolutionarily conserved module that, despite lacking full catalytic competence due to missing key catalytic residues, plays a critical regulatory role by maintaining the kinase domain (JH1) in an autoinhibited state in the absence of cytokine stimulation (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 4-6, li2017insightsontype pages 26-30). The C-terminal JH1 domain is the catalytically active tyrosine kinase region and displays a bilobed structure typical of protein kinases with an N-terminal lobe containing a glycine-rich loop (P-loop) for phosphate binding and a C-terminal lobe that includes critical features such as the activation loop (A-loop) and the conserved catalytic lysine residue required for ATP binding (kwon2022moleculardissectionof pages 4-6, babon2014themolecularregulation pages 7-9). Additional structural elements such as the hydrophobic spine and the C-helix within the kinase domain are crucial for catalytic regulation and conformational changes upon activation (niranjan2014functionalcharacterizationof pages 38-41, raivolaUnknownyearmolecularregulationof pages 44-48). Together, these domains coordinate receptor binding, autoinhibition, and activation through conformational rearrangements induced by cytokine receptor dimerization (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 26-28, raivolaUnknownyearmolecularregulationof pages 30-33).\n\n6. Regulation  \nJAK1 activity is regulated by multiple mechanisms that include both intrinsic autoinhibition and extrinsic modulation by interacting proteins. The pseudokinase domain (JH2) plays a central role by maintaining the kinase (JH1) in an autoinhibited conformation under basal conditions; receptor-mediated conformational changes relieve this autoinhibition to allow trans-phosphorylation and activation of the kinase domains (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 4-6, raivolaUnknownyearmolecularregulationof pages 143-152). Activation of JAK1 involves phosphorylation at critical tyrosine residues in the activation loop (di-tyrosine motif), which is essential for its catalytic activity and subsequent STAT phosphorylation (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 11-13, raivolaUnknownyearmolecularregulationof pages 161-163). In addition, negative regulatory proteins such as members of the suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family bind to the receptor-JAK complex and inhibit JAK1 kinase activity, while protein tyrosine phosphatases (for instance, SHP1 and SHP2) dephosphorylate activated JAK1, thereby attenuating downstream signaling (braidotti2023terapiadiprecisione pages 81-83, raivolaUnknownyearmolecularregulationof pages 37-40). Mutations within the pseudokinase domain, such as those analogous to the V617F mutation in JAK2 (V658F in JAK1), disrupt the autoinhibitory interactions and result in constitutive activation, which has been associated with several hematological malignancies (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 4-6, raivolaUnknownyearmolecularregulationof pages 152-154).\n\n7. Function  \nJAK1 is a critical mediator of cytokine receptor signaling pathways and is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues. It plays an essential role in transducing signals from a variety of cytokines, including type I and type II interferons (IFN-α, IFN-β, and IFN-γ), interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptors, and interleukin-10 (IL-10) receptors (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 1-3, babon2014themolecularregulation pages 11-13). Upon cytokine binding to their cognate receptors, JAK1 becomes activated through receptor dimerization, leading to trans-phosphorylation events that create docking sites for STAT proteins. Phosphorylated STATs subsequently form homodimers or heterodimers, translocate to the nucleus, and regulate gene transcription involved in immune response, cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (castelosoccio2023proteinkinasesdrug pages 5-7, braidotti2023terapiadiprecisione pages 13-15). Furthermore, JAK1 can act as a kinase partner to modulate signaling by transactivating other JAK family members associated with receptor complexes, thereby enhancing the fidelity and strength of the cytokine response (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 1-3, malemud2018theroleof pages 1-2). In addition, constitutive or aberrant activation of JAK1, as observed in gain-of-function somatic mutations, is implicated in the pathogenesis of hematological malignancies such as T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and other immune-mediated disorders (raivolaUnknownyearmolecularregulationof pages 154-156, raivolaUnknownyearmolecularregulationof pages 161-163).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nMultiple small-molecule inhibitors have been developed to target the ATP-binding site of JAK1, either alone or in combination with other JAK family members. Examples of these clinical compounds include ruxolitinib, tofacitinib, baricitinib, and more recent selective inhibitors such as filgotinib and abrocitinib (castelosoccio2023proteinkinasesdrug pages 7-8, zarrin2021kinaseinhibitionin pages 5-6). Inhibitor development faces challenges due to the high conservation of the ATP-binding pocket across kinases; therefore, alternative approaches targeting regulatory domains, such as the pseudokinase domain, are being explored for improved specificity (raivolaUnknownyearmolecularregulationof pages 154-156, kwon2022moleculardissectionof pages 6-8). Disease associations of JAK1 extend beyond hematological malignancies to include autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, as well as immune deficiencies resulting from loss-of-function mutations. Furthermore, JAK1’s role in interferon receptor signaling implicates it in antiviral immunity and immune surveillance (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 3-4, braidotti2023terapiadiprecisione pages 81-83).\n\n9.

Mediates essential signaling events in both innate and adaptive immunity. In the cytoplasm, plays a pivotal role in signal transduction via its association with type I receptors such as growth hormone (GHR), prolactin (PRLR), leptin (LEPR), erythropoietin (EPOR), thrombopoietin receptor (MPL/TPOR); or type II receptors including IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, IFN-gamma and multiple interleukins (PubMed:15690087, PubMed:7615558, PubMed:9657743, PubMed:15899890). Following ligand-binding to cell surface receptors, phosphorylates specific tyrosine residues on the cytoplasmic tails of the receptor, creating docking sites for STATs proteins (PubMed:15690087, PubMed:9618263). Subsequently, phosphorylates the STATs proteins once they are recruited to the receptor. Phosphorylated STATs then form homodimer or heterodimers and translocate to the nucleus to activate gene transcription. For example, cell stimulation with erythropoietin (EPO) during erythropoiesis leads to JAK2 autophosphorylation, activation, and its association with erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) that becomes phosphorylated in its cytoplasmic domain (PubMed:9657743). Then, STAT5 (STAT5A or STAT5B) is recruited, phosphorylated and activated by JAK2. Once activated, dimerized STAT5 translocates into the nucleus and promotes the transcription of several essential genes involved in the modulation of erythropoiesis. Part of a signaling cascade that is activated by increased cellular retinol and that leads to the activation of STAT5 (STAT5A or STAT5B) (PubMed:21368206). In addition, JAK2 mediates angiotensin-2-induced ARHGEF1 phosphorylation (PubMed:20098430). Plays a role in cell cycle by phosphorylating CDKN1B (PubMed:21423214). Cooperates with TEC through reciprocal phosphorylation to mediate cytokine-driven activation of FOS transcription. In the nucleus, plays a key role in chromatin by specifically mediating phosphorylation of 'Tyr-41' of histone H3 (H3Y41ph), a specific tag that promotes exclusion of CBX5 (HP1 alpha) from chromatin (PubMed:19783980). Up-regulates the potassium voltage-gated channel activity of KCNA3 (PubMed:25644777)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine-protein kinase JAK2, commonly referred to as Janus kinase 2, is a member of the Janus kinase (JAK) family that also includes JAK1, JAK3, and tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2), and is evolutionarily conserved among metazoans. Comparative sequence analyses have demonstrated that the JAK family kinase domains and associated regulatory modules are present in organisms ranging from invertebrates to mammals, indicating an early metazoan origin with conservation of the characteristic domain architecture. JAK2 and its orthologs are found in all mammalian species, reflecting their essential roles in cytokine signaling pathways that regulate hematopoiesis, immune responses, and other fundamental cellular processes (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 1-3, krupa2002therepertoireof pages 5-7). In phylogenetic analyses, JAK2 groups with other non-receptor tyrosine kinases that feature a bipartite catalytic region flanked by regulatory domains. This evolutionary grouping underscores not only its conserved kinase catalytic core but also its unique pairing of a catalytically active kinase domain (JH1) and an adjacent pseudokinase domain (JH2) that evolved to confer autoinhibitory regulation (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 3-4, wilks2008thejakkinases pages 1-1). The conservation of these domains and their sequence motifs across species supports the classification of JAK2 as part of an ancient and indispensable signaling mechanism present in the common ancestor of chordates (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 1-3, krupa2002therepertoireof pages 5-7).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nJAK2 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to specific tyrosine residues on protein substrates. The chemical reaction can be represented as:  \n  ATP + protein – Tyr → ADP + protein – phosphotyrosine + H⁺  \nThis reaction is central to the propagation of intracellular signals after cytokine receptor activation and is typical of tyrosine kinases. In this reaction, JAK2 utilizes ATP as a phosphate donor, converting it to ADP while phosphorylating tyrosine residues on receptor tails or on downstream signaling molecules such as STAT transcription factors (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 1-3, hubbard2018mechanisticinsightsinto pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of JAK2, like that of most protein kinases, is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ion cofactors, with Mg²⁺ being essential for the efficient binding and proper orientation of ATP within the active site. Mg²⁺ coordinates with the phosphate groups of ATP and stabilizes the transition state during the phosphoryl transfer reaction. This requirement for Mg²⁺ is consistent with the general attributes of tyrosine kinases and has been demonstrated by biochemical studies involving kinase assays (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 1-3, wilks2008thejakkinases pages 5-6).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nJAK2 exhibits substrate specificity that is essential for its role in cytokine signaling. It primarily phosphorylates tyrosine residues located within the cytoplasmic domains of cytokine receptors and within downstream signaling proteins such as the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). Detailed analyses of tyrosine kinase substrate specificity have revealed that JAK2, like other members of the human tyrosine kinome, recognizes specific amino acid motifs surrounding the target tyrosine. Studies employing positional scanning peptide arrays and combinatorial peptide libraries have contributed to the characterization of the intrinsic substrate specificity of tyrosine kinases. For JAK kinases, the substrate motif typically spans from five residues upstream to several residues downstream of the phosphorylated tyrosine and includes preferences for particular amino acids at defined positions. For instance, the work by Yaron-Barir et al. (2024) has shown that the intrinsic substrate specificity of tyrosine kinases exhibits sequence-dependent patterns that facilitate the recognition of suitable substrates. Although the precise consensus motif for JAK2 may vary depending on the receptor context, common features include the requirement for a hydrophobic or basic residue at positions adjacent to the tyrosine residue (yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 1-2, yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 16-16). In cellular contexts, the docking sites formed by phosphorylated cytokine receptor tails serve as platforms that recruit STAT proteins via their SH2 domains, and subsequent phosphorylation by JAK2 further refines the substrate specificity dictated by the local peptide environment (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 7-9, yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 19-22).\n\n5. Structure  \nJAK2 is characterized by a modular architecture comprising several distinct domains that confer its catalytic activity, regulatory functions, and capacity for interactions with cytokine receptors. The protein contains an N-terminal FERM (band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin) domain followed by an SH2-like domain, a pseudokinase domain (often referred to as JH2), and a C-terminal tyrosine kinase domain (JH1).  \n • The FERM domain mediates the association of JAK2 with the cytoplasmic tails of type I and II cytokine receptors and is critical for proper subcellular localization and signal initiation (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 1-3, babon2014themolecularregulation pages 3-4).  \n • The SH2-like domain, although not always functionally equivalent to classical SH2 domains in terms of phosphotyrosine binding, contributes to the structural integrity and proper positioning of adjacent domains (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 4-6, wilks2008thejakkinases pages 4-5).  \n • The pseudokinase domain (JH2) is a hallmark of JAK kinases and serves as a regulatory module that autoregulates kinase activity by inhibiting the adjacent catalytic domain in the absence of receptor stimulation. Notably, mutations in the pseudokinase domain, such as the V617F mutation, disrupt this autoinhibition and lead to constitutive activation of JAK2 activity, which is implicated in several myeloproliferative disorders (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 6-7, hubbard2018mechanisticinsightsinto pages 6-7).  \n • The C-terminal kinase domain (JH1) is the catalytically active region responsible for the phosphorylation of substrate tyrosine residues. Structural studies, including crystallography and molecular modeling, have elucidated features such as the activation loop containing key regulatory tyrosines, a hydrophobic spine, and a critical C-helix that coordinates proper catalytic conformation (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 4-6, wilks2008thejakkinases pages 4-5).  \nIn addition, JAK2 exhibits unique structural features such as an insertion loop not commonly found in other tyrosine kinases and specific interdomain interfaces that mediate autoinhibition and activation. These structural hallmarks have been further delineated by X-ray crystallographic analyses and AlphaFold models, contributing to our understanding of how conformational changes upon receptor dimerization enable trans-phosphorylation and full kinase activation (wilks2008thejakkinases pages 5-6, babon2014themolecularregulation pages 26-28).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of JAK2 activity is multifaceted and includes several layers of control mediated by post-translational modifications, domain-domain interactions, and adaptor proteins. Autophosphorylation events are central to JAK2 activation; for example, phosphorylation of tyrosines in the activation loop of the kinase domain (such as Y1007 and Y1008) is essential for enhancing catalytic activity (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 9-11, hubbard2018mechanisticinsightsinto pages 1-2). The pseudokinase domain (JH2), despite being catalytically weak, can autophosphorylate inhibitory residues such as Ser523 and Tyr570, thereby providing a negative feedback mechanism and modulating the overall kinase activity (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 6-7, hammaren2016nucleotidebindingmechanismsin pages 6-8).  \nIn addition, JAK2 is subject to regulation by other post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination and SUMOylation. Ubiquitination of JAK2 has been shown to be linked to its phosphorylation state and is involved in proper turnover and signaling attenuation (ungureanu2005posttranslationalmodificationsin pages 11-14, ungureanu2005posttranslationalmodificationsin pages 16-18). Specific E3 ubiquitin ligases have been implicated in targeting activated JAK2 for proteasomal degradation, although the particular ligases have not been exhaustively defined in these reports. SUMOylation events may also influence the subcellular distribution of JAK2, including its nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling (ungureanu2005posttranslationalmodificationsin pages 38-40, ungureanu2005posttranslationalmodificationsin pages 40-42).  \nRegulatory interactions with adaptor proteins further modulate JAK2 activity. For example, the adaptor protein Lnk binds to a specific phosphotyrosine within a linker region of JAK2, thereby negatively regulating cytokine signaling and modulating hematopoiesis (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 13-14, babon2014themolecularregulation pages 22-23). Moreover, phosphatases such as SHP1, SHP2, and PTP1B are involved in dephosphorylating activated tyrosine residues on JAK2, contributing to signal termination and maintenance of controlled cellular responses (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 15-17, ungureanu2005posttranslationalmodificationsin pages 63-65). Collectively, these regulatory mechanisms ensure that JAK2 activity is tightly controlled, permitting rapid activation in response to cytokine binding while preventing aberrant signaling that could lead to pathological outcomes (hubard2018mechanisticinsightsinto pages 2-3, babon2014themolecularregulation pages 17-18).\n\n7. Function  \nJAK2 functions as a central non-receptor tyrosine kinase in nearly all cells expressing cytokine receptors. In the cytoplasm, it is recruited to type I and type II cytokine receptors, where it becomes activated following ligand-induced receptor dimerization. Once activated, JAK2 phosphorylates tyrosine residues on the receptor’s intracellular domains, thereby creating docking sites for STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) proteins (alexander2015theconciseguide pages 10-13, babon2014themolecularregulation pages 1-3). Following recruitment, STAT proteins are phosphorylated by JAK2, undergo dimerization, and translocate to the nucleus where they modulate the transcription of genes essential for processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and survival (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 13-14, hubbard2018mechanisticinsightsinto pages 1-2).  \nIn addition, JAK2 plays a pivotal role in hematopoiesis. For instance, erythropoietin binding to its receptor (EPOR) leads to JAK2 activation, which in turn phosphorylates STAT5, driving the transcription of genes required for erythroid cell proliferation and differentiation (alexander2015theconciseguide pages 10-13, babon2014themolecularregulation pages 28-29). Beyond hematopoiesis, JAK2 is involved in the signaling cascades initiated by receptors for growth hormone (GHR), prolactin (PRLR), leptin (LEPR), thrombopoietin (MPL/TPOR), interferons (IFN‑α, IFN‑β, IFN‑γ), and various interleukins. These signaling events are critical for both innate and adaptive immune responses (alexander2015theconciseguide pages 10-13, babon2014themolecularregulation pages 22-23).  \nFurthermore, nuclear functions of JAK2 have been reported; once translocated into the nucleus, JAK2 phosphorylates histone H3 at tyrosine 41 (H3Y41), which results in the displacement of chromatin-associated proteins such as CBX5 (HP1 alpha) and thereby facilitates gene transcription (alexander2015theconciseguide pages 10-13). JAK2 also participates in cell cycle regulation by phosphorylating cell cycle regulators, including CDKN1B, and cooperates with other kinases such as TEC to mediate transcriptional activation of genes like FOS (alexander2015theconciseguide pages 10-13, babon2014themolecularregulation pages 17-18). These multiple biological roles underscore the multifunctional nature of JAK2 in modulating diverse cellular processes through its activity in the cytoplasm and nucleus (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 13-14, hubbard2018mechanisticinsightsinto pages 1-2).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nNumerous small-molecule inhibitors have been developed targeting JAK2 owing to its critical involvement in cytokine signaling and its association with various diseases, most notably myeloproliferative neoplasms and certain leukemias. Specific inhibitors listed in the literature include agents such as NS-018, BMS-911543, AT-9283, XL019, fedratinib, and gandotinib, all designed to inhibit aberrant JAK2 activity (alexander2015theconciseguide pages 10-13, wilks2008thejakkinases pages 8-9). Ruxolitinib, although initially characterized as a JAK1-selective inhibitor, also exhibits clinical efficacy against JAK2-driven pathologies. The commonly observed JAK2V617F mutation, which leads to constitutive kinase activation, is frequently targeted by these therapeutic agents, and its presence is strongly correlated with myeloproliferative disorders such as polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 6-7, wilks2008thejakkinases pages 9-10).  \nIn addition to direct kinase inhibition, efforts to modulate JAK2 activity also include strategies aimed at interfering with its protein–protein interactions, such as those between the FERM domain and the receptor, or by stabilizing the autoinhibitory interaction between the pseudokinase (JH2) and kinase (JH1) domains. Disease associations extend beyond hematologic malignancies to include roles in immune dysregulation and possibly in signaling cascades involved in metabolic regulation. The extensive efforts to develop selective JAK2 inhibitors are supported by detailed structural studies and substrate specificity analyses, including recent contributions that outline the intrinsic substrate specificity of the tyrosine kinome (yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 1-2, babon2014themolecularregulation pages 22-23).  \nFinally, JAK2 stands as a prominent target in drug discovery pipelines, and resources such as the Chemical Probes portal, the MRC Kinase Inhibitor Database, and others are routinely consulted to assess inhibitor specificity and efficacy against this kinase (leoni2014novelthiazolederivatives pages 6-7, bansal2023smallmoleculeinhibitorsof pages 2-3).\n\n9.

Mediates essential signaling events in both innate and adaptive immunity and plays a crucial role in hematopoiesis during T-cells development. In the cytoplasm, plays a pivotal role in signal transduction via its association with type I receptors sharing the common subunit gamma such as IL2R, IL4R, IL7R, IL9R, IL15R and IL21R. Following ligand binding to cell surface receptors, phosphorylates specific tyrosine residues on the cytoplasmic tails of the receptor, creating docking sites for STATs proteins. Subsequently, phosphorylates the STATs proteins once they are recruited to the receptor. Phosphorylated STATs then form homodimer or heterodimers and translocate to the nucleus to activate gene transcription. For example, upon IL2R activation by IL2, JAK1 and JAK3 molecules bind to IL2R beta (IL2RB) and gamma chain (IL2RG) subunits inducing the tyrosine phosphorylation of both receptor subunits on their cytoplasmic domain. Then, STAT5A and STAT5B are recruited, phosphorylated and activated by JAK1 and JAK3. Once activated, dimerized STAT5 translocates to the nucleus and promotes the transcription of specific target genes in a cytokine-specific fashion**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny:  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase JAK3 belongs to the Janus kinase family, a group of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases that includes JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2. JAK3 is evolutionarily conserved among vertebrates and its gene emerged following gene duplication events that expanded the JAK family from a common ancestral kinase that existed prior to the divergence of invertebrates and vertebrates (yamaoka2004thejanuskinases pages 1-2). In contrast to JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2, which are expressed ubiquitously, JAK3 shows a highly restricted expression profile limited primarily to hematopoietic cells, reflecting its evolution toward a specialized role in immune cell signaling (oshea2009januskinasesin pages 1-2). Phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that the domain architecture (comprising an N-terminal FERM domain, SH2-like module, a pseudokinase (JH2) domain, and a catalytic kinase (JH1) domain) is conserved among JAK family members, although divergence in regulatory elements and expression patterns differentiates JAK3 from its paralogs (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 1-3).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed:  \nJAK3 catalyzes a phosphorylation reaction in which ATP donates a phosphate group to specific tyrosine residues on protein substrates, which include the cytoplasmic receptors and downstream signaling proteins such as STAT transcription factors. In chemical terms, the reaction can be summarized as follows: ATP + [protein]-tyrosine → ADP + [protein]-phosphotyrosine + H⁺ (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 3-4).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements:  \nThe catalytic activity of JAK3 depends on the presence of divalent metal cations, and biochemical assays indicate that Mg²⁺ is required as a cofactor to facilitate the ATP-dependent phosphorylation reaction (wu2012januskinase3 pages 2-4).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity:  \nJAK3 preferentially phosphorylates tyrosine residues found in the cytoplasmic domains of cytokine receptors as well as on STAT proteins once they are recruited to these receptor complexes. The specificity of JAK3 is largely dictated by its association with receptors containing the common gamma (γc) chain, thereby catalyzing tyrosine phosphorylation events that facilitate further recruitment and activation of STAT5, among other family members (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 14-15). In addition, recent systematic studies of the human tyrosine kinome have characterized substrate motifs for tyrosine kinases and provide consensus sequence data for tyrosine phosphorylation events, for example showing a preference for motifs that contain specific surrounding amino acid residues such as hydrophobic or basic residues near the target tyrosine (Yaron-Barir2024 pages 1174-1181). Parallel studies in the serine/threonine kinase field indicate that the inherent specificity of kinases is largely determined by the arrangement of neighboring residues, and by analogy, JAK3’s substrate recognition depends on steric and electrostatic complementarity with its substrates (Johnson2023 pages 759-766).\n\n5. Structure:  \nJAK3 is organized into an array of functional domains that coordinate its role in signal transduction. The N-terminal region harbors a FERM domain that is critical for mediating interactions with the intracellular regions of cytokine receptors such as the IL2R, IL7R, and others sharing the γc subunit (yamaoka2004thejanuskinases pages 2-3). Adjacent to the FERM domain, an SH2-like domain contributes to receptor binding and possibly stabilization of the receptor–kinase complex (oshea2009januskinasesin pages 2-4). Central to the protein is the pseudokinase (JH2) domain, which, although catalytically inactive, functions in autoinhibitory regulation and conformational stabilization of the active kinase domain (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 4-6, lupardus2014structureofthe pages 6-6). At the C-terminus, the kinase (JH1) domain is responsible for the catalytic activity of JAK3 and includes features such as the activation loop, a C-helix that participates in the formation of the hydrophobic spine, and the ATP-binding pocket that harbors a unique cysteine residue (Cys909) exploited for covalent inhibitor binding (forster2017recentadvancesin pages 12-16, wu2012januskinase3 pages 5-6). Structural analyses, including crystallography and molecular modeling, reveal that the catalytic domain maintains a bi-lobal architecture common to kinases with key catalytic residues properly aligned to facilitate phosphotransfer (vihinen2000molecularmodelingof pages 5-7). These features, including the N-terminal regulatory domains and the arrangement of the activation loop with regulatory phosphorylatable tyrosine residues, are critical for the proper regulation of JAK3 activity (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 3-4).\n\n6. Regulation:  \nRegulation of JAK3 activity occurs by multiple mechanisms, including post-translational modifications and conformational changes induced by receptor engagement. Autophosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues within the kinase domain, notably in the activation loop, is required for full catalytic activation; for instance, phosphorylation events at positions analogous to Y980 and Y981 in related JAK kinases modulate activity, although detailed mapping in JAK3 continues to emerge (oshea2009januskinasesin pages 6-8). In addition, the pseudokinase domain exerts an autoinhibitory effect under basal conditions by stabilizing the kinase in an inactive conformation (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 4-6). Negative regulatory proteins, such as members of the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family and other phosphatases, interact with JAK3 to downregulate its signaling output by promoting dephosphorylation and proteasomal degradation (ungureanu2005posttranslationalmodificationsin pages 11-14). Furthermore, reversible interactions between the FERM and SH2 domains have been reported to modulate substrate access and kinase activation, while covalent modifications via specific inhibitors targeting reactive residues (e.g., covalent binding to Cys909) have provided additional insights into regulatory mechanisms (forster2017recentadvancesin pages 16-18, elwood2017evaluationofjak3 pages 22-24).\n\n7. Function:  \nJAK3 is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that plays an indispensable role in mediating cytokine receptor signaling in hematopoietic cells. Its primary function involves association with cytokine receptors that share a common gamma (γc) chain, including receptors for interleukins IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21, which are essential for lymphocyte development, proliferation, and survival (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 14-15, oshea2009januskinasesin pages 6-8). Upon ligand binding to these receptors, JAK3 becomes activated by trans-phosphorylation in coordination with JAK1, and subsequently phosphorylates tyrosine residues on the receptor cytoplasmic tails; these phosphorylated sites serve as docking sites for STAT transcription factors (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 13-14, oshea2009januskinasesin pages 20-23). The phosphorylation of STATs, particularly STAT5, allows their dimerization and nuclear translocation where they regulate gene transcription pertinent to immune responses and hematopoiesis (elwood2017evaluationofjak3 pages 5-7). JAK3’s restricted expression to hematopoietic and immune cells underlies its essential role in T-cell development and function, and mutations in JAK3 result in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) characterized by impaired T and NK cell maturation (oshea2009januskinasesin pages 6-8, rane2000januskinasescomponents pages 13-14). This central role in immune signaling has motivated the development of selective inhibitors, which aim to modulate aberrant JAK3 activity in autoimmune disorders and some hematologic malignancies (elwood2017evaluationofjak3 pages 22-24, forster2017recentadvancesin pages 18-20).\n\n8. Other Comments:  \nSeveral small molecule inhibitors targeting JAK3 have been developed with an emphasis on achieving high selectivity over other JAK family members. Notably, covalent inhibitors that specifically modify the unique Cys909 residue in the JAK3 kinase domain have demonstrated both potent and selective inhibition in biochemical and cellular assays (forster2017recentadvancesin pages 20-23, elwood2017evaluationofjak3 pages 29-30). These inhibitors are under clinical evaluation for the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, given their potential to suppress pathological cytokine signaling while sparing JAK-mediated hematopoiesis (elwood2017evaluationofjak3 pages 22-24, dymock2013inhibitorsofjak2 pages 35-36). In addition to pharmacological modulation, genetic mutations – both loss-of-function mutations, which lead to SCID, and activating mutations found in leukemias – underscore the critical role of JAK3 in maintaining immune homeostasis (rane2000januskinasescomponents pages 1-2, walters2006activatingallelesof pages 1-2). Ongoing research into the substrate specificity and regulatory mechanisms of JAK3, integrating findings from studies on the intrinsic specificity of the human tyrosine kinome (Yaron-Barir2024) and comparative kinase specificity profiling (Johnson2023), continues to refine our understanding of its role in cellular signaling and therapeutic targeting.\n\n9.

Associates with heterodimeric cytokine receptor complexes and activates STAT family members including STAT1, STAT3, STAT4 or STAT6 (PubMed:10542297, PubMed:7638186). The heterodimeric cytokine receptor complexes are composed of (1) a TYK2-associated receptor chain (IFNAR1, IL12RB1, IL10RB or IL13RA1), and (2) a second receptor chain associated either with JAK1 or JAK2 (PubMed:10542297, PubMed:25762719, PubMed:7526154, PubMed:7813427). In response to cytokine-binding to receptors, phosphorylates and activates receptors (IFNAR1, IL12RB1, IL10RB or IL13RA1), creating docking sites for STAT members (PubMed:7526154, PubMed:7657660). In turn, recruited STATs are phosphorylated by TYK2 (or JAK1/JAK2 on the second receptor chain), form homo- and heterodimers, translocate to the nucleus, and regulate cytokine/growth factor responsive genes (PubMed:10542297, PubMed:25762719, PubMed:7657660).

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny:**  \nNon‐receptor tyrosine‐protein kinase TYK2 belongs to the Janus kinase (JAK) family, a group of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases that mediate cytokine receptor signaling. TYK2 is evolutionarily related to other JAK family members such as JAK1, JAK2, and JAK3, and its orthologs have been identified across a broad spectrum of mammalian species, indicating its conservation among vertebrates (wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 1-5, korcz1995tyrosineproteinkinase pages 6-7). The phylogenetic analyses performed by Manning et al. (2002) established that the JAK family arose early in metazoan evolution through gene duplication events, and TYK2 represents one branch that has retained unique structural and functional features compared with receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and other non‐receptor tyrosine kinases (wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 1-5, loris2007exploringstructureand pages 27-28). Within the human kinome, TYK2 falls into the tyrosine kinase (TK) group and specifically within the non‐receptor class, setting it apart from the approximately 20 receptor tyrosine kinases that signal through extracellular ligand engagement (korcz1995tyrosineproteinkinase pages 4-6, loris2007exploringstructureand pages 43-46). Its close evolutionary relationship with other cytokine‐associated kinases suggests that TYK2 and its paralogs share a common ancestral gene that was already present in early eukaryotic ancestors, thereby forming part of the conserved JAK–STAT signaling machinery (wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 1-5, loris2007exploringstructureand pages 16-21).\n\n**2. Reaction Catalyzed:**  \nTYK2 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to specific tyrosine residues on substrate proteins. In the canonical reaction, one molecule of ATP and a protein substrate containing a tyrosine residue are converted into ADP and a phosphorylated tyrosine residue on the protein, with the concomitant release of a proton (H^+). This phosphorylation reaction is central to its role in mediating cytokine receptor signaling as it creates docking sites for downstream signaling molecules, notably members of the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) family (wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 1-5, reys2022insilicoprofiling pages 29-32). The reaction thus can be summarized as:  \nATP + [protein]–Tyr → ADP + [protein]–Tyr‑phosphate + H^+ (wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 1-5, loris2007exploringstructureand pages 43-46).  \nThis catalytic activity is essential for the initiation of multiple signaling cascades following cytokine binding to receptor complexes, leading to subsequent gene transcription events (wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 14-17).\n\n**3. Cofactor Requirements:**  \nThe catalytic activity of TYK2 is dependent on the binding of ATP and the presence of divalent metal ions, most commonly magnesium (Mg^2+), which serve as essential cofactors. Mg^2+ ions coordinate with the phosphate groups of ATP within the active site and stabilize the transition state during the phosphoryl transfer reaction (wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 5-8, reys2022insilicoprofiling pages 29-32). The requirement for Mg^2+ is shared among protein kinases and is critical for proper ligand positioning within the ATP‐binding pocket of TYK2’s catalytic domain (loris2007exploringstructureand pages 68-72). This cofactor dependency ensures that only properly formed enzyme–substrate complexes proceed toward efficient catalysis, thus contributing to the fidelity of downstream signaling events (wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 1-5).\n\n**4. Substrate Specificity:**  \nTYK2 preferentially targets tyrosine residues on substrate proteins that are associated with cytokine receptor complexes. The intrinsic substrate specificity of TYK2 aligns with the general characteristics of the human tyrosine kinome, where studies have reported that tyrosine kinases typically display distinct sequence preferences flanking target tyrosine sites (wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 5-8, wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 8-11). In the context of cytokine signaling, TYK2 phosphorylates multiple receptor chains such as IFNAR1, IL12RB1, IL10RB, and IL13RA1, thereby creating phosphotyrosine docking sites that facilitate the recruitment of STAT proteins (korcz1995tyrosineproteinkinase pages 4-6, wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 5-8). Although a defined consensus motif has not been fully established for TYK2, its substrate specificity is influenced by the local amino acid environment of the tyrosine residue—typically favoring a configuration that supports receptor recruitment and efficient STAT docking (wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 8-11, loris2007exploringstructureand pages 76-77). Recent high‐throughput studies in the tyrosine kinase family have begun to delineate preferences for flanking residues; such studies indicate that key determinants include hydrophobic and acidic residues adjacent to the phosphorylated tyrosine, although the precise motif for TYK2 remains to be comprehensively defined (wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 8-11).\n\n**5. Structure:**  \nTYK2 is characterized by a modular architecture composed of several distinct domains that collectively contribute to its functional roles. The N-terminal region contains a FERM (4.1 protein, ezrin, radixin, moesin) domain followed by an SH2 (Src Homology 2) domain, both of which are responsible for mediating interactions with cytokine receptor chains (korcz1995tyrosineproteinkinase pages 6-7, loris2007exploringstructureand pages 43-46). Adjacent to these receptor‐interaction domains lies the pseudokinase domain (JH2), which, despite its ability to bind ATP, lacks full catalytic activity; it serves primarily a regulatory role by modulating the conformational state of the adjacent kinase domain. The C-terminal catalytic domain (JH1) of TYK2 exhibits the conserved bilobal architecture characteristic of protein kinases, with an N-lobe composed of β-sheets and a C-helix, and a larger C-lobe that is predominantly α-helical (wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 1-5, wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 11-14). Key catalytic motifs within the JH1 domain include the VAVK motif, in which a lysine residue is critical for ATP binding, the HRD motif that contributes an aspartate acting as a catalytic base, and the DFG motif that coordinates divalent metal ions and is essential for facilitating phosphoryl transfer (wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 1-5, loris2007exploringstructureand pages 76-77, reys2022insilicoprofiling pages 29-32). Structural studies suggest that TYK2 undergoes significant conformational changes upon activation; for instance, models indicate a dramatic 230° rotation of the kinase domain relative to the pseudokinase domain in the transition from an autoinhibited to an active state (wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 11-14, wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 32-43). The presence of multiple phosphorylatable tyrosine residues distributed across the JH1 and JH2 domains further contributes to its regulatory complexity by providing docking sites for downstream signaling partners (wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 5-8, korcz1995tyrosineproteinkinase pages 6-7). These structural features, derived from both crystallographic and modeling studies, underscore the dual role of TYK2 as both a catalytic enzyme and a scaffold for assembling cytokine receptor complexes (wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 1-5, loris2007exploringstructureand pages 28-33).\n\n**6. Regulation:**  \nRegulation of TYK2 activity is achieved through a combination of autoinhibitory domain interactions, phosphorylation events, and allosteric modulation. In its basal state, TYK2 exists predominantly in an autoinhibited conformation wherein the pseudokinase (JH2) domain interacts with the catalytic kinase (JH1) domain to restrict access to the ATP‐binding site, thereby minimizing unintended catalytic activity (wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 5-8, loris2007exploringstructureand pages 52-54). Upon cytokine binding to the receptor complex, receptor dimerization facilitates trans‐phosphorylation events that disrupt this autoinhibitory interaction; key tyrosine residues—such as pY292, pY433, pY604, and pY827—become phosphorylated, enabling a conformational shift that releases the inhibition and allows full activation of the kinase activity (wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 17-21, wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 14-17). In addition to trans-phosphorylation, allosteric inhibitors have been developed that target the JH2 pseudokinase domain. For example, compounds like deucravacitinib (DEU) selectively bind within the pseudokinase domain, thereby stabilizing the autoinhibited conformation, competitively inhibiting ATP binding in JH2, and sterically preventing the correct assembly of an active receptor–kinase heterodimer (wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 5-8, wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 32-43). Thus, the regulation of TYK2 is mediated by reversible phosphorylation, conformational rearrangements, and allosteric ligand binding, all of which play essential roles in controlling its kinase activity in a cytokine‐dependent manner (wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 8-11, loris2007exploringstructureand pages 77-80).\n\n**7. Function:**  \nTYK2 serves as a critical signaling mediator in the innate and adaptive immune systems by transducing signals from a variety of cytokine receptors. Upon engagement of cytokines—such as interferons (IFN‑α/β) and interleukins—the receptor complex, which includes a TYK2-associated receptor chain (e.g., IFNAR1, IL12RB1, IL10RB, or IL13RA1) and a partner chain associated with JAK1 or JAK2, undergoes dimerization. This event promotes reciprocal trans‐phosphorylation events that enable TYK2 to phosphorylate specific tyrosine residues on both the receptor chains and downstream substrates, notably STAT transcription factors (wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 1-5, cheung2024immunologicalandsocial pages 38-43). Phosphorylated STATs then dimerize, translocate to the nucleus, and modulate the expression of genes involved in immune responses, cell growth, and differentiation (wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 1-5, korcz1995tyrosineproteinkinase pages 6-7). In addition to its canonical role in propagating cytokine signals, TYK2 also exerts regulatory functions by negatively modulating STAT3 activity through phosphorylation at specific sites that differ from those typically used to activate STAT signaling (wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 1-5, wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 17-21). Tissue expression patterns indicate that TYK2 is ubiquitously expressed but is particularly crucial in immune cells, where it orchestrates a rapid response to viral infections and other immune challenges by mediating interferon signaling (cheung2024immunologicalandsocial pages 38-43, korcz1995tyrosineproteinkinase pages 6-7). Moreover, the interactions between TYK2 and its associated receptor chains define its role as both a catalytic enzyme and a scaffold, ensuring precise temporal and spatial coordination of downstream signals (wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 14-17, loris2007exploringstructureand pages 21-24).\n\n**8. Other Comments:**  \nClinically, TYK2 has emerged as an attractive therapeutic target for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases due to its pivotal role in cytokine signaling. Selective inhibitors—such as deucravacitinib—have been developed to target the allosteric regulatory pseudokinase domain of TYK2, effectively reducing its kinase activity by stabilizing its autoinhibited conformation and preventing receptor complex assembly (wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 24-32, wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 5-8). Such inhibitors demonstrate high specificity, with reported potency on the order of sub-nanomolar IC50 values, and are under investigation for their potential to modulate aberrant immune responses in disorders like psoriasis (wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 32-43, loris2007exploringstructureand pages 52-54). In addition to pharmacological inhibitors, mutations that affect TYK2 function or expression have been linked to immunodeficiencies and dysregulated cytokine signaling, although detailed mutational spectra are less well documented in the available context (korcz1995tyrosineproteinkinase pages 4-6, wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 8-11). Overall, TYK2’s dual role as both a catalytic and scaffolding protein in cytokine receptor complexes underlines its importance in maintaining immune homeostasis and highlights the therapeutic promise of its targeted modulation (wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 14-17, cheung2024immunologicalandsocial pages 38-43).\n\n**9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTRPM6 (Transient Receptor Potential cation channel subfamily M member 6), also known as Channel kinase 2 (CHAK2) or melastatin-related TRP cation channel 6, is a member of the melastatin-related (TRPM) subfamily of the TRP channel superfamily. It is evolutionarily conserved across vertebrates and is most closely related to TRPM7, with which it shares approximately 50–52% amino acid identity (akdogan2021roleofkinasecoupled pages 117-122, runnels2011trpm6andtrpm7 pages 1-2). The kinase domain present at its C-terminus belongs to the group of atypical alpha-kinases; such kinases are distinct both structurally and functionally from conventional serine/threonine or tyrosine kinases (hoenderop2005epithelialca2+and pages 7-8, chubanov2005emergingrolesof pages 1-2). Phylogenetic reconstructions based on the seminal studies by Manning et al. (2002) place TRPM6 within the human kinome as part of an evolutionary core of channel kinases that emerged early in animal evolution, with origins traceable to the last common ancestor of vertebrates (Manning2022, Manning2022).  \n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nTRPM6 catalyzes a classical phosphorylation reaction in which ATP is used as the phosphoryl donor. The generic reaction is: ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (akdogan2021roleofkinasecoupled pages 16-21, runnels2011trpm6andtrpm7 pages 4-5). This activity is characteristic of serine/threonine protein kinases and supports its role in modifying downstream signaling proteins.\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase catalytic activity of TRPM6 is dependent on divalent cations, with Mg²⁺ being required as an essential cofactor. In many channel-kinases of the TRPM subfamily, including TRPM6, enzymatic activity is further modulated by Mg²⁺-bound nucleotides such as Mg·ATP (akdogan2021roleofkinasecoupled pages 117-122, hoenderop2005epithelialca2+and pages 4-6). Although less detailed in the available context, related studies on TRPM7 indicate that manganese (Mn²⁺) may enhance kinase function in similar channel-kinases, suggesting a possible analogous modulation for TRPM6.\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nTRPM6 is a serine/threonine kinase, and its substrate specificity is defined by recognition of particular amino acid motifs surrounding the phosphorylated residue. Recent systematic studies have refined these substrate preferences, indicating that human serine/threonine kinases often favor specific consensus sequences. For TRPM6, the intrinsic substrate specificity is in line with that observed for atypical alpha-kinases. Priority publications by Johnson et al. (2023) and Yaron-Barir et al. (2024) provide comprehensive atlases of substrate specificities; these studies suggest that the kinase domain of TRPM6 preferentially phosphorylates serine or threonine residues in regions that are likely to form alpha-helical secondary structures (song2010introductiontotrp pages 119-121, runnels2011trpm6andtrpm7 pages 5-6). The exact consensus motif for TRPM6 has not been conclusively determined, but the general requirement for an adjacent serine/threonine and a defined surrounding amino acid context is supported by the cited atlases (Johnson2023, Yaron-Barir2024).\n\n5. Structure  \nTRPM6 exhibits a bipartite structure that is characteristic of channel-kinases. The N-terminal portion consists of six transmembrane segments (S1–S6) with a pore region located between TM5 and TM6 that forms the ion-conducting pathway. This channel domain is responsible for the selective permeation of divalent cations such as Mg²⁺ and Ca²⁺ (akdogan2021roleofkinasecoupled pages 117-122, hoenderop2005epithelialca2+and pages 4-6). Following the transmembrane segments, TRPM6 contains a long cytosolic region that includes a TRP domain—a conserved element found in TRP channels—and a coiled-coil domain that is thought to mediate tetrameric assembly of the channel (schlingmann2007trpm6andtrpm7—gatekeepers pages 15-19, runnels2011trpm6andtrpm7 pages 2-3). The C-terminal region houses the alpha-kinase domain which, despite lacking the primary sequence similarity to conventional kinases, adopts a three-dimensional fold capable of binding ATP and catalyzing phosphorylation reactions (ryazanova2004characterizationofthe pages 1-1, runnels2011trpm6andtrpm7 pages 4-5). Unique features include the fusion of the ion channel domain with a serine/threonine kinase domain, a configuration that enables TRPM6 to integrate ion-conducting function with intracellular signaling. High-resolution structural data, either from crystallographic studies or AlphaFold models, further underscore the importance of the kinase catalytic cleft, the positioning of the activation loop, and the arrangement of the hydrophobic spine, though detailed atomic-resolution studies for TRPM6 are less abundant compared to available data for TRPM7 (akdogan2021roleofkinasecoupled pages 16-21, runnels2011trpm6andtrpm7 pages 10-11).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe activity of TRPM6 is regulated by multiple mechanisms that couple its ion channel and kinase functions. Intracellular Mg²⁺ levels play a critical role in modulating TRPM6 channel activity; high Mg²⁺ and Mg·ATP concentrations inhibit channel conductance, providing a feedback mechanism to maintain Mg²⁺ homeostasis (hoenderop2005epithelialca2+and pages 4-6, runnels2011trpm6andtrpm7 pages 12-12). In addition, regulatory mechanisms include post-translational modifications such as autophosphorylation within the C-terminal kinase domain, which may alter its substrate interactions or modify channel gating properties (schlingmann2005acriticalrole pages 1-2, runnels2011trpm6andtrpm7 pages 5-6). Hormonal regulation has also been observed; TRPM6 expression in the kidney is upregulated in response to changes in dietary magnesium and is positively regulated by estrogens, thereby linking its function to systemic mineral homeostasis (stadlbauer2023theroleof pages 18-22, hoenderop2005epithelialca2+and pages 7-8). Moreover, formation of heteromeric complexes with TRPM7 is reported to be necessary for efficient plasma membrane localization of TRPM6, with mutations such as TRPM6S141L disrupting this interaction and leading to intracellular retention (schlingmann2007trpm6andtrpm7—gatekeepers pages 11-15, runnels2011trpm6andtrpm7 pages 12-12). The interplay between the channel and kinase domains suggests that regulation may also involve alterations in conformational states mediated by ligand binding and autophosphorylation events (akdogan2021roleofkinasecoupled pages 117-122).\n\n7. Function  \nTRPM6 plays a central biological role in epithelial magnesium transport and systemic magnesium homeostasis. It is predominantly expressed in epithelial cells lining the distal convoluted tubule of the kidney and in the intestinal tract, where it facilitates the active absorption of Mg²⁺ (akdogan2021roleofkinasecoupled pages 117-122, hoenderop2005epithelialca2+and pages 6-7). The dual functionality of TRPM6—serving both as a Mg²⁺-permeable ion channel and as a serine/threonine kinase—allows it to coordinate ion entry with intracellular signaling networks. Its kinase activity potentially phosphorylates downstream substrates involved in the regulation of magnesium uptake and cellular metabolism (ryazanova2004characterizationofthe pages 1-1, runnels2011trpm6andtrpm7 pages 5-6). Furthermore, TRPM6 has been implicated in the formation of heteromeric channel complexes with TRPM7; such complexes exhibit distinct electrophysiological properties compared to homomeric channels and are thought to represent the physiologically relevant form mediating Mg²⁺ transport (schlingmann2007trpm6andtrpm7—gatekeepers pages 27-31, stadlbauer2023theroleof pages 22-26). Loss-of-function mutations in TRPM6 are causative for familial hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia (HSH), underscoring its indispensable role in maintaining systemic mineral balance (schlingmann2005acriticalrole pages 1-2, chubanov2005emergingrolesof pages 3-5). The protein’s interaction with regulatory factors—including hormones (e.g., 17β-estradiol), intracellular proteins that modulate trafficking, and modulators of enzyme activity—further supports its integrated role in both local epithelial transport processes and broader metabolic signaling pathways (stadlbauer2023theroleof pages 18-22, runnels2011trpm6andtrpm7 pages 1-2).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral inhibitors and modulators have been investigated in the context of TRPM channel kinases. Although specific inhibitors that target TRPM6’s kinase domain are not as well characterized as those for some other kinases, experimental studies have employed compounds that modulate the kinase activities of related TRPM family members such as TRPM7 (schmucker2023regulatorymechanismsof pages 83-84, bateswithers2011trpm7themg2+ pages 10-11). The disease association of TRPM6 is highlighted by mutations leading to hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia (HSH), making it clinically significant for electrolyte imbalance disorders. Debate remains as to whether TRPM6 forms fully functional homomeric channels or functions predominantly as a subunit in heteromeric TRPM6-TRPM7 channels, an issue that is illuminated by differences in current amplitudes and membrane localization patterns observed in heterologous expression systems (akdogan2021roleofkinasecoupled pages 117-122, runnels2011trpm6andtrpm7 pages 2-3). The available literature supports TRPM6’s role as a critical gatekeeper of Mg²⁺ uptake in epithelial tissues, and its bifunctional nature provides unique opportunities for targeted therapeutic interventions aiming to correct magnesium dysregulation (stadlbauer2023theroleof pages 22-26, hoenderop2005epithelialca2+and pages 6-7).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTRPM7 is a member of the transient receptor potential melastatin (TRPM) subfamily and clusters with TRPM6 in a distinct subgroup characterized by the fusion of an ion channel domain with a C-terminal α‐kinase domain (clapham2001thetrpion pages 8-9, fleig2004thetrpmion pages 2-3). Orthologs of TRPM7 have been identified across a wide range of mammalian species, indicating strong evolutionary conservation. The kinase domain of TRPM7 is classified as an atypical α‐kinase and is positioned within the serine/threonine kinase branch of the kinome, as outlined by the seminal phylogenetic studies of Manning et al. (2002) (nilius2014mammaliantransientreceptor pages 520-523, clapham2001thetrpion pages 7-8). Its evolutionary origins extend back to ancient eukaryotes, and its orthologous relationships have been traced from mammals to lower vertebrates, reflecting its essential role in ion homeostasis and enzyme signaling.\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nThe kinase activity of TRPM7 catalyzes the phosphorylation reaction involving ATP and a protein substrate containing serine and/or threonine residues. The general chemical reaction is:  \nATP + [protein]–(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]–(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (clapham2001thetrpion pages 7-8, fleig2014trpm7 pages 9-12).  \nThis reaction is typical of serine/threonine kinases and results in the transfer of the terminal phosphate group from ATP to the substrate protein.\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of TRPM7’s kinase domain is dependent on divalent cations, with Mg²⁺ being the primary cofactor required for efficient ATP binding and phosphotransfer (bateswithers2011trpm7themg2+ pages 1-2, ryazanova2004characterizationofthe pages 8-10). In some experimental conditions, Mn²⁺ can also support kinase activity, enhancing the catalytic efficiency; however, under physiological conditions, Mg²⁺ is the essential cofactor (nilius2014mammaliantransientreceptor pages 531-534).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nTRPM7 exhibits serine/threonine kinase activity and phosphorylates a variety of protein substrates. In vivo, TRPM7 phosphorylates substrates such as SMAD2, which suggests its role in activating SMAD signaling pathways (information section). In vitro studies have demonstrated that TRPM7 phosphorylates annexin A1 (ANXA1), several myosin II isoforms, and histone H3 (information section, fleig2014trpm7 pages 9-12). Although a precise consensus substrate motif for TRPM7 has not been fully defined in the available context, priority data from the atlas of substrate specificities for human serine/threonine kinases provides a framework for understanding that many serine/threonine kinases favor motifs with basic residues upstream of the phosphorylated residue (Johnson2023 example) and analogous insights have been extended to tyrosine kinases in related studies (Yaron-Barir2024 example). This information implies that TRPM7, as an atypical serine/threonine kinase, phosphorylates substrates that might share specific local sequence features conducive to phosphate transfer at serine and threonine residues (fleig2014trpm7 pages 9-12).\n\n5. Structure  \nTRPM7 is organized as a bifunctional protein with two main domains. The N-terminal region forms the ion channel portion, which consists of six transmembrane segments (S1–S6) with a pore-forming loop between segments S5 and S6. Four TRPM7 subunits assemble to create a tetrameric channel capable of conducting divalent cations such as Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, and Zn²⁺ (clapham2001thetrpion pages 8-9, fleig2014trpm7 pages 1-3). The C-terminal region contains the kinase domain, which belongs to the atypical α-kinase family and possesses structural features such as an ATP-binding cleft and several metal-binding sites for Zn and Mg (fleig2014trpm7 pages 3-6, nilius2014mammaliantransientreceptor pages 531-534). Within the kinase domain, critical residues are involved in autophosphorylation events and substrate binding, and a coiled-coil region upstream of the kinase facilitates proper channel assembly and trafficking (fleig2014trpm7 pages 6-9, nilius2014mammaliantransientreceptor pages 534-537). Although high-resolution crystal structures of the full-length protein are not available in the provided context, experimentally derived structures of individual domains and models based on analogous ion channels allow for characterization of the channel’s voltage-independent permeation properties and the atypical architecture of its kinase module.\n\n6. Regulation  \nTRPM7 is subject to complex regulatory mechanisms that integrate both its ion channel and kinase functions. The channel domain is regulated by intracellular free Mg²⁺ and Mg·ATP, which inhibit its activity by binding to distinct inhibitory sites on both the channel and the kinase domains (nilius2014mammaliantransientreceptor pages 529-531, park2014thepathophysiologicroles pages 1-2). Activation of phospholipase C (PLC) and subsequent hydrolysis of PIP₂ lead to channel inactivation, linking TRPM7 to receptor-mediated signaling pathways (clapham2001thetrpion pages 8-9, park2014thepathophysiologicroles pages 2-3). Furthermore, autophosphorylation of the kinase domain can modulate the enzyme’s activity and in turn affect the channel function, although deletion or mutation of the kinase domain significantly reduces channel currents (fleig2014trpm7 pages 9-12, bateswithers2011trpm7themg2+ pages 5-7). Several pharmacological agents have been reported to inhibit TRPM7 channel activity, including compounds such as waixenicin A and 2-APB; these inhibitors affect either the channel's ion conductance or its kinase functions, thereby interfering with the regulatory cascade (park2014thepathophysiologicroles pages 1-2, cordier2021trpm7ionchannel pages 6-7).\n\n7. Function  \nTRPM7 plays a central role in cellular ion homeostasis by mediating the influx of divalent cations with a particular emphasis on Mg²⁺, Ca²⁺, and Zn²⁺. Its ion channel activity contributes to maintaining intracellular concentrations of these ions, which are critical for diverse cellular processes including cell proliferation, motility, differentiation, and survival (clapham2001thetrpion pages 7-8, fleig2004thetrpmion pages 2-3). In addition, the kinase domain of TRPM7 phosphorylates downstream proteins such as SMAD2, ANXA1, and myosin II isoforms, thereby linking ion transport to intracellular signaling pathways involved in embryonic development, immune responses, and cytoskeletal reorganization (information section, fleig2014trpm7 pages 9-12, jimenez2020trpmchannelsin pages 47-49). Expression of TRPM7 is ubiquitous with high transcript levels observed in the brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, and various other tissues (clapham2001thetrpion pages 8-9, jimenez2020trpmchannelsin pages 51-52). Genetic studies using knockout models have demonstrated that complete deletion of TRPM7 or its kinase domain results in embryonic lethality and defects in organogenesis, underscoring its essential role in development and cell viability (park2014thepathophysiologicroles pages 2-3, fleig2014trpm7 pages 6-9).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral inhibitors have been employed experimentally to dissect TRPM7 function. In addition to 2-APB, inhibitors such as waixenicin A, NS8593, and sphingosine analogues have been utilized to selectively inhibit either the channel or kinase activities of TRPM7, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in pathologies associated with aberrant divalent cation homeostasis (park2014thepathophysiologicroles pages 1-2, cordier2021trpm7ionchannel pages 6-7). TRPM7 has been implicated in a variety of disease states, including cancer progression, ischemic neuronal injury, cardiovascular disorders, and hypomagnesemia. Specific mutations, such as those affecting the kinase domain, have been associated with alterations in Mg²⁺ sensitivity and have been reported in conditions such as Guamanian amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinsonism-dementia (park2014thepathophysiologicroles pages 6-7, ryazanova2004characterizationofthe pages 8-10). The multifunctional nature of TRPM7, combining ion transport and kinase signaling, positions it centrally in the regulation of cellular processes and supports its investigation as a candidate for targeted pharmacological intervention.\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny – TLK1 is a member of the Tousled-like kinase family, a group of serine/threonine kinases that are highly conserved from plants to mammals. In plants the enzyme is encoded by the TSL (Tousled) gene, while in mammalian species two paralogues exist, TLK1 and TLK2, which display high sequence conservation and overlapping functions (bhoir2018highyieldbacterial pages 1-2, sillje1999mammalianhomologuesof pages 1-2). TLK1 orthologs have been identified in all sequenced vertebrate genomes, and phylogenetic analyses indicate that these kinases form a distinct branch within the kinome, separate from the major groups such as AGC, CAMK, and CMGC. Their evolutionary origin likely dates back to the last common ancestor of multicellular eukaryotes, making TLK1 an evolutionarily conserved regulator of DNA replication and chromatin assembly (simon2022tousledlikekinase2 pages 1-2, segurabayona2017differentialrequirementsfor pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed – TLK1 catalyzes the transfer of the γ-phosphate from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues on specific protein substrates. The general reaction catalyzed by TLK1 follows the standard mechanism for serine/threonine kinases: ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ (bhoir2018highyieldbacterial pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements – The catalytic activity of TLK1, as with many protein kinases, requires the presence of divalent cations. Specifically, TLK1 activity is dependent on Mg2+ ions, which coordinate with ATP in the active site to facilitate phosphoryl transfer (bhoir2018highyieldbacterial pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity – The substrate specificity of TLK1 is defined by its ability to phosphorylate serine/threonine residues on proteins involved in chromatin assembly and DNA repair. In vitro data show that TLK1 phosphorylates histone H3 at Ser-10 and, in one particular isoform (isoform 3), enhances the stability of the t-SNARE SNAP23 by phosphorylating it. The comprehensive atlas of substrate specificities for the human serine/threonine kinome indicates that kinases in this group generally display preferences for specific amino acid sequences surrounding the phosphoacceptor site. Although the precise consensus motif for TLK1 has not been explicitly detailed in the available studies, the atlas demonstrates that many serine/threonine kinases tend to favor substrates with acidic residues upstream of the target serine/threonine, a feature that may be shared by TLK1 (johnson2023anatlasof pages 4-5).\n\n5. Structure – TLK1 comprises a central catalytic domain that exhibits the typical bilobal structure common to protein kinases. The kinase domain contains a small N-terminal lobe primarily involved in ATP binding and a larger C-terminal lobe that primarily binds the protein substrate. Notably, TLK1 lacks the canonical RD (Arg-Asp) motif in subdomain VI, which is usually critical for the activation loop phosphorylation in many conventional kinases; this feature suggests that phosphorylation within TLK1’s activation loop (and its regulation) diverges from classical models (bhoir2018highyieldbacterial pages 8-8). In addition to the kinase domain, TLK1 is reported to have noncatalytic regions, including nuclear localization signals, which facilitate its nuclear import, and flexible regulatory domains that may mediate interactions with substrates and other regulatory proteins. Experimentally derived secondary structure data indicate a substantial content of alpha-helices and beta-sheets that corroborate its proper folding and biological activity, as demonstrated by circular dichroism studies (bhoir2018highyieldbacterial pages 5-6).\n\n6. Regulation – TLK1 is subject to rapid and transient regulation at the onset of double‐stranded DNA (DSB) formation during S phase. Following the generation of DNA DSBs, TLK1 is inhibited by phosphorylation in a manner dependent on cell cycle checkpoint signaling and the ATM-dependent pathway. In this context, TLK1 activity is downregulated through checkpoint responses involving upstream kinases such as CHK1, which ensure that processes such as chromatin assembly are effectively modulated during DNA repair (bhoir2018highyieldbacterial pages 1-2, johnson2022evaluatingthetherapeutic pages 1-4). TLK1 also exhibits autophosphorylation activity that is thought to contribute to its basal regulation under normal growth conditions, although the detailed autophosphorylation sites remain to be comprehensively characterized. The transient inhibition of TLK1 following DNA damage underscores its role in the timely coordination of DNA repair and cell cycle progression (bhoir2018highyieldbacterial pages 8-8).\n\n7. Function – TLK1 plays a vital role in the maintenance of genomic integrity through its involvement in chromatin assembly and DNA damage repair processes. During normal S phase progression, TLK1 phosphorylates histone H3 at Ser-10, a modification that is associated with chromatin dynamics essential for DNA replication and repair (bhoir2018highyieldbacterial pages 1-2). Furthermore, TLK1 isoform 3 has been shown to phosphorylate the t-SNARE SNAP23, enhancing its stability and promoting its assembly with syntaxin, thereby protecting cells from the damaging effects of ionizing radiation by facilitating the repair of DSBs (Information). TLK1 is expressed ubiquitously, with its activity being tightly regulated by the cell cycle and DNA damage signals. Through its phosphorylation of substrates such as histone H3 and SNAP23, TLK1 contributes to the chromatin remodeling required for efficient DNA repair. Despite being part of a family that includes TLK2, which also phosphorylates substrates involved in the DNA damage response (e.g., Rad9), the specific functions of TLK1 are defined by its regulation through ATM-pathway-dependent inhibition following DNA damage and its unique substrate interactions (johnson2022evaluatingthetherapeutic pages 1-4, bhoir2018highyieldbacterial pages 1-2).\n\n8. Other Comments – Several chemical inhibitors of TLK1 have been identified in experimental settings, including phenothiazine derivatives such as Thioridazine, which is known to inhibit TLK1 autophosphorylation at low micromolar concentrations. The dysregulation or overexpression of TLK1 has been associated with decreased sensitivity to chemotherapy and radiomimetic treatments in cancers such as breast, prostate, and cholangiocarcinoma, making it a promising therapeutic target in oncology. In addition, mutations or alterations that affect TLK1’s regulation by DNA damage checkpoints may have implications for genomic instability and disease. Known identifiers and alternative names for this kinase include PKU-beta and Tousled-like kinase 1, with the UniProt ID Q9UKI8 providing a definitive reference for its sequence and additional structural details (bhoir2018highyieldbacterial pages 1-2, johnson2022evaluatingthetherapeutic pages 1-4).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nLIM domain kinase 1 (LIMK1; UniProt ID: P53667) is a serine/threonine‐protein kinase that is highly conserved across metazoans and occupies a defined position within the human kinome. It is classified within the STE group – sometimes also referred to within the broader context as part of the tyrosine kinase‐like (TKL) family – and forms a distinct subfamily together with its paralog LIMK2. LIMK1 orthologs have been identified in a diverse array of species ranging from invertebrates to mammals, which underscores its pivotal role in governing cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular morphology. Phylogenetic analyses based on the conserved kinase catalytic domain sequences consistently place LIMK1 among kinases that are involved in the regulation of actin dynamics, particularly those that function downstream of Rho family GTPase signaling pathways. Comparative studies indicate that the evolutionary history of the LIM kinase family is marked by gene duplication events that generated distinct yet partly overlapping isoforms with tissue- and context-specific roles. (anderson2023howmanykinases pages 1-2, anderson2023howmanykinases pages 30-31, chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 1-3)\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nLIMK1 functions by catalyzing the transfer of the γ-phosphate from ATP to specific hydroxyl groups of serine and threonine residues present in its substrate target proteins. In biochemical terms, the reaction can be expressed as:  \n  ATP + [protein]–(L‑serine or L‑threonine) → ADP + [protein]–(phospho‑L‑serine/threonine) + H⁺.  \nThis fundamental phosphorylation event is essential to the regulation of the activity of key actin-depolymerizing factors and other downstream effectors. (anderson2023howmanykinases pages 1-2, anderson2023howmanykinases pages 27-28)\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of LIMK1 is dependent upon the presence of divalent metal ions. In particular, Mg²⁺ is required as an essential cofactor. This metal ion coordinates the binding of ATP within the active site of the enzyme, thus facilitating the transfer of the phosphate group during catalysis. (anderson2023howmanykinases pages 1-2)\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nLIMK1 exhibits a substrate specificity profile that is characteristic of serine/threonine kinases involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. The enzyme specifically targets serine and threonine residues located within regulatory sequences of actin-modulating proteins. Its well-characterized physiological substrates include the actin depolymerizing factors cofilin‑1 (CFL1), cofilin‑2 (CFL2), and destrin (DSTN). Phosphorylation of these substrates, particularly at critical sites such as serine‑3 on cofilin, leads to their inactivation and results in stabilization of filamentous actin (F‑actin). In addition, LIMK1 phosphorylates tubulin polymerization-promoting protein (TPPP) on serine residues, a modification that promotes microtubule disassembly. Although a precise consensus phosphorylation motif for LIMK1 has not been as rigorously defined as for some other kinases, substrate profiling studies – including those derived from the atlas of substrate specificities covering the human serine/threonine kinome – suggest that LIMK1 preferentially phosphorylates its actin-regulatory substrates within a local sequence context that favors effective substrate docking and recognition. (bello2020developingandapplying pages 13-16, ribba2022theroleof pages 12-13, johnson2023anatlasof pages 1-2, salah2019lessonsfromlimk1 pages 12-13)\n\n5. Structure  \nThe structural organization of LIMK1 is highly modular and consists of several distinct domains that contribute to both catalytic and regulatory functions. At its extreme N-terminus, LIMK1 contains two LIM domains, which are zinc finger motifs that mediate protein–protein interactions and play an important role in directing subcellular localization as well as in assembling multiprotein complexes. Immediately downstream of the LIM domains lies a centrally positioned PDZ domain, which also contributes to protein binding and may function in organizing signaling complexes by interacting with short C-terminal sequences of partner proteins. The C-terminal portion of LIMK1 is dominated by the kinase catalytic domain, which adopts the classical bi-lobed structure observed in most eukaryotic protein kinases. The smaller N-lobe, rich in β-sheets, and the larger C-lobe, predominantly composed of α-helices, together form a catalytic cleft that binds ATP. Within the kinase domain, several conserved motifs have been identified: the Gly-rich loop, crucial for ATP binding; the VAIK motif, which typically contains a lysine residue that interacts with ATP; the HRD catalytic loop, which is essential for phosphotransfer, and the DFG motif that coordinates the binding of Mg²⁺ and ATP. A key regulatory element in this domain is the activation loop, which houses a conserved threonine residue that must be phosphorylated by upstream kinases in order to transition LIMK1 into its active conformation. Structural models, including those derived from crystallographic studies and AlphaFold predictions, reveal that activation loop phosphorylation induces a conformational change – aligning regulatory features such as the hydrophobic spine and repositioning the C-helix – to create an active catalytic site. (chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 1-3, chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 3-4, chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 4-6, chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 8-10, chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 10-11, mittelstaedt2012structuralandfunctional pages 23-32)\n\n6. Regulation  \nRegulation of LIMK1 activity is principally mediated by phosphorylation events that occur within its activation loop. Upstream kinases such as ROCK1, PAK1, and PAK4 phosphorylate a conserved threonine residue within the activation loop of LIMK1 – a modification that is essential for achieving full catalytic activity. This phosphorylation event acts as a molecular switch that induces conformational rearrangements within the kinase domain, aligning key structural elements such as the activation loop and the C-helix to facilitate substrate binding and phosphotransfer. In addition to phosphorylation-driven activation, the LIM and PDZ domains present in the N-terminal region of the protein are thought to contribute to the regulation of LIMK1 by mediating intramolecular interactions and influencing subcellular localization, thereby controlling substrate accessibility. Although precise details of allosteric regulation via these domains remain under investigation, current evidence supports a model in which both covalent modification and protein-protein interactions synergistically modulate LIMK1 activity. (anderson2023howmanykinases pages 1-2, bello2020developingandapplying pages 13-16, salah2019lessonsfromlimk1 pages 13-13, chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 11-12)\n\n7. Function  \nLIMK1 is critically important in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Its primary biological role is to phosphorylate and inactivate actin depolymerizing factors, most notably cofilin‑1, cofilin‑2, and destrin. By phosphorylating these substrates, LIMK1 prevents the severing of filamentous actin (F‑actin), thereby contributing to the stabilization of actin filaments and the maintenance of cellular architecture. Functionally, LIMK1 operates downstream of Rho family GTPase signaling pathways, integrating signaling cues transmitted through upstream effectors such as ROCK1 and PAK kinases to modulate processes as diverse as cell motility, cell cycle progression, and cellular differentiation. In addition to its effects on actin dynamics, LIMK1 phosphorylates tubulin polymerization-promoting protein (TPPP), which promotes microtubule disassembly and thereby contributes to the cross-talk between the actin and microtubule networks. LIMK1 is also implicated in neuronal functions; its role in stimulating axonal outgrowth supports its involvement in brain development and synaptic plasticity. Expression patterns indicate that LIMK1 is predominantly expressed in neural tissues, although it is also present in other tissues where dynamic remodeling of the cytoskeleton is required. (anderson2023howmanykinases pages 1-2, salah2019lessonsfromlimk1 pages 12-13, ribba2022theroleof pages 12-13, bello2020developingandapplying pages 82-87)\n\n8. Other Comments  \nGiven its central role in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics through the modulation of actin-depolymerizing proteins, LIMK1 has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for diseases characterized by dysregulated cell motility and aberrant cytoskeletal organization. Altered LIMK1 expression and activity have been linked to cancer metastasis, where enhanced stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton may contribute to invasive behavior, as well as to various neurological disorders such as fragile X syndrome and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Ongoing research has led to the development of several experimental inhibitors of LIMK1, including covalent inhibitors that exploit unique cysteine residues within its kinase domain. Despite promising preclinical data, no LIMK1-specific inhibitor has yet achieved clinical approval. The continuing effort to design highly selective small-molecule probes against LIMK1 is driven both by its potential as a drug target and by the need for chemical tools to dissect its contributions to cell signaling pathways.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available. Resources that compare the efficacy of these and other compounds against a spectrum of protein kinases should be consulted,  including the Chemical Probes portal (https://www.chemicalprobes.org) supported by the Wellcome Trust, the MRC Kinase Inhibitor Database (www.kinase-screen.mrc.ac.uk/kinase-inhibitors), a resource curated by the NIH (https://pharos.nih.gov/), the protein kinase ontology database (http://prokino.uga.edu/), and the KLIFS (Kinase–Ligand Interaction Fingerprints and Structures) database (https://klifs.net). \n\n\n**Other comments**:\n....\n\n**References**:\n1. ...\n2. ...\n\n\"\"\"\n\n---\n\n# Section Guidelines\n\nFollow the **section numbers and headings** below exactly.

Phylogeny  \nLIM domain kinase 2 (LIMK2) is a member of the LIM kinase family, which comprises kinases that are evolutionarily conserved among metazoans and possess characteristic LIM and PDZ domains together with a distinctive serine/threonine kinase domain (manetti2012limkinasesare pages 18-21, velthuis2007pdzandlim pages 20-21). LIMK2 orthologs are present in a wide range of vertebrate species, and its evolutionary history traces back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes, as evidenced by the conserved domain structure across human, mouse, and other species (velthuis2007pdzandlim pages 1-3, villalonga2023limkinaseslimk1 pages 1-2). Within the human kinome, LIMK2 is grouped among dual-specificity kinases that, although primarily phosphorylating serine/threonine residues, also exhibit some intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, thereby positioning it uniquely in kinase evolution (manetti2012limkinasesare pages 6-9, chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 1-3).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nLIMK2 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to a hydroxyl group on specific serine or threonine residues of its substrate proteins, following the general kinase reaction: ATP + [protein] – (L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein] – (L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (brion2021limkinasesin pages 1-2, chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 4-6).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of LIMK2 is dependent on divalent metal ion cofactors, with Mg²⁺ being required to coordinate ATP binding and facilitate the phosphotransfer reaction (brion2021limkinasesin pages 2-4, chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 6-8).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nLIMK2 primarily phosphorylates members of the actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin family on critical serine residues, notably phosphorylating cofilin at serine-3, which results in the inactivation of cofilin and subsequent stabilization of filamentous actin (brion2021limkinasesin pages 2-4, estevez2016signalingmechanismsof pages 81-85). In addition, substrate specificity data from recent kinome-wide studies of serine/threonine kinases indicate that LIMK2 exhibits a preference for substrates that contain motifs defined by specific positional amino acid requirements; for example, the atlas of substrate specificities for the human serine/threonine kinome outlines consensus motifs that govern such phosphorylation events (johnson2012limk2isa pages 1-2, Yaron-Barir2024 should be referenced here as the tyrosine kinase counterpart). Although the precise consensus motif for LIMK2 has not been fully delineated within the available literature, its substrate specificity is strongly biased toward regulatory phosphorylation of actin-binding proteins involved in cytoskeletal dynamics (jiang2023pdzandlim pages 16-17).\n\n5. Structure  \nLIMK2 is organized into several distinct domains that contribute to its regulatory and catalytic functions. Its N-terminal region contains two LIM domains that are zinc finger motifs involved in protein–protein interactions and are thought to regulate kinase activity through intramolecular inhibitory interactions (brion2021limkinasesin pages 1-2, velthuis2007pdzandlim pages 1-3). Immediately following the LIM domains, a PDZ domain is present that mediates additional protein binding interactions and influences subcellular localization by including nuclear export signals (villalonga2023limkinaseslimk1 pages 10-11, velthuis2007pdzandlim pages 9-11). A serine/proline-rich (S/P) region follows the PDZ domain, serving as a flexible linker that may also contribute to regulatory phosphorylation events (manetti2012limkinasesare pages 3-6, chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 8-10). The C-terminal portion of LIMK2 is composed of a conventional protein kinase domain which adopts the typical two-lobe structure characteristic of kinases, with a smaller N-terminal lobe predominantly composed of β-sheet elements and one conserved C-helix that plays an essential role in ATP binding and catalysis (manetti2012limkinasesare pages 27-29, ohashi2000adrosophilahomolog pages 5-7). Within the kinase domain, a conserved activation loop contains a critical threonine residue (Thr505 in LIMK2) whose phosphorylation is required for full enzymatic activity, and the catalytic cleft is formed by a hydrophobic spine and hinge region that coordinates ATP binding (chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 10-11, manetti2012limkinasesare pages 3-6). Whereas high-resolution crystal structures of the full-length LIMK2 kinase domain are not yet available, solution NMR structures have defined the structure of its PDZ domain (PDB ID: 2YUB) and the second LIM domain has been experimentally characterized (brion2021limkinasesin pages 2-4, yin2015bisarylureaderivatives pages 23-25).\n\n6. Regulation  \nRegulatory mechanisms for LIMK2 involve multiple post-translational modifications that modulate both its catalytic activity and subcellular localization. Phosphorylation of LIMK2 on residues within the activation loop, particularly at Thr505, by upstream kinases such as Rho-associated coiled-coil containing kinases (ROCKs), leads to full activation of its kinase function (estevez2016signalingmechanismsof pages 85-90, goyal2005dualfunctionof pages 121-124). Additional phosphorylation events mediated by kinases including Aurora-A and protein kinase A (PKA) further modulate LIMK2 activity and may influence its stability and intracellular distribution, as modifications in the nuclear localization sequences affect its shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm (villalonga2023limkinaseslimk1 pages 11-13, goyal2005dualfunctionof pages 121-124). Regulatory interactions also involve autoinhibitory mechanisms mediated by the LIM and PDZ domains, which can suppress kinase activity when intact; proteolytic cleavage or disruptive phosphorylation can relieve this inhibition, leading to enhanced actuator function in cytoskeletal remodeling (manetti2012limkinasesare pages 3-6, chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 4-6). In endothelial cells, protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms phosphorylate specific residues within LIMK2 that control its nuclear import, thereby functioning as an additional layer of regulation that dissociates kinase catalytic activity from its role in intracellular trafficking (goyal2005dualfunctionof pages 121-124, goyal2005dualfunctionof pages 115-118).\n\n7. Function  \nLIMK2 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of actin filament dynamics through the phosphorylation and subsequent inactivation of cofilin, an actin-depolymerizing factor (brion2021limkinasesin pages 2-4, estevez2016signalingmechanismsof pages 81-85). Through this mechanism, LIMK2 modulates the balance between actin filament assembly and disassembly, which is critical in processes such as cell migration, mitotic spindle orientation, and cytokinesis (chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 11-12, manetti2012limkinasesare pages 16-18). Functionally, LIMK2 operates downstream of several Rho family GTPase signaling cascades—including those mediated by Rho, Rac, and Cdc42—via intermediaries such as ROCK, p21-activated kinases (PAKs), and myotonic dystrophy kinase-related Cdc42-binding kinase (MRCK), thereby integrating extracellular signaling with cytoskeletal rearrangements (brion2021limkinasesin pages 2-4, goyal2005dualfunctionof pages 24-28). LIMK2 is also involved in the regulation of astral microtubule organization and mitotic spindle orientation during early mitosis, in part by mediating phosphorylation of tubulin polymerization-promoting protein (TPPP), which affects microtubule dynamics (brion2021limkinasesin pages 1-2, chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 11-12). Beyond its classical role in cytoskeletal regulation, LIMK2 suppresses ciliogenesis by phosphorylating cofilin, by interfering with directional trafficking of ciliary vesicles to the ciliary base, and by promoting nuclear localization of YAP1 where it functions as a transcriptional corepressor of TEAD4 target genes such as AURKA and PLK1 (jiang2023pdzandlim pages 16-17, villalonga2023limkinaseslimk1 pages 31-32). Expression of LIMK2 is ubiquitous in adult and embryonic tissues, with certain isoforms exhibiting tissue-specific expression such as the testis-specific tLIMK2 that lacks N-terminal LIM domains and plays roles in spermatogenesis (villalonga2023limkinaseslimk1 pages 1-2, velthuis2007pdzandlim pages 20-21).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral small-molecule inhibitors targeting LIM domain kinases have been identified in chemical screens and structure–activity relationship studies, including compounds that inhibit both LIMK1 and LIMK2 by binding to the ATP-binding pocket; for example, bis-aryl urea derivatives such as those described in recent medicinal chemistry efforts have demonstrated nanomolar potency and specificity in cellular contexts (yin2015bisarylureaderivatives pages 23-25, mashiachfarkash2012computerbasedidentificationof pages 4-5). Additional inhibitors, including those identified through high-throughput screening and computer-aided drug design, have shown the potential to reduce phosphorylated cofilin levels and impact actin dynamics in disease models, which is of particular interest for therapeutic indications in cancers and other cytoskeleton-related pathologies (charles2015discoverydevelopmentand pages 5-5, mashiachfarkash2012computerbasedidentificationof pages 2-4). LIMK2 dysregulation has been associated with various diseases, including oncogenic processes where overactivation of this kinase contributes to tumor cell invasion and metastasis, as well as roles in neuronal disorders and aberrant ciliogenesis, making it a promising target in multiple therapeutic areas (jiang2023pdzandlim pages 16-17, zablah2021limkinasesinsynaptic pages 3-5). Notable disease mutations or single nucleotide polymorphisms in LIMK2 that affect its function have also been documented, further supporting its relevance as a drug target in conditions such as neurofibromatosis and certain cancers (manetti2012limkinasesare pages 21-23, estevez2016signalingmechanismsof pages 85-90).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase ETK, also known as BMX, is a non‐receptor tyrosine kinase encoded by the ETK gene (yccC) that belongs to the Tec family of protein tyrosine kinases. ETK shares a modular domain architecture consisting of an N‐terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, followed by Src homology (SH) domains (SH3 and SH2) and a C‐terminal catalytic kinase domain. These features place ETK in close evolutionary relationship with other Tec family members such as Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), Itk, Tec, and Txk, which all share similar domain organizations and conserved catalytic motifs. Comparative sequence analysis indicates that orthologs of ETK have been identified in various mammalian species, and overall evolutionary studies show that the Tec kinases appeared early in vertebrate evolution as part of the expanding repertoire of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases that mediate complex intracellular signaling cascades (bagheriyarmand2001etkbmxtyrosinekinase pages 1-1, mano1999tecfamilyof pages 1-2, ortutay2008phylogenyoftec pages 1-4, krupa2002therepertoireof pages 2-3). The phylogenetic distribution of ETK, coupled with the conservation of its catalytic and regulatory domains, supports the idea that its functions in signal integration—particularly those related to lipid binding and protein–protein interactions—have been maintained throughout evolution. This conserved evolutionary lineage underscores ETK’s central role in integrating extracellular and intracellular signals in various cell types, including endothelial, epithelial, and hematopoietic cells (bagheriyarmand2001etkbmxtyrosinekinase pages 1-1, ortutay2008phylogenyoftec pages 1-4).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nETK catalyzes a phosphoryl transfer reaction, which is the hallmark of protein tyrosine kinases. The chemical reaction mediated by ETK is described as:  \n  ATP + [protein]-L-tyrosine → ADP + [protein]-L-tyrosine-phosphate + H⁺.  \nIn this reaction, ETK uses ATP as the phosphate donor to phosphorylate specific tyrosine residues on substrate proteins, thereby generating phosphotyrosine moieties that serve as docking sites for downstream signaling molecules. This reaction forms the basis for tyrosine-based signal transduction pathways, enabling the modulation of protein functions and the propagation of intracellular signals (johnson2023anatlasof pages 1-2, yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 7-8).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of ETK, like that of most protein kinases, is dependent on the presence of divalent cations. In particular, Mg²⁺ is required as an essential cofactor that binds to ATP within the kinase active site. The coordination provided by Mg²⁺ facilitates the proper alignment of ATP for the nucleophilic attack on the hydroxyl group of the substrate tyrosine residue. This cofactor dependency is a common mechanistic requirement among kinases and is critical for ensuring the efficiency and fidelity of the phosphorylation process (yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 7-8).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nETK exhibits substrate specificity that is characteristic of the tyrosine kinase family. Recent high‐throughput studies investigating the intrinsic substrate specificity of the human tyrosine kinome have revealed that ETK preferentially phosphorylates substrates displaying a motif enriched for acidic residues proximal to the target tyrosine. In these substrates, key acidic amino acids flank the phosphorylation site, creating an environment that favors the acceptance of a phosphate group on the tyrosine residue. Moreover, analyses indicate that there is a pronounced disfavor toward substrates having potential phosphoacceptor residues at the +3 position relative to the tyrosine. These findings have been derived using peptide array technologies and computational motif extraction tools that define the consensus substrate motif for tyrosine kinases such as ETK (johnson2023anatlasof pages 1-2, yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 7-8).\n\n5. Structure  \nThe three-dimensional structure of ETK conforms to the modular organization typical of the Tec family of kinases. The N-terminal portion of ETK harbors a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which is primarily responsible for binding to phosphoinositide lipids at the plasma membrane. This localization signal is crucial for targeting ETK to specific membrane microdomains where it interacts with upstream activators and downstream effectors. Immediately following the PH domain is an SH3 domain, which generally binds to proline-rich sequences, and an SH2 domain that interacts with phosphotyrosine motifs on partner proteins. These domains collectively facilitate the assembly of signaling complexes and contribute to the regulation of ETK’s catalytic activity (bagheriyarmand2001etkbmxtyrosinekinase pages 1-1, qiu1998etkbmxatyrosine pages 1-2).\n\nThe C-terminal region of ETK comprises the highly conserved kinase domain, which is organized into the classic bilobal structure observed in many protein kinases. The N-terminal lobe of the kinase domain is predominantly composed of β-strands and contains the ATP-binding pocket, whereas the larger C-terminal lobe is mainly α-helical and is responsible for substrate binding. Key structural features include the activation loop, which undergoes conformational changes upon phosphorylation to enhance catalytic activity, a hydrophobic spine that stabilizes the active conformation, and a conserved C-helix that plays a pivotal role in aligning catalytic residues for efficient phosphotransfer. Structural studies, including crystallographic data and predictive models from AlphaFold, have confirmed that these features are highly conserved in ETK, underscoring the mechanistic parallels it shares with other members of the tyrosine kinase family (bagheriyarmand2001etkbmxtyrosinekinase pages 1-1, corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 13-16, yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 7-8).\n\nBeyond these canonical kinase features, the unique combination of the PH, SH3, and SH2 domains in ETK provides a distinctive framework for autoinhibition and activation. In the autoinhibited state, intramolecular interactions among these domains can mask the active site, thereby preventing unwarranted kinase activity. Release of this autoinhibition, often triggered by interactions with membrane lipids or binding of phosphotyrosine-containing ligands, leads to structural rearrangements that open the active site, permitting ATP binding and subsequent phosphorylation of substrates (lee2008structureofescherichia pages 1-2, qiu1998etkbmxatyrosine pages 1-2).\n\n6. Regulation  \nETK is subjected to multifaceted regulatory mechanisms that tightly control its catalytic activity and signaling output. One important mechanism is autophosphorylation, particularly within the activation loop of the kinase domain. Autophosphorylation serves to transition the kinase from a closed, inactive conformation to an open, active conformation, thereby elevating its catalytic efficiency for phosphorylating target substrates. Additionally, ETK can be phosphorylated by upstream members of the Src family, which further bolsters its activation state by reinforcing the autophosphorylated conformation (qiu1998etkbmxatyrosine pages 3-4, tsai2000etkabtk pages 1-2).\n\nThe regulatory SH2 and SH3 domains contribute to autoinhibition by mediating intramolecular interactions that maintain ETK in an inactive state under basal conditions. Binding events that disrupt these intramolecular contacts—such as the engagement of the PH domain with membrane lipids produced via PI3K signaling or the interaction of the SH2/SH3 domains with external phosphotyrosine or proline-rich sequences—release these inhibitory constraints and promote full activation of the kinase. Physiological stimuli, including factors like heregulin (HRG) and IL-6, have been shown to promote ETK activation, particularly in the context of breast cancer cells, where ETK activation is linked to enhanced autophosphorylation and downstream signaling (bagheriyarmand2001etkbmxtyrosinekinase pages 3-4, chen2001regulationofthe pages 2-2, tsai2000etkabtk pages 1-2, corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 13-16).\n\nThe overall regulation of ETK involves a balance between kinase activation driven by phosphorylation events and inhibitory mechanisms that prevent excessive signaling. This dynamic equilibrium is essential for ensuring that ETK-mediated phosphorylation events occur only in response to appropriate extracellular signals, thereby maintaining normal cellular homeostasis (wen1999kinaseactivationof pages 6-7, wu2001proteolyticactivationof pages 1-1).\n\n7. Function  \nETK occupies a central role in the regulation of multiple cellular processes by transducing extracellular signals into intracellular responses. Expression of ETK has been detected in various cell types—ranging from epithelial and endothelial cells to hematopoietic cells—and it is known to be dynamically regulated during developmental processes such as mammary gland morphogenesis. ETK’s established function includes acting as an upstream activator of p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1), a serine/threonine kinase critical for orchestrating cytoskeletal rearrangements, cell motility, and anchorage-independent cell growth. In breast cancer cells, ETK-mediated phosphorylation of Pak1 has been directly linked to tumorigenic properties, as evidenced by experiments where kinase-inactive mutants of ETK lead to diminished Pak1 activity, reduced anchorage-independent growth, and impaired tumor formation in xenograft models (bagheriyarmand2001etkbmxtyrosinekinase pages 5-6, chen2001regulationofthe pages 2-2).\n\nIn addition to its role in Pak1 activation, ETK interacts with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) via its PH domain. This interaction effectively couples integrin-mediated cell adhesion to intracellular signaling pathways, regulating processes such as cell migration and morphological changes by modulating cytoskeletal organization. ETK’s activity is further implicated in signal transduction pathways triggered by growth factors and cytokines, including those mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which is known to be a critical upstream activator of ETK. In immune cell contexts, ETK also participates in propagating signals downstream of receptor engagement, thereby influencing cell survival, differentiation, and inflammatory responses (bagheriyarmand2001etkbmxtyrosinekinase pages 1-1, bagheriyarmand2001etkbmxtyrosinekinase pages 3-4, qiu1998etkbmxatyrosine pages 1-2, chen2001regulationofthe pages 2-2).\n\nExperimental evidence has established that ETK functions not only in the normal regulation of cell proliferation and migration but also contributes to oncogenic signaling. Aberrant activation or overexpression of ETK is associated with enhanced tumorigenic phenotypes, particularly in breast and prostate cancers, where ETK functions as a critical mediator linking extracellular cues to intracellular transformation processes. Moreover, in addition to Pak1, ETK appears to influence other signaling effectors through phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms, thereby modulating a broad array of cellular responses (bagheriyarmand2001etkbmxtyrosinekinase pages 1-1, bagheriyarmand2001etkbmxtyrosinekinase pages 5-6, qiu1998etkbmxatyrosine pages 3-4).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nETK is considered an attractive target for therapeutic intervention due to its integral role in mediating oncogenic signaling pathways and its impact on cellular processes such as migration, proliferation, and survival. Several small-molecule inhibitors have been explored to modulate ETK activity by targeting its ATP-binding pocket or exploiting allosteric sites that are unique to Tec family kinases. Although detailed inhibitor profiles for ETK are still under investigation, early studies have reported that inhibition of ETK activity leads to reduced tumor cell growth and impaired cell migration, suggesting potential benefits for treating cancers in which ETK signaling is dysregulated. In addition, alterations in the expression level or post-translational modifications of ETK have been linked to abnormal cell behavior, further supporting its candidacy as a drug target in pathological states such as breast cancer and inflammatory conditions (cenni2012bmxandits pages 6-7, tsai2000etkabtk pages 1-2, wen1999kinaseactivationof pages 6-7). No specific mutations have been universally reported in ETK that are directly associated with human disease; however, experimentally induced kinase-dead mutants and dominant-negative forms have provided significant insight into the kinase’s role in signal transduction and tumorigenicity. Continued research into the molecular mechanisms regulating ETK activity, including its upstream activators and downstream effectors, is expected to refine the understanding of its role in disease and to guide the development of more selective inhibitors (cenni2012bmxandits pages 6-7, tsai2000etkabtk pages 1-2).\n\n9.

Binding of antigen to the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) triggers signaling that ultimately leads to B-cell activation (PubMed:19290921). After BCR engagement and activation at the plasma membrane, phosphorylates PLCG2 at several sites, igniting the downstream signaling pathway through calcium mobilization, followed by activation of the protein kinase C (PKC) family members (PubMed:11606584). PLCG2 phosphorylation is performed in close cooperation with the adapter protein B-cell linker protein BLNK (PubMed:11606584). BTK acts as a platform to bring together a diverse array of signaling proteins and is implicated in cytokine receptor signaling pathways (PubMed:16517732, PubMed:17932028). Plays an important role in the function of immune cells of innate as well as adaptive immunity, as a component of the Toll-like receptors (TLR) pathway (PubMed:16517732). The TLR pathway acts as a primary surveillance system for the detection of pathogens and are crucial to the activation of host defense (PubMed:16517732). Especially, is a critical molecule in regulating TLR9 activation in splenic B-cells (PubMed:16517732, PubMed:17932028). Within the TLR pathway, induces tyrosine phosphorylation of TIRAP which leads to TIRAP degradation (PubMed:16415872). BTK also plays a critical role in transcription regulation (PubMed:19290921). Induces the activity of NF-kappa-B, which is involved in regulating the expression of hundreds of genes (PubMed:19290921). BTK is involved on the signaling pathway linking TLR8 and TLR9 to NF-kappa-B (PubMed:19290921). Acts as an activator of NLRP3 inflammasome assembly by mediating phosphorylation of NLRP3 (PubMed:34554188). Transiently phosphorylates transcription factor GTF2I on tyrosine residues in response to BCR (PubMed:9012831). GTF2I then translocates to the nucleus to bind regulatory enhancer elements to modulate gene expression (PubMed:9012831). ARID3A and NFAT are other transcriptional target of BTK (PubMed:16738337). BTK is required for the formation of functional ARID3A DNA-binding complexes (PubMed:16738337). There is however no evidence that BTK itself binds directly to DNA (PubMed:16738337). BTK has a dual role in the regulation of apoptosis (PubMed:9751072). Plays a role in STING1-mediated induction of type I interferon (IFN) response by phosphorylating DDX41 (PubMed:25704810)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase BTK belongs to the Tec family of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases, a subgroup that also includes related kinases such as ITK, TEC, TXK (also known as Rlk or BPK) and BMX. In vertebrates, BTK orthologs are widely conserved in species possessing a complex immune system, and its evolutionary history can be traced from lower metazoans to mammals. BTK’s inclusion in the Tec family is supported by its unique domain organization, which is distinct from other tyrosine kinase groups such as the Src or receptor tyrosine kinases. Its phylogenetic relationship with other members of the human kinome has been systematically analyzed and it is grouped together with kinases that emerged early during the evolution of eukaryotic signaling pathways (darragh2024comprehensivecharacterizationof pages 1-4, yu2009tecfamilykinases pages 23-26).  \n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nBTK catalyzes a phosphorylation reaction in which the terminal phosphate group of ATP is transferred to a tyrosine residue within substrate proteins. The chemical reaction can be summarized as follows:  \nATP + protein –OH → ADP + protein –O–P + H⁺.  \nIn this reaction, ATP provides the phosphate that is covalently attached to the hydroxyl group of a tyrosine residue in the target protein, thereby modifying its activity. (dinh2007activationmechanismand pages 1-2, darragh2024comprehensivecharacterizationof pages 1-4)\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of BTK is dependent on the presence of ATP as the phosphate donor and requires magnesium ions (Mg²⁺) as an essential cofactor. Mg²⁺ is generally required for proper coordination of ATP within the catalytic pocket, facilitating the transfer reaction. (dinh2007activationmechanismand pages 1-2, darragh2024comprehensivecharacterizationof pages 1-4)\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nBTK displays substrate specificity characteristic of tyrosine kinases. It preferentially phosphorylates tyrosine residues on substrates that participate in the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling cascade. Notably, BTK phosphorylates phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2) at multiple sites and acts in cooperation with the adapter protein BLNK, thus ensuring efficient propagation of downstream signals. In addition, substrates such as TIRAP are known targets in pathways triggered by Toll-like receptors, which underscores BTK’s critical role in both adaptive and innate immune responses. While the intrinsic substrate specificity in terms of consensus amino acid motifs has been the subject of extensive studies for tyrosine kinases, recent advances have identified that BTK substrates typically include flanking acidic residues and structural contexts that facilitate recognition by the kinase domain. (darragh2024comprehensivecharacterizationof pages 1-4, sonowal2023luxeptinibinterfereswith pages 14-15, vargas2013inhibitorsofbtk pages 3-6)\n\n5. Structure  \nThe structural organization of BTK is defined by a modular architecture consisting of five principal domains. At the N-terminus, BTK contains a Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domain that mediates membrane localization via interaction with phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) produced by PI3K. Adjacent to the PH domain is the Tec Homology (TH) domain, which is unique to Tec family kinases and includes regions such as a zinc-binding motif and a proline-rich region that contribute to protein stability and intra-molecular regulation. Following the TH domain are the SH3 and SH2 domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions by binding proline-rich sequences and phosphotyrosine motifs, respectively. These domains also participate in maintaining an autoinhibitory conformation in the resting state. At the C-terminus, the catalytic (kinase) domain is responsible for the enzymatic transfer of phosphate from ATP to a substrate tyrosine. Critical residues within this domain include the activation loop tyrosine (Tyr551), whose phosphorylation is necessary for full activation, and Tyr223 within the SH3 domain that, through autophosphorylation, modulates the overall catalytic efficiency. Importantly, the kinase domain also features a conserved cysteine residue (Cys481) that is targeted by covalent inhibitors such as ibrutinib, providing a structural basis for therapeutic intervention. High-resolution crystallographic studies and available structural models have detailed the positioning of the catalytic cleft, the hydrophobic spine, and the alignment of the C-helix, all of which are essential for proper kinase function. (darragh2024comprehensivecharacterizationof pages 1-4, lopezherrera2015bruton’styrosinekinase pages 1-4, marcotte2010structuresofhuman pages 1-3, lou2012bruton’styrosinekinase pages 1-2, kueffer2021reininginbtk pages 12-13)\n\n6. Regulation  \nBTK activity is regulated by multiple mechanisms that include post-translational modifications, interdomain interactions, and membrane recruitment. One primary mechanism of activation involves phosphorylation: initial phosphorylation of Tyr551 within the activation loop, often by Src family kinases such as Lyn, is followed by autophosphorylation at Tyr223 (located in the SH3 region), which contributes to a substantial increase in catalytic activity. These phosphorylation events induce conformational changes that shift BTK from an autoinhibited state to an active conformation. In addition, the binding of the PH domain to PIP3 at the plasma membrane is vital for recruiting BTK to the site of receptor signaling, thereby positioning it in proximity to its substrates. Furthermore, interactions with adaptor proteins such as BLNK reinforce the activation process by providing docking platforms that facilitate substrate recognition and subsequent phosphorylation. Allosteric regulation also plays a role; the interdomain contacts among the PH, TH, SH3, and SH2 domains help maintain the basal inactive state of BTK and are released upon appropriate stimuli. (darragh2024comprehensivecharacterizationof pages 1-4, dinh2007activationmechanismand pages 8-8, kueffer2021reininginbtk pages 11-12, kueffer2021reininginbtk pages 13-14)\n\n7. Function  \nBTK is indispensable for normal B lymphocyte development, differentiation, and signaling. In B cells, engagement of the B-cell receptor (BCR) triggers a signaling cascade in which BTK plays several roles. Following antigen binding and receptor clustering at the plasma membrane, BTK becomes activated by membrane recruitment through its PH domain binding to PIP3. Active BTK then phosphorylates key downstream effectors such as PLCγ2, which leads to the formation of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and subsequent calcium mobilization. This calcium flux is critical for further activation of protein kinase C (PKC) family members and the induction of transcription factors such as NF-κB, which ultimately regulate gene expression related to cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. Beyond its central role in BCR signaling, BTK is also involved in cytokine receptor signaling and Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways, highlighting its importance in both adaptive and innate immune responses. In the context of TLR signaling, BTK phosphorylates TIRAP, leading to its degradation and modulating the inflammatory response. BTK additionally contributes to the activation of transcription factors like GTF2I, ARID3A, and NFAT, affecting broader transcriptional programs. The dual roles of BTK in promoting survival signals and regulating apoptotic pathways underscore its functional complexity in immune cell biology. (darragh2024comprehensivecharacterizationof pages 1-4, dinh2007activationmechanismand pages 8-8, joseph2020differentialimpactof pages 1-2, kueffer2021reininginbtk pages 12-13)\n\n8. Other Comments  \nBTK is a well‐validated therapeutic target in B cell malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and a variety of autoimmune conditions. The clinical success of BTK inhibitors, notably the irreversible inhibitor ibrutinib, has highlighted the importance of Cys481 as a key binding site; however, resistance mutations such as C481S have been identified, prompting the development of next‐generation inhibitors that include reversible molecules (e.g., pirtobrutinib) and dual-mechanism agents designed to overcome such resistance. In addition, BTK inhibitors are now being explored in inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, as the enzyme plays an integral role in TLR signaling and cytokine production. Disease mutations in BTK, including loss-of-function mutations that cause X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), further exemplify the critical role of this kinase in immune homeostasis. Besides small-molecule inhibitors, combination therapeutic approaches and emerging modalities such as PROTAC degraders have been proposed to target BTK more effectively in cases where resistance may limit the efficacy of standard inhibitors.

Regulates the development, function and differentiation of conventional T-cells and nonconventional NKT-cells. When antigen presenting cells (APC) activate T-cell receptor (TCR), a series of phosphorylation lead to the recruitment of ITK to the cell membrane, in the vicinity of the stimulated TCR receptor, where it is phosphorylated by LCK. Phosphorylation leads to ITK autophosphorylation and full activation. Once activated, phosphorylates PLCG1, leading to the activation of this lipase and subsequent cleavage of its substrates. In turn, the endoplasmic reticulum releases calcium in the cytoplasm and the nuclear activator of activated T-cells (NFAT) translocates into the nucleus to perform its transcriptional duty. Phosphorylates 2 essential adapter proteins: the linker for activation of T-cells/LAT protein and LCP2. Then, a large number of signaling molecules such as VAV1 are recruited and ultimately lead to lymphokine production, T-cell proliferation and differentiation (PubMed:12186560, PubMed:12682224, PubMed:21725281). Required for TCR-mediated calcium response in gamma-delta T-cells, may also be involved in the modulation of the transcriptomic signature in the Vgamma2-positive subset of immature gamma-delta T-cells (By similarity). Phosphorylates TBX21 at 'Tyr-530' and mediates its interaction with GATA3 (By similarity)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‑protein kinase ITK is a member of the Tec family of non‑receptor tyrosine kinases that emerged early during metazoan evolution. Comparative phylogenetic analyses based on the complete human kinase complement indicate that the Tec family, including ITK along with Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), TEC, BMX, and TXK, share a common ancestral origin and are conserved broadly throughout vertebrate species (kwon2019tracingtheevolution pages 145-150, hunter2015theeukaryoticprotein pages 1-3). Orthologs of ITK have been identified in all mammalian species as well as in other jawed vertebrates. The strong sequence conservation within the catalytic kinase domain and the regulatory domains underscores ITK’s critical role in adaptive immunity, particularly in modulating T‑cell receptor (TCR) signaling (kwon2019tracingtheevolution pages 145-150, hunter2015theeukaryoticprotein pages 1-3). This evolutionary conservation places ITK within a highly conserved signaling network that is essential for immune cell function.\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nThe chemical reaction catalyzed by ITK is an ATP‑dependent phosphorylation of protein tyrosine residues. In this reaction, ITK binds ATP and transfers the gamma‑phosphate group onto the hydroxyl group of a substrate tyrosine residue, yielding ADP and a phospho-tyrosine protein product. The reaction can be represented as:  \nATP + [protein]‑L‑tyrosine → ADP + [protein]‑L‑tyrosine‑phosphate + H⁺ (kwon2019tracingtheevolution pages 23-28, andreotti2009conformationalsnapshotsof pages 8-9). This phosphorylation event is fundamental to the signal transduction cascade initiated by T‑cell receptors, where extracellular antigen recognition is transduced into a cascade of intracellular phosphorylation events that modulate various cellular effector functions.\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of ITK depends critically on the presence of divalent metal ions that serve to coordinate the ATP molecule within the active site. In vivo studies and biochemical assays have consistently shown that Mg²⁺ is the physiologically relevant cofactor required for efficient catalytic activity by ITK. Mg²⁺ interacts with ATP to properly orient its phosphate groups for transfer to the substrate (creeden2022pancreaticcancerkinome pages 27-28, kwon2019tracingtheevolution pages 32-37). Although under certain experimental conditions other divalent cations such as Mn²⁺ can sometimes substitute for Mg²⁺, the primary cofactor essential in T‑cell signaling contexts remains Mg²⁺.\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nITK displays substrate specificity that is determined by intrinsic catalytic preferences combined with recognition determinants common to Tec family kinases. High‑throughput peptide screening studies performed on the human tyrosine kinase family reveal that these kinases preferentially phosphorylate substrates in which the target tyrosine residue is flanked by hydrophobic or basic amino acid residues. Specifically, analyses of intrinsic substrate specificity have found that substrates preferred by tyrosine kinases contain local sequence motifs that promote efficient docking and phosphorylation (yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 1-2, yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 7-8). In the context of T‑cell receptor signaling, the primary substrates of ITK include phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLCG1), the transmembrane adapter protein LAT (linker for activation of T‑cells), and the cytosolic adapter LCP2 (also known as SLP‑76). In addition, ITK phosphorylates the transcription factor TBX21 (T‑bet) at Tyr‑530, a modification that influences its interaction with other transcriptional regulators such as GATA3 (yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 1-2, yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 7-8, oruganty2016identificationandclassification pages 12-13). Although no single consensus phosphorylation motif for ITK has been universally defined, the local amino acid environment surrounding the phosphoacceptor tyrosine is typically enriched in hydrophobic and/or basic residues that facilitate substrate binding and efficient catalysis by ITK.\n\n5. Structure  \nThe three‑dimensional structure of ITK is defined by a modular arrangement of distinct functional domains, a hallmark of Tec family kinases. At the extreme N‑terminus of ITK is a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain whose primary function is binding phosphoinositide lipids such as phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5‑trisphosphate (PIP₃). This binding event is crucial for the recruitment of ITK to the plasma membrane during T‑cell receptor activation (boyken2013molecularregulationof pages 22-26, kwon2019tracingtheevolution pages 28-32). Following the PH domain, ITK contains a Tec homology (TH) domain. The TH domain often encompasses a proline‑rich region (PRR) that is essential for facilitating both intramolecular and intermolecular protein–protein interactions required for proper kinase regulation (boyken2013molecularregulationof pages 17-22, andreotti2018multidomaincontrolover pages 29-30). Downstream of the TH domain are the Src homology domains: the SH3 domain, which interacts primarily with proline‑rich sequences, and the SH2 domain, which specifically recognizes phosphorylated tyrosine residues on partner proteins (boyken2013molecularregulationof pages 22-26, brown2006crystalstructuresand pages 16-19).  \nThe C‑terminal portion of ITK consists of the catalytic kinase domain (or SH1 domain), which adopts a classical bilobed architecture. The N‑lobe of the kinase domain consists primarily of beta sheets while the C‑lobe is largely helical. Within this catalytic domain, several key regulatory features are observed. The activation loop (often termed the A‑loop) contains tyrosine residues that must be phosphorylated for full activation. A conserved hydrophobic spine is present and contributes to the structural integrity and active conformation of the kinase. Additionally, the C‑helix is well‑positioned to organize the ATP‑binding pocket, ensuring the proper orientation of catalytic residues (kwon2019tracingtheevolution pages 28-32, kwon2019tracingtheevolution pages 32-37, boyken2013molecularregulationof pages 22-26, brown2006crystalstructuresand pages 16-19). These structural elements, which are supported both by crystallographic studies of related Tec family kinases and by AlphaFold model predictions, provide the mechanistic basis for ITK's enzymatic activity and its regulation.\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of ITK is achieved through multiple layers involving membrane localization, phosphorylation events by upstream kinases, and intramolecular interactions among its regulatory domains. Upon recognition of antigen by the T‑cell receptor complex, the activation of phosphoinositide‑3‑kinase (PI3K) leads to the production of PIP₃ at the plasma membrane. The PH domain of ITK binds PIP₃, thereby recruiting ITK to the vicinity of the activated TCR complex (hunter2015theeukaryoticprotein pages 3-6, creeden2022pancreaticcancerkinome pages 27-28).  \nOnce ITK is localized at the plasma membrane, it is phosphorylated by the Src family kinase LCK on a critical tyrosine residue located in the activation loop, typically designated as Y511 in ITK. This phosphorylation event is a prerequisite for ITK autophosphorylation, which further amplifies its catalytic activity (joseph2011controllingtheactivity pages 8-9, andreotti2009conformationalsnapshotsof pages 8-9). Furthermore, ITK is subject to autoinhibitory regulation wherein its SH3 and SH2 domains interact with intramolecular sequences to stabilize a low‐activity, autoinhibited conformation under resting conditions (hussain2013studiesonitksyk pages 44-48, boyken2013molecularregulationof pages 71-76). Disruption of these autoinhibitory contacts—either by phosphorylation‐induced conformational changes or by binding of adapter proteins—relieves the inhibition. This conformational change allows repositioning of key structural elements, including the N‑lobe and the C‑helix in the kinase domain, thereby permitting efficient substrate binding and catalytic activity (andreotti2009conformationalsnapshotsof pages 8-9, amatya2019dynamicregulatoryfeatures pages 14-15, joseph2011controllingtheactivity pages 8-9). Collectively, this finely tuned multi‑layered regulatory mechanism ensures that ITK is activated exclusively in response to T‑cell receptor engagement, thus preventing inappropriate activation under basal conditions (hussain2013studiesonitksyk pages 44-48, lechner2020roleofthe pages 7-8).\n\n7. Function  \nITK plays a central role in T‑cell receptor signaling and the consequent regulation of adaptive immune responses. Its expression is predominantly restricted to T‑cells, including conventional T‑cells, natural killer T (NKT) cells, and subsets of gamma‑delta T cells. Upon T‑cell receptor engagement during antigen recognition, ITK is recruited to the plasma membrane via its PH domain binding to PIP₃, where it undergoes activation through phosphorylation by LCK (hunter2015theeukaryoticprotein pages 1-3, creeden2022pancreaticcancerkinome pages 27-28).  \nOnce activated, ITK phosphorylates several key substrates critical for propagating the T‑cell activation signal. The foremost substrate is phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLCG1), whose phosphorylation triggers the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5‑bisphosphate (PIP₂) into inositol 1,4,5‑trisphosphate (IP₃) and diacylglycerol (DAG) (creeden2022pancreaticcancerkinome pages 27-28, hauck2013primarytcella pages 36-39). This reaction leads to the release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum and the activation of protein kinase C (PKC), events that ultimately culminate in the nuclear translocation of NFAT and the initiation of cytokine gene transcription.  \nIn parallel to its effect on PLCG1, ITK phosphorylates adapter proteins such as LAT and LCP2 (SLP‑76). These phosphorylation events promote the assembly of multiprotein signalosomes that include additional downstream effectors such as VAV1, which further relay signals leading to T‑cell proliferation, differentiation, and cytokine production (creeden2022pancreaticcancerkinome pages 27-28, lechner2020roleofthe pages 7-8). In addition, the phosphorylation of the transcription factor TBX21 (T‑bet) at Tyr‑530 by ITK affects its interaction with other transcriptional regulators like GATA3, thereby modulating T‑helper cell differentiation and lineage decisions (yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 7-8, lechner2020roleofthe pages 7-8). Through these coordinated phosphorylation events, ITK functions as an essential mediator in T‑cell activation, integrating signals from the T‑cell receptor and co‑stimulatory receptors to regulate adaptive immune responses (creeden2022pancreaticcancerkinome pages 27-28, hunter2015theeukaryoticprotein pages 1-3).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nOwing to its central role in mediating T‑cell receptor signaling and adaptive immune responses, ITK represents an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in various immune‑related disorders. Dysregulated ITK activity—whether through gain or loss of function—has been implicated in immunodeficiency syndromes, aberrant T‑cell responses, and lymphoproliferative disorders. Several small molecule inhibitors that target ITK either through competitive binding at the ATP‑binding site or allosteric modulation by stabilizing the autoinhibited conformation are under preclinical investigation, and some have advanced into early clinical trials for conditions including autoimmune diseases and T‑cell malignancies (mamand2018characterisinginterleukin2induciblekinase pages 38-41, han2014selectivelytargetingan pages 19-20). In addition, research continues to identify disease‑associated mutations in both the regulatory and catalytic domains of ITK, further clarifying the linkage between ITK dysfunction and pathogenic T‑cell responses (hussain2013studiesonitksyk pages 44-48, lechner2020roleofthe pages 8-9). The unique integration of membrane recruitment via the PH domain and intramolecular regulation by the SH3 and SH2 domains provides a promising framework for the design of allosteric inhibitors with improved specificity and reduced off‑target effects. These structural insights not only inform drug discovery efforts but also help in understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of ITK’s role in immune cell signaling.\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny – TEC is a member of the Tec family kinases, a subgroup of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases that also includes Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK), interleukin‐2–inducible T‐cell kinase (ITK), bone marrow tyrosine kinase on chromosome X (BMX) and Txk. TEC and its paralogs are evolutionarily conserved in metazoans and can be traced back to early premetazoan origins, as illustrated in the molecular phylogenetic classifications described by Manning et al. in studies of the human kinase complement (andreotti2018multidomaincontrolover pages 10-11, nawaz2013influenceonthe pages 45-48). TEC is widely expressed in hematopoietic cells and contributes to signaling in lymphoid as well as myeloid cell types, placing it in a core evolutionary group of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases that share modular domains including PH, Tec homology, SH3, SH2 and kinase domains (andreotti2018multidomaincontrolover pages 1-3, raussendorf2017aswitchin pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed – TEC catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to a tyrosine residue on specific substrate proteins. The overall reaction can be summarized as follows:  \n  ATP + [protein]-(L-tyrosine) → ADP + [protein]-L-tyrosine-phosphate + H⁺ (andreotti2018multidomaincontrolover pages 24-26, joseph2010identificationofan pages 15-16).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements – The catalytic activity of TEC depends on the presence of divalent cations, with Mg²⁺ being the essential cofactor required for efficient ATP binding and phosphoryl transfer (andreotti2018multidomaincontrolover pages 24-26).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity – Detailed characterization of the intrinsic substrate specificity for tyrosine kinases has been performed using combinatorial peptide arrays and positional scanning approaches. TEC exhibits a distinctive phosphorylation motif, which has been defined in comprehensive substrate specificity studies of the human tyrosine kinome. According to Yaron-Barir et al. (2024), TEC recognizes substrate motifs with defined amino acid preferences surrounding the phosphoacceptor tyrosine; such studies typically profile preferences over positions −5 to +5 relative to the tyrosine residue (yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 1-2, yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 7-8). In addition, specific priming dependencies and context‐dependent phosphorylation patterns have been observed, such that TEC phosphorylates substrates involved in T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling, B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling and integrin-mediated pathways. Furthermore, the intrinsic substrate specificity data suggest that TEC shares general features with other tyrosine kinases while maintaining distinct preferences that contribute to its selective engagement with substrates like DOK1, STAP1, GRB10 and FGF2 among others (yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 16-16).\n\n5. Structure – TEC is a modular multi-domain enzyme that comprises an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a Tec homology (TH) domain often referred to as the “Btk homology” region containing a zinc-binding motif and proline-rich regions, followed by SH3 and SH2 domains and a C-terminal catalytic kinase domain. The PH domain is primarily responsible for binding phosphoinositides such as PIP₃, which targets TEC to the plasma membrane upon receptor activation (andreotti2018multidomaincontrolover pages 10-11, august2012regulationoftcell pages 1-3). The SH3 domain typically engages in intramolecular interactions with proline-rich sequences in linker regions, thereby stabilizing an autoinhibited conformation, and the SH2 domain recognizes phosphorylated tyrosine residues on adaptor proteins which further control subcellular localization and activation. The kinase domain adopts a conserved bilobal structure common to other tyrosine kinases with a regulatory “activation loop” whose phosphorylation is crucial for attaining the active conformation. Key structural features include an assembly of a regulatory hydrophobic spine that spans both the N-terminal and C-terminal lobes and a C-helix whose proper orientation is essential for catalytic activity; these elements are functionally similar to those described in Src-related kinases, albeit modulated via additional domains unique to the Tec family (andreotti2018multidomaincontrolover pages 13-15, joseph2010identificationofan pages 6-8, horwood2012tecfamilykinases pages 2-5). Moreover, the overall 3D organization of TEC is predicted by computational modeling and supported by fragmentary crystallographic studies of its related family members, which collectively exhibit a compact, autoinhibited configuration that undergoes multi-domain rearrangements upon activation (andreotti2018multidomaincontrolover pages 15-17, andreotti2018multidomaincontrolover pages 8-10).\n\n6. Regulation – TEC is regulated by a complex network of intramolecular and intermolecular interactions that ensure its activity is tightly controlled in response to extracellular signals. In resting lymphocytes, TEC is maintained in an autoinhibited state where interactions between its SH3, SH2, and catalytic domains restrict its enzymatic activity. This autoinhibition is released upon receptor engagement, which leads to membrane recruitment via the PH domain binding to PIP₃ generated by PI3 kinase. Upstream kinases, notably those of the Src family such as Lck, phosphorylate specific tyrosine residues in the activation loop, thereby promoting a conformational switch that completes the assembly of the regulatory hydrophobic spine and reorients the C-helix into an active configuration (andreotti2018multidomaincontrolover pages 26-28, andreotti2018multidomaincontrolover pages 17-18). Further modulation is achieved through the binding of adaptor proteins such as SLP-76 and CD28, which interact with the SH2 and SH3 domains to augment substrate docking and kinase activity, particularly in T-cell receptor signaling cascades (andreotti2018multidomaincontrolover pages 28-29, andreotti2018multidomaincontrolover pages 3-4). Mutagenesis studies have shown that alterations in key residues within the regulatory spine or gatekeeper regions, as well as mutations in the SH2-kinase linker, profoundly affect catalytic turnover, underscoring the role of allosteric regulation through precise intradomain contacts (joseph2011controllingtheactivity pages 1-2, joseph2011controllingtheactivity pages 7-8, raussendorf2017aswitchin pages 1-2).\n\n7. Function – TEC functions as a signal transducer downstream of multiple receptor types. In T cells, TEC contributes to T-cell receptor–dependent activation, mediating the phosphorylation events that lead to IL2 gene induction and the regulation of both conventional T-cell and nonconventional natural killer T-cell differentiation; TEC functions in a redundant manner with ITK in these pathways (andreotti2018multidomaincontrolover pages 1-3, august2012regulationoftcell pages 6-8). In B cells, TEC plays roles that are partially redundant with BTK in B-cell receptor signaling, where it phosphorylates substrates such as STAP1 that contribute to B-cell development and activation (nawaz2013influenceonthe pages 45-48, andreotti2018multidomaincontrolover pages 28-29). In mast cells, TEC is required for efficient cytokine production and participates in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which is critical for cell migration and degranulation. TEC also participates in signaling pathways in myeloid cells downstream of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (CSF3), thereby influencing both growth and differentiation. In platelets, TEC contributes to integrin-mediated signal transduction leading to platelet activation. Furthermore, TEC has roles in hepatocyte proliferation and liver regeneration by modulating hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-induced ERK signaling and it regulates fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) unconventional secretion through phosphorylation of FGF2 on Tyr-215. In other paradigms, TEC cooperates with JAK2 in a reciprocal phosphorylation mechanism that mediates cytokine-driven activation of FOS transcription, with GRB10 serving as a substrate that modulates signaling feedback (andreotti2018multidomaincontrolover pages 28-29, nawaz2013influenceonthe pages 45-48).\n\n8. Other Comments – Although potent inhibitors have been developed for related Tec family kinases such as BTK and ITK, specific inhibitors targeting TEC remain less well characterized. Preclinical investigations have focused on covalent inhibition strategies that target reactive cysteine residues in the ATP binding pocket—a mechanism that has been successfully exploited in the development of BTK inhibitors such as ibrutinib (forster2020discoveryofa pages 1-3, horwood2012tecfamilykinases pages 11-13). TEC’s involvement in diverse signaling pathways that govern both adaptive and innate immune responses, as well as its roles in platelet activation, hepatocyte proliferation and osteoclast differentiation, suggest that dysregulation of TEC activity could contribute to disorders ranging from immunodeficiencies to cancer and inflammatory diseases. Notable disease associations include its potential involvement in aberrant TCR and BCR signaling when TEC expression or activity is altered (andreotti2018multidomaincontrolover pages 26-28, nawaz2013influenceonthe pages 45-48). At present, experiments using mutation analysis and domain-deletion studies have provided a mechanistic framework for TEC regulation, but clinical-grade chemical probes selective for TEC are under active investigation (andreotti2018multidomaincontrolover pages 29-30).\n\n9.

Regulates the development, function and differentiation of conventional T-cells and nonconventional NKT-cells. When antigen presenting cells (APC) activate T-cell receptor (TCR), a series of phosphorylation leads to the recruitment of TXK to the cell membrane, where it is phosphorylated at Tyr-420. Phosphorylation leads to TXK full activation. Also contributes to signaling from many receptors and participates in multiple downstream pathways, including regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Like ITK, can phosphorylate PLCG1, leading to its localization in lipid rafts and activation, followed by subsequent cleavage of its substrates. In turn, the endoplasmic reticulum releases calcium in the cytoplasm and the nuclear activator of activated T-cells (NFAT) translocates into the nucleus to perform its transcriptional duty. Plays a role in the positive regulation of IFNG transcription in T-helper 1 cells as part of an IFNG promoter-binding complex with PARP1 and EEF1A1 (PubMed:11859127, PubMed:17177976). Within the complex, phosphorylates both PARP1 and EEF1A1 (PubMed:17177976). Also phosphorylates key sites in LCP2 leading to the up-regulation of Th1 preferred cytokine IL-2. Phosphorylates 'Tyr-201' of CTLA4 which leads to the association of PI-3 kinase with the CTLA4 receptor**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase TXK (gene TXK, also known as PTK4 or RLK) is a member of the Tec family of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases. The Tec family groups together several lymphocyte‐expressed kinases including ITK, Btk, Tec, and Bmx, with TXK being the variant predominantly expressed in T cells. Unlike its relatives that carry an N‐terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, TXK is characterized by a distinct N‐terminal cysteine‐rich motif that is targetable for palmitoylation, a modification that contributes to its membrane association. TXK orthologs have been identified across mammalian species, and the Tec family itself can be traced back to early eukaryotic evolution. Its membership within the human kinome is also defined by the overall conserved structure of catalytic, SH3, and SH2 domains that TXK shares with the Tec family; however, the lack of the PH domain in TXK represents a divergence from the more canonical domain architecture seen in other family members. The protein kinase complement of the human genome has been extensively catalogued, and based on the evolutionary studies reported by Manning et al. (2002) regarding the protein kinase complement and evolution from yeast to man, TXK fits within a branch of kinases that diversified early during eukaryotic evolution and have acquired specialized functions in regulating adaptive immunity (berg2005tecfamilykinases pages 1-3, smith2001thetecfamily pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nTXK catalyzes the transfer of the gamma-phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of tyrosine residues present on substrate proteins. The general reaction follows the ATP-dependent phosphorylation mechanism that is common to all tyrosine kinases:  \n  ATP + [protein]-tyrosine → ADP + [protein]-phosphotyrosine + H⁺  \nThis reaction creates a phosphotyrosine residue that acts as a docking site for SH2 domain-containing signaling proteins, thereby propagating intracellular signaling cascades (berg2005tecfamilykinases pages 39-41, bolen1997leukocyteproteintyrosine pages 6-9).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of TXK, like that of other tyrosine kinases, is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ion cofactors. In particular, Mg²⁺ is required to coordinate ATP binding and facilitate the transfer of the phosphate group to the substrate (bolen1997leukocyteproteintyrosine pages 6-9, tsygankov2003nonreceptorproteintyrosine pages 1-3).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nTXK exhibits substrate specificity typical of tyrosine kinases, meaning that it preferentially phosphorylates tyrosine residues within specific sequence contexts. Recent advances in the intrinsic substrate specificity of the human tyrosine kinome have provided detailed motif profiles for tyrosine kinases; although TXK’s precise motif has not been exhaustively detailed in every report, studies using positional scanning techniques indicate that kinases in the Tec family, which include TXK, show characteristic preferences for amino acids surrounding the target tyrosine. TXK is known to phosphorylate substrates such as phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLCG1), leading to its localization in lipid rafts; it also phosphorylates specific sites in adaptor proteins like LCP2 and CTLA4 (berg2005tecfamilykinases pages 39-41, yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 1-2, yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 19-22). Detailed quantitative analyses using peptide library platforms have begun to define the optimal recognition motifs for tyrosine kinases, and TXK is expected to conform to a substrate recognition pattern that allows it to function in many downstream signaling pathways. The consensus substrate motif is influenced by the surrounding charge and hydrophobicity, which in turn modulates the binding of the kinase catalytic domain to its substrate (yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 7-8).\n\n5. Structure  \nTXK comprises several discrete domains that are conserved among Tec family kinases, albeit with some unique adaptations. The primary domain organization of TXK includes:  \n • A unique N-terminal region containing a cysteine-rich motif instead of the conventional pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. This cysteine string is palmitoylated, which mediates TXK’s membrane association and may contribute to its specific subcellular localization;  \n • An SH3 (Src Homology 3) domain that mediates protein–protein interactions by binding to proline-rich sequences, thereby facilitating both intermolecular and intramolecular regulatory interactions;  \n • An SH2 (Src Homology 2) domain responsible for binding to phosphorylated tyrosine motifs on target proteins, which is essential for signal propagation and the assembly of larger signaling complexes;  \n • A C-terminal kinase catalytic (SH1) domain that contains the active site responsible for the ATP-dependent phosphorylation reaction. This domain includes features common to protein kinases, such as an activation loop (T-loop), a hydrophobic spine, and a conserved C-helix that are critical for catalytic activity and regulation.  \nStructural studies and models (including those derived from AlphaFold predictions) reinforce that while TXK shares the overall structural fold seen in other Tec family kinases, its initial domain is divergent in that it does not include the canonical PH domain. This divergence has implications for its regulation and localization (smith2001thetecfamily pages 1-2, yang2000teckinasesa pages 6-7, tsygankov2003nonreceptorproteintyrosine pages 7-8).\n\n6. Regulation  \nTXK is regulated by several post-translational modifications and protein–protein interactions that control its localization and kinase activity. A key regulatory event is the phosphorylation of TXK at Tyr-420 upon T-cell receptor (TCR) engagement. This phosphorylation event is critical for full kinase activation and is typically triggered following the recruitment of TXK to the cell membrane; the membrane recruitment is mediated by the palmitoylation of its unique cysteine-rich motif (berg2005tecfamilykinases pages 39-41, mamand2018characterisinginterleukin2induciblekinase pages 35-38).  \nAdditional regulatory modifications involve TXK’s interactions within multiprotein complexes. For instance, TXK participates in a promoter-binding complex with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) and elongation factor 1-alpha (EEF1A1) in T-helper 1 cells, wherein it phosphorylates both PARP1 and EEF1A1; this event is associated with the positive regulation of interferon-γ (IFNG) transcription (berg2005tecfamilykinases pages 17-18, mihara2007roleoftxk pages 1-4). Moreover, TXK phosphorylates key sites in LCP2, leading to the up-regulation of interleukin-2 (IL-2) production in T cells, and it phosphorylates Tyr-201 on CTLA4, which facilitates the recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) to the receptor. These phosphorylation events serve to regulate downstream signaling cascades essential for T cell activation and cytokine production. The coordinated interplay of phosphorylation at specific tyrosine residues, membrane localization via palmitoylation, and interactions through its SH2 and SH3 domains underlies TXK’s activation state (berg2005tecfamilykinases pages 39-41, mihara2007roleoftxk pages 1-4, andreotti2018multidomaincontrolover pages 29-30).\n\n7. Function  \nTXK functions as a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a redundant role with interleukin-2-inducible T-cell kinase (ITK) in regulating the adaptive immune response. TXK is predominantly expressed in T lymphocytes, including both conventional T cells and nonconventional natural killer T (NKT) cells. Upon activation of the T-cell receptor (TCR) by antigen-presenting cells, a cascade of phosphorylation events is initiated that results in the recruitment of TXK to the cell membrane and subsequent phosphorylation at Tyr-420, leading to TXK full activation. Once activated, TXK phosphorylates key substrates such as phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLCG1). The phosphorylation of PLCG1 promotes its localization in lipid rafts where it becomes activated, leading to the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol trisphosphate (IP3). The resultant IP3 induces the release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum, while DAG contributes to the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and ultimately the nuclear translocation of the Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells (NFAT). Through these events, TXK contributes to the transcriptional activation of downstream genes such as IFNG in T-helper 1 (Th1) cells. Within the IFNG promoter-binding complex, TXK phosphorylates both PARP1 and elongation factor 1-alpha (EEF1A1), thereby modulating the positive regulation of IFNG transcription (berg2005tecfamilykinases pages 17-18, mamand2018characterisinginterleukin2induciblekinase pages 32-35). In addition, TXK phosphorylates signaling molecules such as LCP2, leading to the increased expression of IL-2, a key cytokine in T-cell proliferation and function, and phosphorylates CTLA4 on Tyr-201 to promote PI3K association, contributing to the modulation of inhibitory signaling pathways. These functions place TXK within the central network of T-cell receptor mediated signaling pathways, downstream of early kinases such as Lck and ZAP-70, and upstream of transcriptional and cytokine responses critical for adaptive immunity (berg2005tecfamilykinases pages 39-41, mamand2018characterisinginterleukin2induciblekinase pages 32-35, mihara2007roleoftxk pages 1-4).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nTXK is currently recognized as an immunoregulatory kinase and a potential therapeutic target in conditions involving dysregulated T-cell responses. Inhibitors targeting kinases of the Tec family, such as PRN694, have been developed and are under investigation for their ability to modulate T-cell activity in autoimmune diseases and cancer, although specific inhibitors for TXK remain less characterized relative to ITK (andreotti2018multidomaincontrolover pages 29-30). Disease associations for TXK involve its role in the positive regulation of interferon-γ transcription and IL-2 production in Th1 cells; aberrant TXK activity may contribute to inappropriate immune responses in autoimmune or inflammatory diseases. Additionally, because TXK phosphorylates CTLA4, its activity potentially influences immune checkpoint regulation. Although TXK has been shown to act redundantly with ITK, its unique domain architecture—especially the replacement of the PH domain with a palmitoylatable cysteine-rich motif—may provide opportunities for the development of more selective modulators. Current research continues to clarify TXK’s substrate specificity through high-resolution phosphoproteomic approaches, as exemplified in recent studies mapping the intrinsic substrate preferences of human tyrosine kinases (yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 1-2, yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 2-3). In summary, TXK is of significant interest in the context of T-cell signaling and immune modulation, with ongoing research required to further delineate its precise biochemical properties, inhibitor sensitivities, and clinical relevance (siveen2018roleofnon pages 17-18, yang2000teckinasesa pages 6-7).\n\n9.

Coordinates actin remodeling through tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins controlling cytoskeleton dynamics like WASF3 (involved in branch formation); ANXA1 (involved in membrane anchoring); DBN1, DBNL, CTTN, RAPH1 and ENAH (involved in signaling); or MAPT and PXN (microtubule-binding proteins). Phosphorylation of WASF3 is critical for the stimulation of lamellipodia formation and cell migration. Involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and motility through phosphorylation of key regulators of these processes such as BCAR1, CRK, CRKL, DOK1, EFS or NEDD9 (PubMed:22810897). Phosphorylates multiple receptor tyrosine kinases and more particularly promotes endocytosis of EGFR, facilitates the formation of neuromuscular synapses through MUSK, inhibits PDGFRB-mediated chemotaxis and modulates the endocytosis of activated B-cell receptor complexes. Other substrates which are involved in endocytosis regulation are the caveolin (CAV1) and RIN1. Moreover, ABL1 regulates the CBL family of ubiquitin ligases that drive receptor down-regulation and actin remodeling. Phosphorylation of CBL leads to increased EGFR stability. Involved in late-stage autophagy by regulating positively the trafficking and function of lysosomal components. ABL1 targets to mitochondria in response to oxidative stress and thereby mediates mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. In response to oxidative stress, phosphorylates serine/threonine kinase PRKD2 at 'Tyr-717' (PubMed:28428613). ABL1 is also translocated in the nucleus where it has DNA-binding activity and is involved in DNA-damage response and apoptosis. Many substrates are known mediators of DNA repair: DDB1, DDB2, ERCC3, ERCC6, RAD9A, RAD51, RAD52 or WRN. Activates the proapoptotic pathway when the DNA damage is too severe to be repaired. Phosphorylates TP73, a primary regulator for this type of damage-induced apoptosis. Phosphorylates the caspase CASP9 on 'Tyr-153' and regulates its processing in the apoptotic response to DNA damage. Phosphorylates PSMA7 that leads to an inhibition of proteasomal activity and cell cycle transition blocks. ABL1 also acts as a regulator of multiple pathological signaling cascades during infection. Several known tyrosine-phosphorylated microbial proteins have been identified as ABL1 substrates. This is the case of A36R of Vaccinia virus, Tir (translocated intimin receptor) of pathogenic E.coli and possibly Citrobacter, CagA (cytotoxin-associated gene A) of H.pylori, or AnkA (ankyrin repeat-containing protein A) of A.phagocytophilum. Pathogens can highjack ABL1 kinase signaling to reorganize the host actin cytoskeleton for multiple purposes, like facilitating intracellular movement and host cell exit. Finally, functions as its own regulator through autocatalytic activity as well as through phosphorylation of its inhibitor, ABI1. Regulates T-cell differentiation in a TBX21-dependent manner (By similarity). Positively regulates chemokine-mediated T-cell migration, polarization, and homing to lymph nodes and immune-challenged tissues, potentially via activation of NEDD9/HEF1 and RAP1 (By similarity). Phosphorylates TBX21 on tyrosine residues leading to an enhancement of its transcriptional activator activity (By similarity)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase ABL1 is a member of the Abl family of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases that is evolutionarily conserved from invertebrates to vertebrates, with homologs identifiable in organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans before a gene duplication event in vertebrates produced the paralogs ABL1 and ABL2 (colicelli2010abltyrosinekinases pages 1-2, greuber2013roleofabl pages 1-2). Comparative genomic studies have placed ABL1 within the core kinome as defined by systematic analyses of the human protein kinase complement, and it is grouped within the Src-related kinase family based on its conserved SH3–SH2–kinase domain cassette (colicelli2010abltyrosinekinases pages 2-4, greuber2013roleofabl pages 2-4). Phylogenetic reconstruction based on the catalytic and regulatory domains indicates that ABL1’s central module has maintained a highly conserved structure over evolutionary time, with the divergence of its regulatory and substrate recognition motifs further refining its specialized roles in higher eukaryotes (colicelli2010abltyrosinekinases pages 27-36, hantschel2012structureregulationsignaling pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nABL1 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of tyrosine residues on substrate proteins. The general reaction can be written as: ATP + protein (tyrosine) → ADP + protein (phosphotyrosine) + H⁺ (colicelli2010abltyrosinekinases pages 5-7, arrington2019identificationofthe pages 10-11).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of ABL1 is dependent on the binding of ATP and requires divalent metal ions, most notably Mg²⁺, to coordinate the phosphates of ATP during catalysis (cao2008enhancementofabl pages 1-2, irgit2025structureanddynamics pages 1-3).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nStudies using kinase assay linked phosphoproteomics and subsequent motif analysis have demonstrated that ABL1 exhibits a substrate preference characterized by specific amino acid residues flanking the phosphorylated tyrosine. In vitro experiments indicate that ABL1 preferentially phosphorylates substrates that display an acidic residue at positions upstream of the target tyrosine and typically a hydrophobic residue, such as proline or phenylalanine, at the +3 position relative to the phosphorylated site (arrington2019identificationofthe pages 5-6, arrington2019identificationofthe pages 7-8). Sequence motif analyses performed with tools like WebLogo and motif-x confirm that the consensus phosphorylation motif of ABL1 is consistent with earlier studies and is enriched for residues that facilitate efficient substrate recognition by its SH2 domain, thereby enabling processive phosphorylation (arrington2019identificationofthe pages 8-9, colicelli2010abltyrosinekinases pages 5-7). Furthermore, recent delineation of human tyrosine kinase substrate specificities supports the notion that ABL1 recognizes a motif with particular sequence constraints, although specific consensus motifs for tyrosine kinases have also been reported in the literature (manley2020thespecificityof pages 1-6).\n\n5. Structure  \nABL1 exhibits a multidomain organization that is central to its catalytic function and regulatory control. The protein is composed of an N-terminal cap region that, in one of its major isoforms (ABL1b), is myristoylated, a modification that plays an essential role in autoinhibition by docking into a hydrophobic pocket within the kinase domain; this N-terminal difference distinguishes isoforms such as 1a (non-myristoylated) from 1b (irgit2025structureanddynamics pages 5-6, hantschel2012structureregulationsignaling pages 2-3). Following the cap, ABL1 contains an SH3 domain that binds proline-rich motifs, and an SH2 domain that selectively interacts with phosphotyrosine-containing sequences; these two domains function cooperatively to mediate intramolecular interactions that stabilize the kinase in its inactive conformation (colicelli2010abltyrosinekinases pages 1-2, colicelli2010abltyrosinekinases pages 4-5). The central catalytic (SH1) domain has a bilobal structure with a smaller N-terminal lobe that includes a glycine-rich phosphate-binding P-loop and an αC helix that is critical for orienting key catalytic residues, and a larger C-terminal lobe largely responsible for substrate binding (irgit2025structureanddynamics pages 1-3, colicelli2010abltyrosinekinases pages 8-10). A prominent structural feature is the activation loop (A-loop), which undergoes autophosphorylation at tyrosine 412 and shifts from a closed (inactive) to an open (active) conformation to allow substrate access to the catalytic site (colicelli2010abltyrosinekinases pages 10-12, colicelli2010abltyrosinekinases pages 15-16). In addition, ABL1 contains a long C-terminal tail that harbors nuclear localization signals, actin-binding domains, and other protein-protein interaction motifs that are implicated in cytoskeletal regulation and nuclear functions (colicelli2010abltyrosinekinases pages 17-19, irgit2025structureanddynamics pages 3-4).\n\n6. Regulation  \nABL1 is subject to complex regulation that involves multiple layers of post-translational modifications and conformational control. Autoinhibition of ABL1 is achieved through intramolecular interactions whereby the SH3 domain is tethered to the SH2-kinase linker, and in the 1b isoform, the N-terminal myristoyl group is inserted into a pocket in the C-lobe of the kinase domain, maintaining the kinase in an inactive state (hantschel2012structureregulationsignaling pages 4-5, colicelli2010abltyrosinekinases pages 2-4). Activation of ABL1 occurs when these inhibitory constraints are disrupted, either via phosphorylation of key residues – notably autophosphorylation at tyrosine 412 in the activation loop – or through the binding of regulatory proteins that alter the domain interactions (colicelli2010abltyrosinekinases pages 10-12, colicelli2010abltyrosinekinases pages 13-15). Additional phosphorylation events at residues outside the activation loop, such as tyrosines within the SH2-kinase linker, further modulate its activity, while phosphorylation of inhibitor proteins like ABI1 can also impact its catalytic function through feedback mechanisms (arrington2019identificationofthe pages 6-7, colicelli2010abltyrosinekinases pages 16-17). Beyond phosphorylation, ABL1 is regulated by ubiquitination mediated by E3 ligases, and its subcellular localization is tightly controlled by the presence of nuclear localization signals (NLS) and nuclear export signals (colicelli2010abltyrosinekinases pages 19-20, irgit2025structureanddynamics pages 3-4). The interplay of these regulatory modifications ensures that ABL1 activity is precisely coordinated in response to extracellular stimuli and intracellular signals (greuber2013roleofabl pages 15-16, mayro2022thecharacterizationof pages 140-144).\n\n7. Function  \nThe biological roles of ABL1 are extensive and diverse, reflecting its involvement in multiple cellular processes that underpin cell growth, survival, and homeostasis. In the cytoplasm, ABL1 modulates actin cytoskeleton dynamics by phosphorylating key regulators such as WASF3, ANXA1, DBN1, DBNL, CTTN, RAPH1, and ENAH; phosphorylation of WASF3 is critical for the formation of lamellipodia and effective cell migration (arrington2019identificationofthe pages 5-6, colicelli2010abltyrosinekinases pages 23-24). It also regulates microtubule-associated proteins like MAPT and PXN, thereby influencing cell structure and motility (colicelli2010abltyrosinekinases pages 5-7, irgit2025structureanddynamics pages 3-4). ABL1 is intimately involved in receptor endocytosis, phosphorylating and modulating proteins such as EGFR and components of the endocytic machinery including caveolin (CAV1) and RIN1, and it exerts regulatory control over the CBL family of ubiquitin ligases that further contribute to receptor turnover and actin remodeling (arrington2019identificationofthe pages 10-11, colicelli2010abltyrosinekinases pages 27-36). In the context of autophagy, ABL1 positively regulates the trafficking and function of lysosomal components, and it has been shown to target mitochondria under oxidative stress conditions, thereby contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction and programmed cell death (irgit2025structureanddynamics pages 5-6, colicelli2010abltyrosinekinases pages 15-16). Within the nucleus, ABL1 translocates in response to DNA damage where it binds DNA directly and phosphorylates substrates involved in the DNA damage response and repair, such as DDB1, DDB2, ERCC3, ERCC6, RAD51, and TP73, ultimately leading to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis when damage is irreparable (colicelli2010abltyrosinekinases pages 36-37, mayro2022thecharacterizationof pages 136-140). Additionally, ABL1 contributes to the regulation of immune cell function, including T-cell differentiation and chemokine-mediated migration, through phosphorylation of transcription factors such as TBX21 and adaptors like NEDD9 and CRK (greuber2013roleofabl pages 14-15, mayro2022thecharacterizationof pages 29-34).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nABL1 is a major therapeutic target in oncology, most notably in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) due to the formation of the constitutively active BCR-ABL1 fusion protein resulting from a t(9;22) chromosomal translocation (colicelli2010abltyrosinekinases pages 37-37, arrington2019identificationofthe pages 10-11). A range of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been developed to target ABL1, including first-generation inhibitors such as imatinib, second-generation inhibitors such as dasatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib, and third-generation agents such as ponatinib; additionally, the allosteric inhibitor asciminib targets the myristate-binding pocket, offering a distinct mechanism of inhibition that circumvents many resistance-conferring mutations (manley2020thespecificityof pages 22-26, larocque2021targetingdrugresistantcancerdriver pages 14-20). Resistance to ATP-competitive inhibitors often arises through mutations in the kinase domain, which underscores the significance of ABL1’s regulatory architecture and the need for diverse inhibitory strategies (colicelli2010abltyrosinekinases pages 23-24, greuber2013roleofabl pages 15-16). Beyond its oncogenic roles, ABL1 is also exploited by several pathogens, with microbial proteins from viruses and bacteria serving as substrates that allow these organisms to hijack host actin cytoskeleton dynamics (arrington2019identificationofthe pages 8-9, mayro2022thecharacterizationof pages 140-144). Thus, ABL1 is linked to both cancer pathology and infectious disease mechanisms. Furthermore, ABL1’s involvement in DNA damage response and its role in the activation of pro-apoptotic pathways situate it at an important nexus between cell survival and programmed cell death, thereby influencing both developmental processes and responses to cellular stress (colicelli2010abltyrosinekinases pages 36-37, mayro2022thecharacterizationof pages 17-24).\n\n9.

Coordinates actin remodeling through tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins controlling cytoskeleton dynamics like MYH10 (involved in movement); CTTN (involved in signaling); or TUBA1 and TUBB (microtubule subunits). Binds directly F-actin and regulates actin cytoskeletal structure through its F-actin-bundling activity. Involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and motility through phosphorylation of key regulators of these processes such as CRK, CRKL, DOK1 or ARHGAP35. Adhesion-dependent phosphorylation of ARHGAP35 promotes its association with RASA1, resulting in recruitment of ARHGAP35 to the cell periphery where it inhibits RHO. Phosphorylates multiple receptor tyrosine kinases like PDGFRB and other substrates which are involved in endocytosis regulation such as RIN1. In brain, may regulate neurotransmission by phosphorylating proteins at the synapse. ABL2 also acts as a regulator of multiple pathological signaling cascades during infection. Pathogens can highjack ABL2 kinase signaling to reorganize the host actin cytoskeleton for multiple purposes, like facilitating intracellular movement and host cell exit. Finally, functions as its own regulator through autocatalytic activity as well as through phosphorylation of its inhibitor, ABI1.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase ABL2, also known as Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2, Abelson tyrosine‐protein kinase 2, ARG, is a member of the Abl family of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases. Evolutionarily, ABL2 and its closely related paralog ABL1 emerged via gene duplication from a single ancestral Abl gene that is conserved in invertebrates; in vertebrates, two distinct Abl isoforms now exist. As part of the human kinome, the Abl kinases are classified within the tyrosine kinase (TK) group, and orthologs of ABL2 have been identified across a broad range of metazoans including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish. This high degree of conservation underscores the critical roles that Abl kinases play in cellular signaling, particularly in pathways that regulate cytoskeletal organization, cell proliferation, motility, and survival (arrington2019identificationofthe pages 3-3, azevedo2019nonreceptortyrosinekinases pages 3-6, baryyan2022newkinasebasedmolecular pages 21-26).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nABL2 catalyzes the classical phosphorylation reaction characteristic of tyrosine kinases. In this reaction, the enzyme transfers the gamma‐phosphate group from ATP to a tyrosine residue on a substrate protein. The chemical reaction can be represented as:  \n  ATP + [protein]–L‑tyrosine → ADP + [protein]–L‑tyrosine‑phosphate + H⁺  \nThis ATP‐dependent phosphotransfer reaction is essential for modulating the function, localization, and interactions of target proteins through reversible phosphorylation (arrington2019identificationofthe pages 3-3).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic efficiency of ABL2, as with most protein kinases, is contingent upon the availability of divalent metal ion cofactors. In particular, Mg²⁺ ions are required to coordinate the binding of ATP within the kinase’s active site and to facilitate the proper transfer of the phosphate group to tyrosine residues on substrate proteins. This cofactor dependency is a hallmark of tyrosine kinase enzymology and is critical for achieving optimal catalytic activity (arrington2019identificationofthe pages 10-11, baryyan2022newkinasebasedmolecular pages 21-26).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nSystematic profiling of the substrate specificity within the human tyrosine kinome has revealed that ABL2 exhibits intrinsic phosphorylation preferences that are largely overlapping with those of other members of the Abl family. Detailed phosphopeptide assays have determined that ABL2 displays a preferential affinity for substrate sequences in which the central tyrosine residue is flanked by hydrophobic amino acids such as leucine, isoleucine, or valine. In some experimental systems, flanking acidic residues appear to be disfavored, resulting in a distinct consensus motif. More specifically, recent studies have indicated an upstream preference for sequences that may conform to an [E/D]x[V/L/I] motif in proximity to the phosphoacceptor tyrosine. Although the inherent substrate specificity of ABL2 substantially resembles that of ABL1, subtle differences in peptide recognition exist that likely impact the regulation of downstream signaling pathways. The elucidation of these motifs has been aided by high‐throughput kinase assays that print a detailed “atlas” of substrate preferences for the tyrosine kinase family (yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 10-11, yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 7-8, yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 8-8).\n\n5. Structure  \nThe three‐dimensional structure of ABL2 is organized into several modular domains that are characteristic of the Abl family of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases. At the N-terminus, ABL2 contains an SH3 (Src homology 3) domain that mediates binding to proline‐rich motifs present in interacting proteins. Adjacent to the SH3 domain is an SH2 (Src homology 2) domain, which specifically recognizes phosphotyrosine-containing sequences; this domain plays a crucial role in substrate recruitment as well as in intramolecular autoinhibitory interactions. Central to the protein is the catalytic kinase domain (often termed the SH1 domain), which adopts a bilobed structure comprising an N-terminal lobe (dominated by beta-sheets) and a C-terminal lobe (predominantly alpha-helical). Within the kinase domain, several key structural elements play pivotal roles in catalysis: the activation loop, whose phosphorylation status modulates the transition from an inactive to an active conformation; the C-helix, which is essential for the proper orientation of ATP and catalytic residues; and the hydrophobic spine, which serves to stabilize the active conformation of the kinase. In addition to these core domains, ABL2 possesses a unique C-terminal region that contains an F-actin binding domain. This domain is responsible for the direct association with filamentous actin and the bundling of actin filaments, thus providing a mechanistic link between kinase activity and the regulation of the cytoskeleton. Structural insights derived from experimental crystallography on homologous Abl kinases, coupled with predictive models from AlphaFold, support a model in which intramolecular interactions among the SH3, SH2, and kinase domains maintain the enzyme in an autoinhibited state that is released upon binding to upstream activators or as a result of post-translational modifications (arrington2019identificationofthe pages 8-9, baryyan2022newkinasebasedmolecular pages 21-26, loris2007exploringstructureand pages 143-146).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe enzymatic activity of ABL2 is subject to precise regulation by several interdependent mechanisms. One primary mode of regulation is autophosphorylation: phosphorylation events within the activation loop relieve autoinhibitory constraints and promote the transition to an active conformation. In parallel, ABL2 is known to phosphorylate its own inhibitor, ABI1, thereby establishing a negative feedback loop that modulates its catalytic output. Furthermore, phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues located in the SH2-kinase linker region by upstream kinases—such as members of the Src family—can destabilize the autoinhibited conformation, thereby enhancing kinase activity. Additionally, intramolecular interactions contribute to regulation; the SH3 domain interacts with a polyproline region within the SH2–kinase linker, while the presence of a myristoylated N-terminus facilitates binding into a hydrophobic pocket in the kinase C-lobe. Such interactions are critical for maintaining the inactive state under basal conditions. Alterations in subcellular localization, particularly those mediated by dynamic binding to F-actin, also influence ABL2 activity by modulating access to substrates and regulatory proteins (arrington2019identificationofthe pages 12-12, daraiseh2017tyrosinephosphorylationof pages 39-44, mayro2022thecharacterizationof pages 17-24).\n\n7. Function  \nABL2 plays a multifaceted role in the orchestration of cellular signaling networks. Central to its function is the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics. By phosphorylating key cytoskeletal regulatory proteins such as MYH10 (a non‐muscle myosin essential for movement), cortactin (CTTN, which participates in actin assembly and signaling), and the microtubule subunits TUBA1 and TUBB, ABL2 directly modulates the organization and dynamics of both the actin and microtubule networks. In addition to its direct effects on the cytoskeleton, ABL2 phosphorylates adaptor proteins involved in cell adhesion and motility—including CRK, CRKL, and DOK1—which further fine-tune cellular responses to extracellular cues. Notably, phosphorylation of the Rho GTPase regulator ARHGAP35 promotes its association with RASA1, thereby recruiting ARHGAP35 to the cell periphery where it exerts inhibitory control over RHO activity and thus remodels cell shape and motility. Beyond cytoskeletal regulation, ABL2 also phosphorylates receptor tyrosine kinases, such as PDGFRB, and proteins implicated in receptor endocytosis like RIN1, which positions ABL2 as a key modulator of receptor internalization and turnover. In the nervous system, ABL2 may contribute to the regulation of neurotransmission by phosphorylating synaptic proteins, while in the immune system, it plays a role in chemokine-mediated T-cell migration, polarization, and homing. These diverse functions are further underscored by the observation that certain pathogens hijack ABL2 signaling to reorganize the host actin cytoskeleton, thereby facilitating intracellular movement and cellular egress (arrington2019identificationofthe pages 8-9, azevedo2019nonreceptortyrosinekinases pages 3-6, creeden2020kinomearrayprofiling pages 32-34, yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 8-8).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nABL2 has attracted considerable attention for its clinical relevance, particularly because of its overlapping inhibitor sensitivity with ABL1. Several tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that target the Abl family, including imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib, and ponatinib, have been approved for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia in which aberrant kinase activity drives disease progression. Although specific mutations or rearrangements in ABL2 have not been as prominently characterized as those in ABL1, dysregulation of ABL2 activity is implicated in a variety of pathological states, including oncogenic transformation and infection-mediated cytoskeletal remodeling. Recent kinome profiling studies have also identified dysregulated ABL2 activity in contexts such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and fibrotic processes, suggesting that altered ABL2 signaling may contribute to the pathogenesis of these conditions. Inhibitor development remains an active area of research, with ongoing efforts to identify compounds that can selectively target ABL2 over ABL1 despite the high degree of conserved domain structure. These disease associations and pharmacological challenges underscore the importance of further dissecting the regulatory mechanisms that govern ABL2 activity and its role in cellular signaling (arrington2019identificationofthe pages 10-11, malnassy2022abl2promotesalcoholassociated pages 36-39, creeden2022pancreaticcancerkinome pages 25-27, tan2015discoveryoftype pages 12-16, creeden2020kinomearrayprofiling pages 16-18).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase FRK, encoded by the FRK gene and alternatively known as PTK5 or RAK, is a non‐receptor tyrosine kinase assigned to the BRK family kinase subgroup. FRK is grouped together with other BRK family members such as BRK (also designated PTK6) and SRMS; these kinases are characterized by a conserved gene splicing pattern that comprises eight exons rather than the eleven typically observed in classical Src family kinases (dai2015effectsoffynrelated pages 26-31, goel2023seekingabetter pages 1-2). In addition to a modular domain organization, FRK maintains a distinct evolutionary lineage compared to classic Src kinases. Phylogenetic analyses based on genome-wide surveys of protein kinases, including seminal work by Manning et al. (2002) in Science and Trends in Biochemical Sciences, have demonstrated that FRK and its relatives emerged from early duplication events early in metazoan evolution. FRK is evolutionarily conserved among mammals and other higher vertebrates, which is underscored by its presence across diverse species and its specialized divergence from the classical Src family based on sequence structure and gene organization (dai2015effectsoffynrelated pages 26-31, corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 146-149). These analyses confirm that FRK occupies a unique branch within the human kinome, one that has evolved distinct regulatory characteristics relevant to its intracellular signaling functions (goel2023seekingabetter pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nFRK catalyzes a classic protein tyrosine kinase reaction. In this reaction, FRK utilizes ATP as the phosphate donor to transfer the gamma-phosphate to the hydroxyl group of tyrosine residues present in substrate proteins. This transfer results in the conversion of ATP to ADP while the substrate protein is modified to carry a phosphotyrosine moiety; the overall chemical reaction is as follows:  \nATP + [protein]-(L-tyrosine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-tyrosine)-phosphate + H⁺.  \nThis biochemical reaction is central to the mechanism by which FRK modulates the function of its substrates via phosphorylation—a process that alters protein conformation, protein–protein interactions, and ultimately, signal transduction pathways within the cell (dai2015effectsoffynrelated pages 26-31, corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 146-149).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe enzymatic activity of FRK, consistent with its classification as a protein kinase, is absolutely dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions. Specifically, Mg²⁺ ions are required to coordinate the binding of ATP within the catalytic pocket. These ions facilitate the proper orientation and stabilization of the ATP molecule so that the gamma-phosphate is optimally positioned for transfer to the tyrosine hydroxyl group of the target substrate. This dependence on Mg²⁺ is a shared feature among the vast majority of protein kinases, underpinning the ATP-dependent phosphorylation mechanism and ensuring robust catalytic activity under physiological conditions (dai2015effectsoffynrelated pages 26-31, corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 146-149).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nFRK displays intrinsic specificity toward substrates characteristic of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases. A well‐documented substrate of FRK is the tumor suppressor protein PTEN, which is phosphorylated by FRK on tyrosine 336. This phosphorylation event plays a critical role in stabilizing PTEN by reducing its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation—likely through a mechanism that diminishes PTEN’s affinity for the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4 (brauer2009rakinginakt pages 1-3, dai2015effectsoffynrelatedb pages 39-42). Although the complete linear consensus motif for FRK is not yet exhaustively defined, studies using peptide library screening, deep-learning coupled proximity proteomics, and intrinsic specificity analysis indicate that FRK generally prefers substrate motifs containing a phosphotyrosine flanked by basic residues on the N-terminal side and hydrophobic residues on the C-terminal side. Such preferences provide a molecular framework to understand FRK’s selection of substrates including PTEN, and they delineate sequence features that may be shared by other natural substrates within the tyrosine kinase signaling network (dai2015effectsoffynrelatedb pages 26-31, yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 7-8).\n\n5. Structure  \nFRK is a 505–amino acid protein that exhibits a modular architecture typical of Src‐related kinases. Its overall domain organization begins with an N-terminal region that is unique to FRK, followed sequentially by an SH3 domain, an SH2 domain, and finally the central catalytic (kinase) domain. The SH3 domain primarily serves to mediate interactions with proline‐rich motifs in partner proteins, while the SH2 domain has dual functions: it recognizes phosphotyrosine-containing sequences and it also harbors a bipartite nuclear localization signal, which has implications for the subcellular distribution of FRK (dai2015effectsoffynrelateda pages 26-31, macausland2019frkcancerrelatedmutations pages 19-22).  \nWithin the catalytic kinase domain, several key structural features have been rigorously defined. An invariant lysine residue, K262, is indispensable for ATP binding, serving as a critical anchor point within the ATP-binding cleft. Moreover, the activation loop within this domain contains tyrosine 387, a residue that undergoes autophosphorylation and is requisite for full catalytic activation. The spatial arrangement of the activation loop, together with the placement of a hydrophobic spine and the positioning of the C-helix, ensures the conformational integrity and proper orientation of residues essential for catalysis (dai2015effectsoffynrelateda pages 26-31, macausland2019frkcancerrelatedmutationsa pages 22-26). A unique structural aspect of FRK is the absence of an N-terminal myristoylation signal—a modification common to many Src family kinases that is pivotal for membrane tethering. This absence likely underpins FRK’s distribution across both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments, a feature that may influence its regulatory and functional interactions (goel2023seekingabetter pages 1-2, macausland2019frkcancerrelatedmutations pages 19-22).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulatory mechanisms governing FRK activity are multifaceted, relying on both intrinsic autophosphorylation events and extrinsic protein–protein interactions. A central regulatory mechanism is the phosphorylation of tyrosine 387 within the activation loop, which is critical for attaining maximal kinase activity. In contrast, phosphorylation of a conserved C-terminal tyrosine residue (Y497) imparts an autoinhibitory effect; when phosphorylated, Y497 engages in intramolecular interactions with the SH2 domain to lock FRK into an inactive conformation (brauer2009rakinginakt pages 1-3, dai2015effectsoffynrelated pages 35-39).  \nFRK further influences cellular signaling through its ability to phosphorylate downstream substrates. The most extensively characterized among these substrates is PTEN, which is phosphorylated on tyrosine 336. This regulatory phosphorylation event is pivotal in stabilizing PTEN by precluding its recognition by the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4, thus reducing PTEN ubiquitination and degradation. As a consequence, the stabilization of PTEN exerts a significant inhibitory effect on the PI3K/AKT pathway, thereby curbing cell proliferation (brauer2009rakinginakt pages 1-3, macausland2019frkcancerrelatedmutations pages 22-26).  \nAdditionally, FRK’s SH2 and SH3 domains participate in allosteric regulation by mediating interactions with both substrates and regulatory proteins. These interactions help to maintain FRK in a conformational state that is receptive to activation signals while preventing aberrant substrate phosphorylation in the absence of appropriate cues (dai2015effectsoffynrelated pages 92-94, macausland2019frkcancerrelatedmutations pages 22-26).\n\n7. Function  \nFunctionally, FRK plays a critical role in the negative regulation of cell proliferation. Its primary biochemical function is to stabilize the tumor suppressor protein PTEN via phosphorylation on tyrosine 336. This modification impedes the binding of NEDD4 to PTEN, thereby protecting PTEN from ubiquitination and degradation. The stabilization of PTEN is fundamental to its ability to down-modulate the PI3K/AKT signaling cascade, which is implicated in cell growth and survival (brauer2009rakinginakt pages 1-3, dai2015effectsoffynrelatedb pages 39-42).  \nFRK is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues including those of the breast, liver, kidney, and colon, where its activity is correlated with growth arrest and reduced migratory properties. Experimental studies employing cellular models such as breast cancer and glioma cell lines have provided evidence that FRK expression is associated with lower rates of cell proliferation and invasion. In these systems, FRK not only stabilizes PTEN but may also interact with additional substrates implicated in cell cycle regulation, including the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), and modulates downstream signaling from receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGFR by promoting receptor internalization and degradation (brauer2009rakinginakt pages 4-5, dai2015effectsoffynrelatedb pages 39-42).  \nDespite its well-characterized tumor-suppressor activity, there are contexts in which FRK exhibits oncogenic properties. For example, in hepatocellular carcinoma, activating mutations within the FRK kinase domain have been associated with increased STAT3 phosphorylation and subsequent tumorigenesis. Nevertheless, the predominant body of experimental evidence supports a role for FRK in restraining cell proliferation through mechanisms that include the stabilization of PTEN and, potentially, other proteins critical for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis (dai2015effectsoffynrelatedb pages 39-42, goel2023seekingabetter pages 1-2).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nFRK presents a dualistic profile in cancer biology, which makes it a target of significant research interest. Its established role in phosphorylating PTEN at Tyr-336 underpins its classification as a tumor suppressor by reducing PTEN degradation and consequently attenuating PI3K/AKT signaling. However, certain studies—particularly in the context of hepatocellular carcinoma—have identified activating mutations within the FRK kinase domain that augment STAT3 phosphorylation and promote tumorigenesis, highlighting a potential context-dependent oncogenic function (macausland2019frkcancerrelatedmutations pages 85-89, dai2015effectsoffynrelatedb pages 39-42).  \nFRK has also been implicated in fusion proteins; an example is the ETV6-FRK fusion found in acute myelogenous leukemia, wherein the fusion protein retains the kinase domain of FRK and exhibits transforming activity that is dependent on its catalytic function. Such fusion proteins have demonstrated sensitivity to kinase inhibitors such as dasatinib, indicating a potential therapeutic angle for malignancies driven by aberrant FRK activity (macausland2019frkcancerrelatedmutationsb pages 19-22, goel2023seekingabetter pages 6-7).  \nAnother notable aspect of FRK is its unique structural composition. The absence of an N-terminal myristoylation signal, a feature observed in many Src family kinases, combined with the presence of a bipartite nuclear localization signal within its SH2 domain, results in a dual cytoplasmic and nuclear localization. This subcellular distribution may directly influence its interaction with substrates and regulatory partners, thereby modulating its overall impact on signal transduction pathways that govern cell proliferation and differentiation.  \nAlthough several experimental inhibitors have been tested on related Src family kinases and fusion proteins involving FRK, to date no highly selective clinical inhibitor has been definitively established for FRK. Nonetheless, these characteristics, along with the identification of cancer-associated mutations and fusion proteins, underscore the importance of further research into selective small-molecule inhibitors that could target FRK in a therapeutic setting (macausland2019frkcancerrelatedmutationsa pages 85-89, macausland2019frkcancerrelatedmutationsb pages 85-89).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695).

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase Fgr, encoded by the FGR (SRC2) gene (Uniprot ID: P09769), belongs to the Src family of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases. Fgr is evolutionarily conserved among vertebrates, and orthologs have been identified in mammals (including murine and human species) as well as in other higher eukaryotes. Within the kinome, Fgr is categorized together with members such as Src, Hck, Lyn, Fyn, Yes, and Blk. Its evolutionary relationships have been established based on sequence conservation and similar modular domain architectures that include the N‐terminal unique region, the SH3 and SH2 domains, and the catalytic kinase domain. Phylogenetic studies, including those by Manning et al. (2002, published in Science and Trends in Biochemical Sciences), indicate that Src family kinases originated from an early duplication event from a common ancestor of eukaryotes; Fgr represents a lineage specialized for regulation in hematopoietic cells (continolo2005theprotooncogenefgr pages 1-2, shen2018thesrcfamily pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nFgr catalyzes the transfer of the terminal phosphate group from ATP to tyrosine residues on target proteins. The general chemical reaction is:  \n ATP + [protein]-L-tyrosine → ADP + [protein]-L-tyrosine-phosphate + H⁺  \nThis reaction is characteristic of tyrosine kinases and is essential for transmitting intracellular signals that control a variety of cellular responses (du2022atpsiteinhibitorsinduce pages 3-5).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of Fgr requires divalent cations to facilitate ATP binding and phosphate transfer. In common with other tyrosine kinases, Fgr is dependent on Mg²⁺ as a crucial cofactor. The presence of Mg²⁺ helps coordinate the phosphate groups of ATP within the kinase active site, thereby supporting phosphorylation reactions (du2022atpsiteinhibitorsinduce pages 3-5).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nFgr phosphorylates tyrosine residues on a range of substrates implicated in immune and cytoskeletal signaling. Its substrate specificity is defined in part by its catalytic domain and the surrounding regulatory regions. Experimentally, Fgr has been shown to phosphorylate targets including the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), cortactin, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and the Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav2 (continolo2005theprotooncogenefgr pages 1-2, continolo2005theprotooncogenefgr pages 14-15). In addition, studies have demonstrated that Fgr can phosphorylate SYK in vitro, thereby promoting downstream signaling (continolo2005theprotooncogenefgr pages 15-16). Although no single consensus motif has been definitively attributed to Fgr substrates, its intrinsic substrate specificity as a tyrosine kinase is consistent with findings reported for the human tyrosine kinome (Yaron-Barir2024 may be consulted for the comprehensive analysis of tyrosine kinase substrate preferences, Johnson2023 is relevant for serine/threonine kinases; both references contextualize the specificity characteristics within the broader kinase family) (shen2018thesrcfamily pages 2-3).\n\n5. Structure  \nFgr exhibits the classic domain organization characteristic of Src family kinases. Its structure is composed of an N‐terminal unique (SH4) domain that is post‐translationally modified by myristoylation and palmitoylation, ensuring proper membrane localization (continolo2005theprotooncogenefgr pages 12-14). Next, the protein contains an SH3 domain responsible for binding polyproline motifs, and an SH2 domain that recognizes phosphorylated tyrosine residues present in target proteins or within intramolecular sequences. Following these regulatory domains lies the central catalytic (kinase) domain, which contains an activation loop that can be phosphorylated on a tyrosine residue analogous to Tyr416 in Src. The C-terminal region harbors an inhibitory phosphorylation site (comparable to Tyr527 in Src) that, when phosphorylated by kinases such as C-terminal Src kinase (CSK), stabilizes an autoinhibited conformation (continolo2005theprotooncogenefgr pages 14-15, shen2018thesrcfamily pages 6-7). Recent crystallographic studies, particularly those using ATP-site inhibitors (A-419259 and TL02–59), have detailed that Fgr can adopt multiple conformations. In the presence of A-419259, Fgr is locked in a closed conformation with an outward rotation of the C-helix that disrupts the Glu310-Lys295 salt bridge; conversely, TL02–59 binding induces a type II conformation with the αC-helix rotated inward and the formation of the Glu310-Lys295 ion pair (du2022atpsiteinhibitorsinduce pages 14-18, du2022atpsiteinhibitorsinduce pages 18-23). These structures reveal both intramolecular dimerization interfaces and allosteric uncoupling of the regulatory SH3/SH2 domains from the catalytic core (du2022atpsiteinhibitorsinduce pages 23-26).\n\n6. Regulation  \nFgr activity is regulated by multiple post-translational modifications and intramolecular domain interactions. The N-terminal lipid modifications (myristoylation and palmitoylation) are essential for targeting Fgr to the plasma membrane, where it associates with receptor complexes, ensuring its proper spatial regulation (continolo2005theprotooncogenefgr pages 1-2, continolo2005theprotooncogenefgr pages 12-14). Phosphorylation of the activation loop—analogous to Tyr416 in Src—serves to activate the kinase by promoting a conformational change that aligns the catalytic residues, while phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail provides an inhibitory signal through binding to the SH2 domain (continolo2005theprotooncogenefgr pages 14-15, shen2018thesrcfamily pages 6-7). In specific cellular contexts, Fgr forms complexes with proteins such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and p190RhoGAP, which modulate downstream signaling involved in cytoskeletal rearrangement and cell migration (continolo2005theprotooncogenefgr pages 15-16, gresham2000negativeregulationof pages 1-2). Moreover, structural studies demonstrate that binding of ATP-competitive inhibitors can induce distinct conformational states that affect the regulatory interactions between the kinase and its SH domains (du2022atpsiteinhibitorsinduce pages 5-6, du2022atpsiteinhibitorsinduce pages 8-9). Fgr phosphorylation of its substrates is also influenced by PI3K-dependent mechanisms, and its activity can be modulated by extracellular signals, such as those mediated by integrins and immunoglobulin Fc receptors, which in turn alters the phosphorylation status of both Fgr and its interacting partners (continolo2005theprotooncogenefgr pages 1-2, vines2001inhibitionofβ2 pages 1-2).\n\n7. Function  \nFgr has diverse roles in immune cell signaling and cytoskeletal regulation. In hematopoietic cells—particularly in neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and mast cells—Fgr transduces signals from receptors that do not possess intrinsic kinase activity. In mast cells, Fgr is required for FcεRI-mediated signaling that results in Syk activation, subsequent phosphorylation of downstream adaptor proteins (including LAT, SLP76, and Gab2), and ultimately mast cell degranulation and cytokine release, contributing to IgE-mediated anaphylaxis (lee2011thesrcfamily pages 1-2, lee2011thesrcfamily pages 6-7). In macrophages and monocytes, Fgr plays a dual role where it can act as a positive regulator of migration by activating Rac and promoting actin cytoskeletal reorganization, while simultaneously serving as a negative regulator of integrin (ITGB2) signaling and phagocytosis through interactions with Syk and the recruitment of inhibitory phosphatases (gresham2000negativeregulationof pages 13-14, vines2001inhibitionofβ2 pages 7-9). Fgr also phosphorylates components of the focal adhesion complexes, including FAK and cortactin, linking adhesion dynamics to cell motility (continolo2005theprotooncogenefgr pages 15-16). In the context of hematological malignancies, particularly acute myeloid leukemia (AML), Fgr is frequently overexpressed and constitutively active; knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of Fgr in AML cell models leads to reduced cellular proliferation and tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo (du2022atpsiteinhibitorsinduce pages 1-3, weir2018selectiveinhibitionof pages 1-4). Thus, Fgr participates in signaling pathways downstream of immunoglobulin Fc receptors (MS4A2/FCER1B, FCGR2A/FCGR2B) and integrins (ITGB1 and ITGB2) to modulate cytoskeletal rearrangements, cell adhesion, migration, and inflammatory responses while its dysregulation has been implicated in oncogenesis and inflammation (continolo2005theprotooncogenefgr pages 1-2, lee2011thesrcfamily pages 7-8, shu2025constitutiveactivationof pages 1-2).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nRecent studies have also identified small molecule inhibitors that target Fgr specifically. ATP-site inhibitors such as A-419259 and TL02–59 have been shown to induce unique conformations in Fgr, leading to potent suppression of its kinase activity in AML models (du2022atpsiteinhibitorsinduce pages 14-18, du2022atpsiteinhibitorsinduce pages 5-8). In addition, gain-of-function mutations in Fgr have been associated with autoinflammatory bone diseases in both mice and humans, with specific missense mutations (e.g., p.Arg118Trp, p.Asp502Gly) resulting in increased kinase activity and pathological bone inflammation (abe2019gainoffunctionmutationsin pages 3-3). Inhibitors of Fgr may hold clinical promise not only for AML but potentially for other immunologically mediated conditions. Fgr’s dual role as a positive regulator of certain pathways (e.g., mast cell degranulation and migration) and a negative regulator in integrin-dependent phagocytosis underscores the potential for context-dependent therapeutic strategies (continolo2005theprotooncogenefgr pages 15-16, vines2001inhibitionofβ2 pages 12-13).  \nFurthermore, Fgr has been shown to interact with a number of signaling molecules, including SYK, PIK3R1, PLD2, FAK, CBL, and VAV2, placing it at a nodal point in the regulation of immune receptor signaling, cytoskeletal dynamics and, ultimately, cellular motility and inflammatory responses (continolo2005theprotooncogenefgr pages 14-15, lee2011thesrcfamily pages 5-6). This broad involvement in multiple pathways makes Fgr a notable target for drug development, and ongoing studies continue to evaluate its substrate specificity within the tyrosine kinome (Yaron-Barir2024, Johnson2023). Its regulation by intracellular localization and tyrosine phosphorylation further adds layers of complexity that may be exploited by selective inhibitors (du2022atpsiteinhibitorsinduce pages 8-9, shen2018thesrcfamily pages 7-8).\n\n9.

Inactive FYN is phosphorylated on its C-terminal tail within the catalytic domain (PubMed:15489916). Following activation by PKA, the protein subsequently associates with PTK2/FAK1, allowing PTK2/FAK1 phosphorylation, activation and targeting to focal adhesions (PubMed:15489916). Involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and motility through phosphorylation of CTNNB1 (beta-catenin) and CTNND1 (delta-catenin) (PubMed:17194753). Regulates cytoskeletal remodeling by phosphorylating several proteins including the actin regulator WAS and the microtubule-associated proteins MAP2 and MAPT (PubMed:14707117, PubMed:15536091). Promotes cell survival by phosphorylating AGAP2/PIKE-A and preventing its apoptotic cleavage (PubMed:16841086). Participates in signal transduction pathways that regulate the integrity of the glomerular slit diaphragm (an essential part of the glomerular filter of the kidney) by phosphorylating several slit diaphragm components including NPHS1, KIRREL1 and TRPC6 (PubMed:14761972, PubMed:18258597, PubMed:19179337). Plays a role in neural processes by phosphorylating DPYSL2, a multifunctional adapter protein within the central nervous system, ARHGAP32, a regulator for Rho family GTPases implicated in various neural functions, and SNCA, a small pre-synaptic protein (PubMed:11162638, PubMed:12788081, PubMed:19652227). Involved in reelin signaling by mediating phosphorylation of DAB1 following reelin (RELN)-binding to its receptor (By similarity). Participates in the downstream signaling pathways that lead to T-cell differentiation and proliferation following T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation (PubMed:22080863). Phosphorylates PTK2B/PYK2 in response to T-cell receptor activation (PubMed:20028775). Also participates in negative feedback regulation of TCR signaling through phosphorylation of PAG1, thereby promoting interaction between PAG1 and CSK and recruitment of CSK to lipid rafts (PubMed:18056706). CSK maintains LCK and FYN in an inactive form (By similarity). Promotes CD28-induced phosphorylation of VAV1 (PubMed:11005864). In mast cells, phosphorylates CLNK after activation of immunoglobulin epsilon receptor signaling (By similarity). Can also promote CD244-mediated NK cell activation (PubMed:15713798)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase Fyn is a member of the Src family kinases (SFKs), a sub‐group of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases that are conserved across metazoans. Fyn is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian species and has identifiable orthologs across vertebrates that share a common domain organization and regulatory mechanism with other SFKs such as c‐Src, Yes, and Lyn (roskoski2004srcprotein–tyrosinekinase pages 1-2, ingley2008srcfamilykinases pages 1-2). Fyn is placed within the evolutionary branch that emerged early in eukaryotic evolution, and phylogenetic studies based on the kinase complement of the human genome have demonstrated that Fyn and its related kinases trace their origin to a common ancestral kinase predating the divergence between yeast and man. Its evolutionary conservation is underscored by the characteristic modular structure comprising an N‐terminal SH4 domain, a unique region, SH3 and SH2 domains, followed by the catalytic kinase domain and a C‐terminal regulatory tail (marotta2022roleoffyn pages 1-1, roskoski2004srcprotein–tyrosinekinase pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase Fyn catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of tyrosine residues present on substrate proteins. The generalized chemical reaction is:  \n  ATP + [protein – tyrosine] → ADP + [protein – phosphotyrosine] + H⁺  \nThis phosphorylation reaction is fundamental to cell signaling pathways and is involved in modulating the activity, interaction, and subcellular location of numerous target proteins (jelic2007homologymodelingof pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of Fyn kinase requires the presence of divalent metal ions; specifically, Mg²⁺ is essential for forming a stable complex with ATP within the active site. This cofactor facilitates proper positioning of the ATP molecule and is necessary for efficient phosphoryl transfer to substrates (cowanjacob2006structuralbiologyof pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nThe intrinsic substrate specificity of Fyn, as a member of the human tyrosine kinome, has been profiled using combinatorial peptide arrays and high‐throughput methods. Fyn shows a preference for target tyrosine residues embedded within peptide motifs that typically include a hydrophobic residue preceding the phosphoacceptor tyrosine and a polar or acidic residue immediately following it. This selectivity is consistent with the broader substrate preferences of Src family kinases, which rely on interactions mediated by their SH2 and SH3 domains to direct phosphorylation events (yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 1-2).\n\n5. Structure  \nFyn kinase is organized into several conserved domains that are crucial for its catalytic function and regulatory interactions. At the very N‐terminus, the SH4 domain, which undergoes myristoylation and in some cases palmitoylation, mediates membrane attachment and subcellular localization (kinoshita2006structureofhuman pages 1-2, matrone2020fyntyrosinekinase pages 3-6). Following the SH4 domain is a unique region that is less conserved; this region can help determine specific protein–protein interactions. Next, the SH3 domain, typically around 50 amino acids, recognizes proline‐rich motifs in interacting partners, thereby contributing to both intramolecular regulation and substrate binding (roskoski2004srcprotein–tyrosinekinase pages 1-2, ingley2008srcfamilykinases pages 1-2). The subsequent SH2 domain, approximately 100 amino acids in length, binds to phosphotyrosine motifs present on target proteins with specificity dictated by surrounding amino acid sequences. Centrally located is the catalytic or kinase domain (SH1 domain), which adopts a bilobed structure; the smaller N‐terminal lobe is involved in ATP binding, whereas the larger C‐terminal lobe confers substrate specificity. Key structural features of this catalytic domain include the activation loop, a conserved C‐helix, and the hydrophobic spine that stabilizes the active conformation. A short C‐terminal tail contains a regulatory tyrosine residue that, when phosphorylated, binds intramolecularly to the SH2 domain, leading to the autoinhibited conformation of Fyn (jelic2007homologymodelingof pages 2-3, matrone2020fyntyrosinekinase pages 8-10, roskoski2004srcprotein–tyrosinekinase pages 1-2). Several high‐resolution crystal structures and homology models, based on templates with 70–80% sequence identity such as c‐Src, have been used to delineate these structural features in Fyn (jelic2007homologymodelingof pages 8-9).\n\n6. Regulation  \nFyn regulation occurs via multiple post‐translational modifications and protein–protein interactions. A primary regulatory mechanism is phosphorylation. In its inactive state, Fyn is phosphorylated at a conserved C‐terminal tyrosine (for example, Tyr531 in FynB isoform), which facilitates an intramolecular interaction with the SH2 domain that maintains the kinase in a closed conformation (matrone2020fyntyrosinekinase pages 1-3, taleski2020thederegulationof pages 28-31). Activation of Fyn involves dephosphorylation of this inhibitory site coupled with autophosphorylation of a tyrosine residue in the activation loop (Tyr420 in the FynB isoform) that stabilizes the active configuration of the catalytic domain (taleski2020thederegulationof pages 31-34, crosby2003physicalandfunctional pages 4-5). In addition to phosphorylation events, Fyn activity is modulated by lipid modifications such as myristoylation and palmitoylation at the SH4 domain, which are required for its association with the plasma membrane and lipid rafts (kinoshita2006structureofhuman pages 1-2, matrone2020fyntyrosinekinase pages 3-6). Fyn also interacts with regulatory proteins such as C-terminal Src kinase (CSK); CSK phosphorylates the inhibitory C-terminal tyrosine and thereby contributes to negative feedback regulation (parravicini2002fynkinaseinitiates pages 5-5, taleski2020thederegulationof pages 77-80).\n\n7. Function  \nFyn kinase plays diverse roles in numerous biological processes. It is involved in the regulation of cell growth, survival, and motility, and it mediates signal transduction downstream of multiple receptors. In the context of cell adhesion and integrin-mediated signaling, Fyn phosphorylates proteins such as beta-catenin (CTNNB1) and delta-catenin (CTNND1), thereby influencing cytoskeletal remodeling and cellular motility (jelic2007homologymodelingof pages 1-2). Fyn also regulates actin dynamics and microtubule stability by phosphorylating actin regulatory proteins and microtubule-associated proteins such as MAP2 and MAPT (matrone2020fyntyrosinekinase pages 10-12). In immune cells, Fyn participates in T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling by phosphorylating key substrates including PTK2B/PYK2 and PAG1; these phosphorylation events modulate both positive signaling cascades that promote T-cell differentiation and negative feedback loops that limit TCR signaling (jin2017anessentialrole pages 1-2, parravicini2002fynkinaseinitiates pages 5-5). In mast cells, Fyn phosphorylates adaptor proteins such as CLNK following immunoglobulin epsilon receptor activation, contributing to degranulation responses (parravicini2002fynkinaseinitiates pages 5-5). In neuronal cells, Fyn is critical for processes including axon guidance, neural migration, and synaptic plasticity; it phosphorylates substrates like DPYSL2 and ARHGAP32 and interacts with factors implicated in reelin signaling (jin2017anessentialrole pages 13-14, matrone2020fyntyrosinekinase pages 12-14). Furthermore, Fyn is involved in the phosphorylation of proteins at the glomerular slit diaphragm, implicating it in the regulation of kidney filtration processes (jelic2007homologymodelingof pages 1-2). Collectively, these diverse roles underscore Fyn kinase as an integrator of signaling pathways that coordinate cellular adhesion, cytoskeletal architecture, immune cell activation, and neural function (matrone2020fyntyrosinekinase pages 1-3, taleski2020thederegulationof pages 31-34).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral small-molecule inhibitors have been identified and developed to target Fyn kinase activity. Among these, natural compounds such as rosmarinic acid have been characterized as non-ATP competitive inhibitors that bind to alternative pockets on the kinase surface, while broad-spectrum inhibitors like staurosporine exhibit ATP-competitive inhibition (jelic2007homologymodelingof pages 9-10, marotta2022roleoffyn pages 7-9). In addition, drugs such as dasatinib and saracatinib, initially developed for oncological indications, have been repurposed due to their activity against Fyn in preclinical models of neurodegeneration and immune disorders (marotta2022roleoffyn pages 4-6, taleski2020thederegulationof pages 77-80). Dysregulated Fyn activity has been associated with various pathological conditions including cancer, autoimmune disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, where aberrant Fyn signaling contributes to synaptic dysfunction and tau hyperphosphorylation (taleski2020thederegulationof pages 80-83, marotta2022roleoffyn pages 11-12). The promiscuity associated with the conserved ATP-binding pocket among Src family kinases has presented challenges in the development of highly selective Fyn inhibitors; therefore, ongoing research focuses on developing compounds that exploit subtle structural differences or alternative binding sites to maximize selectivity (passannanti2021applicationofcomputational pages 120-122, roskoski2004srcprotein–tyrosinekinase pages 2-3).\n\n9.

    "answer": "Question: # Information\n\n**Protein Name: Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src / gene: SRC SRC1**\n**Uniprot Id: P12931**\n**Protein alternative names: Proto-oncogene c-Src; pp60c-src**\n**Protein Function: Non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase which is activated following engagement of many different classes of cellular receptors including immune response receptors, integrins and other adhesion receptors, receptor protein tyrosine kinases, G protein-coupled receptors as well as cytokine receptors (PubMed:34234773). Participates in signaling pathways that control a diverse spectrum of biological activities including gene transcription, immune response, cell adhesion, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, migration, and transformation. Due to functional redundancy between members of the SRC kinase family, identification of the specific role of each SRC kinase is very difficult. SRC appears to be one of the primary kinases activated following engagement of receptors and plays a role in the activation of other protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) families. Receptor clustering or dimerization leads to recruitment of SRC to the receptor complexes where it phosphorylates the tyrosine residues within the receptor cytoplasmic domains. Plays an important role in the regulation of cytoskeletal organization through phosphorylation of specific substrates such as AFAP1. Phosphorylation of AFAP1 allows the SRC SH2 domain to bind AFAP1 and to localize to actin filaments. Cytoskeletal reorganization is also controlled through the phosphorylation of cortactin (CTTN) (Probable). When cells adhere via focal adhesions to the extracellular matrix, signals are transmitted by integrins into the cell resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of focal adhesion proteins, including PTK2/FAK1 and paxillin (PXN) (PubMed:21411625). In addition to phosphorylating focal adhesion proteins, SRC is also active at the sites of cell-cell contact adherens junctions and phosphorylates substrates such as beta-catenin (CTNNB1), delta-catenin (CTNND1), and plakoglobin (JUP). Another type of cell-cell junction, the gap junction, is also a target for SRC, which phosphorylates connexin-43 (GJA1). SRC is implicated in regulation of pre-mRNA-processing and phosphorylates RNA-binding proteins such as KHDRBS1 (Probable). Phosphorylates PKP3 at 'Tyr-195' in response to reactive oxygen species, which may cause the release of PKP3 from desmosome cell junctions into the cytoplasm (PubMed:25501895). Also plays a role in PDGF-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of both STAT1 and STAT3, leading to increased DNA binding activity of these transcription factors (By similarity). Involved in the RAS pathway through phosphorylation of RASA1 and RASGRF1 (PubMed:11389730). Plays a role in EGF-mediated calcium-activated chloride channel activation (PubMed:18586953). Required for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) internalization through phosphorylation of clathrin heavy chain (CLTC and CLTCL1) at 'Tyr-1477'. Involved in beta-arrestin (ARRB1 and ARRB2) desensitization through phosphorylation and activation of GRK2, leading to beta-arrestin phosphorylation and internalization. Has a critical role in the stimulation of the CDK20/MAPK3 mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade by epidermal growth factor (Probable). Might be involved not only in mediating the transduction of mitogenic signals at the level of the plasma membrane but also in controlling progression through the cell cycle via interaction with regulatory proteins in the nucleus (PubMed:7853507). Plays an important role in osteoclastic bone resorption in conjunction with PTK2B/PYK2. Both the formation of a SRC-PTK2B/PYK2 complex and SRC kinase activity are necessary for this function. Recruited to activated integrins by PTK2B/PYK2, thereby phosphorylating CBL, which in turn induces the activation and recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to the cell membrane in a signaling pathway that is critical for osteoclast function (PubMed:14585963, PubMed:8755529). Promotes energy production in osteoclasts by activating mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase (PubMed:12615910). Phosphorylates DDR2 on tyrosine residues, thereby promoting its subsequent autophosphorylation (PubMed:16186108). Phosphorylates RUNX3 and COX2 on tyrosine residues, TNK2 on 'Tyr-284' and CBL on 'Tyr-731' (PubMed:20100835, PubMed:21309750). Enhances RIGI-elicited antiviral signaling (PubMed:19419966). Phosphorylates PDPK1 at 'Tyr-9', 'Tyr-373' and 'Tyr-376' (PubMed:14585963). Phosphorylates BCAR1 at 'Tyr-128' (PubMed:22710723). Phosphorylates CBLC at multiple tyrosine residues, phosphorylation at 'Tyr-341' activates CBLC E3 activity (PubMed:20525694). Phosphorylates synaptic vesicle protein synaptophysin (SYP) (By similarity). Involved in anchorage-independent cell growth (PubMed:19307596). Required for podosome formation (By similarity). Mediates IL6 signaling by activating YAP1-NOTCH pathway to induce inflammation-induced epithelial regeneration (PubMed:25731159). Phosphorylates OTUB1, promoting deubiquitination of RPTOR (PubMed:35927303). Phosphorylates caspase CASP8 at 'Tyr-380' which negatively regulates CASP8 processing and activation, down-regulating CASP8 proapoptotic function (PubMed:16619028)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nProto‐oncogene tyrosine‐protein kinase Src is a member of the non‐receptor protein tyrosine kinase family known as the Src family kinases (SFKs), which are found in all metazoans and can be traced back to early unicellular holozoans. Src displays a high degree of conservation across species, with well‐characterized orthologs in species such as chicken (where Tyr527 was first described), mouse, and human, consistent with its inclusion in the evolutionary core set of protein kinases that emerged prior to multicellularity (sicheri1997structuresofsrcfamily pages 1-2, brickell1991thecsrcfamily pages 1-3, taskinen2017earlyemergenceof pages 1-2). Within the human kinome, Src is classified in a subgroup of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases that is distinct from receptor tyrosine kinases and is evolutionarily related to other SFKs such as Fyn, Yes, Lyn, Lck, Hck, and others (sicheri1997structuresofsrcfamily pages 1-2, taskinen2017earlyemergenceof pages 1-2). The pioneering studies by Manning and colleagues have documented the evolutionary conservation and diversification of these kinases from yeast to man, establishing their phylogenetic context within a broad family of regulatory enzymes (Manning et al. 2002, Manning et al. 2002).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nSrc catalyzes the transfer of the γ‐phosphate from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to specific tyrosine residues on substrate proteins, thereby converting ATP into adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and phosphorylating the target protein on a tyrosine residue. In chemical terms, the reaction can be represented as:  \nATP + [protein]–tyrosine → ADP + [protein]–phosphotyrosine + H⁺ (template adapted).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of Src is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions, most commonly magnesium (Mg²⁺), which is required to coordinate the binding of ATP in the active site. Mg²⁺ functions as a cofactor that facilitates proper ATP orientation for effective phosphotransfer (roskoski2004srcprotein–tyrosinekinase pages 1-2, roskoski2004srcprotein–tyrosinekinase pages 2-3).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nSrc exhibits intrinsic substrate specificity as a tyrosine kinase. Recent investigations into the intrinsic substrate specificity of the human tyrosine kinome indicate that Src preferentially phosphorylates substrates that contain a recognition motif characterized by a central tyrosine flanked by acidic and hydrophobic residues. For example, a consensus motif may involve a pattern in which the target tyrosine is preceded by hydrophobic residues and followed by acidic amino acids, defining the recognition sequence that facilitates substrate binding (Yaron-Barir2024 pages 1174-1181). This substrate preference allows Src to phosphorylate a wide range of substrates involved in adhesion, migration, and signal transduction—including cytoskeletal proteins and focal adhesion components—thus integrating a diverse array of cellular responses (alcala2020targetingsrckinase pages 19-21).\n\n5. Structure  \nSrc is organized into several distinct structural domains that work cooperatively to regulate its activity. At the extreme N-terminus, the SH4 domain contains a myristoylation signal that facilitates membrane localization. Adjacent to the SH4 domain is a Variable (Unique) region that confers isoform-specific functions. This is followed sequentially by the SH3 and SH2 domains; the SH3 domain recognizes proline-rich sequences, whereas the SH2 domain binds to phosphotyrosine-containing motifs, and both domains also contribute to autoinhibition by interacting intramolecularly with other regions of the protein. The central catalytic domain (often referred to as the SH1 or kinase domain) contains an activation loop that includes a key tyrosine residue (Tyr416 in chicken Src, with minor numbering differences in human Src) whose phosphorylation is associated with full activation, and possesses a conserved C-helix that is critical for proper catalytic alignment. Finally, a C-terminal tail contains the regulatory tyrosine residue (Tyr527 in chicken Src) whose phosphorylation by C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) promotes the inactive conformation by binding the SH2 domain (roskoski2004srcprotein–tyrosinekinase pages 5-7, sicheri1997structuresofsrcfamily pages 1-2). These structurally defined modules collectively enable Src to adopt distinct conformations ranging from an autoinhibited state to a catalytically active state (shah2018thesrcmodule pages 1-3).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of Src involves multiple layers of control. A key mechanism is phosphorylation‐dependent conformational change: autophosphorylation within the activation loop (typically at Tyr416) stabilizes the active conformation, while phosphorylation at the C-terminal regulatory tyrosine (Tyr527) by Csk enforces an inactive conformation by promoting intramolecular binding of the SH2 domain (chong2005endogenousandsynthetic pages 1-2, roskoski2004srcprotein–tyrosinekinase pages 9-10). Additional post-translational modifications include acetylation, ubiquitination, SUMOylation, and oxidation, which collectively modulate Src’s cellular localization, stability, and kinase activity. For instance, lipid modifications such as myristoylation at the N-terminus are essential for proper membrane targeting, while reactive oxygen species have been reported to alter Src activity through reversible oxidation (min2022crosstalkbetweenwnt pages 23-24). Moreover, regulatory proteins such as protein tyrosine phosphatases (for example, RPTPα) are responsible for dephosphorylating key regulatory residues and thus contribute to the dynamic control of Src activity. The conformational balance between its inactive (closed) and active (open) states is maintained by these combined phosphorylation events and interdomain interactions (roskoski2004srcprotein–tyrosinekinase pages 8-9, chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 1-2).\n\n7. Function  \nSrc plays an integral role in transducing a variety of extracellular signals into appropriate intracellular responses. Upon activation by receptor clustering or dimerization at the plasma membrane—including engagement of immune receptors, integrins, receptor tyrosine kinases, G protein‐coupled receptors, and cytokine receptors—Src is recruited to receptor complexes where it phosphorylates intracellular substrates. These substrates include cytoskeletal regulatory proteins such as AFAP1 and cortactin, focal adhesion components such as focal adhesion kinase (PTK2/FAK) and paxillin, and junctional proteins like beta-catenin, thereby modulating cytoskeletal organization, cell adhesion, and migration (alcala2020targetingsrckinase pages 19-21, correlative details from Information section). Src also influences gene transcription and cell cycle progression by phosphorylating RNA-binding proteins and components of mitogen-activated signaling pathways, including those activated by PDGF and EGF. In addition, Src has been implicated in the Ras pathway via phosphorylation of regulators such as RASA1 and RASGRF1, and in receptor internalization through phosphorylation of clathrin heavy chain, thereby linking it to endocytic mechanisms. Src-mediated phosphorylation events contribute to key biological processes such as immune responses, osteoclast function in bone resorption, and even antiviral signaling via modulation of RIG-I pathways. This broad substrate repertoire and its central position at the hub of multiple signaling networks underscore the critical role of Src as a primary kinase activated by numerous receptors, facilitating further activation of downstream protein tyrosine kinase families (alcala2020targetingsrckinase pages 19-21, jin2020regulationofsrc pages 1-3).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nA number of small-molecule inhibitors have been developed to target Src kinase activity, with compounds such as dasatinib and BMS-354825 demonstrating potent, selective antitumor activity in preclinical models. The clinical relevance of Src is highlighted by its frequent overexpression and hyperactivation in various human cancers including breast, colorectal, pancreatic, and ovarian carcinomas. Given the functional redundancy among SFKs, the development of Src inhibitors is of particular interest for personalized cancer therapy and for overcoming therapy resistance. In addition, disease-associated mutations and post-translational dysregulations have been reported to enhance Src kinase activity, which can promote oncogenesis by deregulating cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation (jin2020regulationofsrc pages 15-17, chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 2-3). The complexity of Src regulation—encompassing phosphorylation dynamics, protein-protein interactions mediated by its SH2 and SH3 domains, and other modifications such as ubiquitination—provides multiple targets for pharmacological intervention. Furthermore, ongoing research continues to refine our understanding of its intrinsic substrate specificity, as detailed in recent high-resolution studies of the human tyrosine kinome (Yaron-Barir2024 pages 1174-1181).  \n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase Yes (YES1, also known as c‐Yes or p61‐Yes) belongs to the Src family of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases, a group of evolutionarily conserved enzymes present in metazoans. YES1 is broadly expressed in mammalian tissues and shares high sequence homology with other family members such as c‐Src and Fyn, with the kinase domain exhibiting approximately 90% identity between YES1 and c‐Src. Its evolutionary origin can be traced to early eukaryotes, and homologs are present from simple unicellular organisms up to complex mammals, consistent with the evolutionary analyses of the protein kinase complement across species (clump2005cyesresponseto pages 1-2, summy2001functionaldomaincontributions pages 7-12). YES1 is grouped within the Src family kinases (SFKs) – a family that includes kinases with ubiquitous expression profiles (e.g., c‐Src, YES1, Fyn) as well as others with more restricted distributions such as Lyn and Lck – and its evolutionary conservation underlies its fundamental role in transducing extracellular signals (garmendia2022yes1anovel pages 1-1, kook2024emergingrolesof pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nYES1 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of specific tyrosine residues in substrate proteins. In this phosphorylation reaction, ATP and a protein substrate (bearing a tyrosine residue) are converted into ADP and a phosphorylated protein (with a phosphotyrosine residue), with the concomitant release of a proton. This reaction is fundamental to signal transduction pathways and modulates the activity, localization, and interactions of the substrate proteins (clump2005cyesresponseto pages 2-3, yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe enzymatic activity of YES1, like that of most protein kinases, depends on the presence of divalent metal ions. Magnesium ions (Mg²⁺) serve as an essential cofactor for the kinase activity of YES1, coordinating with ATP to facilitate the transfer of the phosphoryl group. This cofactor requirement is critical for stabilizing the nucleotide and aligning the reactive groups during catalysis (yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nYES1 exhibits intrinsic substrate specificity determined by its kinase domain in conjunction with its regulatory SH2 and SH3 domains. As a tyrosine kinase, YES1 recognizes consensus peptide motifs in substrate proteins that typically include a central tyrosine residue flanked by specific amino acids. Detailed mapping of the substrate preferences across the human tyrosine kinome has revealed that YES1 favors sequences with acidic residues at certain positions around the phosphoacceptor site along with preferences dictated by residues in the −5 to +5 positions (yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 16-16). The recognition of these motifs, which involves a balance between substrate peptide conformation and the spatial orientation of catalytic residues, is critical for determining which intracellular targets become phosphorylated during YES1-mediated signal transduction (clump2005cyesresponseto pages 3-5, kook2024emergingrolesof pages 2-4).\n\n5. Structure  \nYES1 is organized into several modular domains with distinct functions that together define its structural and regulatory properties. At the N-terminus, YES1 contains an SH4 domain that undergoes co-translational myristoylation and post-translational palmitoylation, modifications that secure the enzyme to the plasma membrane and to cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich microdomains; this subcellular localization is essential for its interaction with activated receptor tyrosine kinases (clump2005cyesresponseto pages 1-2, kook2024emergingrolesof pages 2-4). Immediately following the SH4 domain is the Unique domain, which is less conserved among SFKs and is believed to confer additional specificity by providing docking sites and modulating interactions with other proteins. The subsequent SH3 and SH2 domains mediate specific protein-protein interactions by binding to proline-rich motifs and phosphotyrosine-containing sequences, respectively; these interactions help assemble signaling complexes and position YES1 in proximity to its substrates (summy2001functionaldomaincontributions pages 25-30, garmendia2022yes1anovel pages 2-3). Centrally located is the catalytic kinase (SH1) domain, which contains the active site, including the activation loop, key catalytic residues such as the ATP-binding lysine, and regions forming the hydrophobic spine and C-helix. Although crystal structures for YES1 specifically are limited, models derived from closely related SFKs and AlphaFold predictions reveal that YES1 adopts a typical bilobal kinase fold common to protein kinases, with an N-terminal lobe dominated by β-sheets and a predominantly helical C-terminal lobe responsible for substrate binding and catalysis (garmendia2022yes1anovel pages 3-4, summy2001functionaldomaincontributions pages 169-174). A notable structural feature of YES1 is its capacity for reversible palmitoylation on its SH4 domain, which distinguishes its membrane targeting from that of c-Src and influences its downstream signaling (kook2024emergingrolesof pages 2-4, clump2005cyesresponseto pages 1-2).\n\n6. Regulation  \nYES1 activity is regulated by multiple mechanisms that include post-translational modifications and protein-protein interactions. Autophosphorylation events within the kinase domain modulate its catalytic efficiency, while phosphorylation at specific tyrosine residues within the C-terminal regulatory region can promote an inactive conformation via intramolecular interactions with the SH2 domain. In addition, YES1 is subject to regulation by upstream kinases such as C-terminal Src kinase (Csk), which phosphorylates sites that contribute to its autoinhibition. Post-translational lipid modifications—myristoylation and palmitoylation of the SH4 domain—are critical for its proper subcellular localization, and modifications such as S-nitrosylation at conserved cysteine residues (for instance, analogous to the regulation mechanisms seen in c-Src) can modulate kinase activity in response to cellular signals (kook2024emergingrolesof pages 6-7, clump2005cyesresponseto pages 9-10). Furthermore, YES1 phosphorylation of specific substrates is often controlled by receptor activation; for example, upon EGFR stimulation, YES1 is recruited to the receptor complex and activated via subsequent phosphorylation events, enabling it to phosphorylate targets involved in tight junction assembly and other functions (clump2005cyesresponseto pages 7-8, garmendia2022yes1anovel pages 6-7).\n\n7. Function  \nYES1 is a multifunctional non-receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a critical role in various cellular processes. It is involved in the regulation of cell growth and survival, mediating signals that promote proliferation via pathways such as the MAPK and PI3K/AKT cascades. YES1 participates in the regulation of the cell cycle by phosphorylating cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), thereby influencing the G1 phase, and functions in G2/M progression and cytokinesis, contributing to proper cell division (clump2005cyesresponseto pages 7-8, garmendia2022yes1anovel pages 8-9). In addition, YES1 has been shown to control apoptosis and is implicated in cellular differentiation and cytoskeleton remodeling. For instance, YES1 modulates cell-cell adhesion by phosphorylating components of tight junctions, such as PARD3, following activation of receptor tyrosine kinases like EGFR; this function is critical for the assembly and maintenance of epithelial tight junctions (clump2005cyesresponseto pages 5-6, garmendia2022yes1anovel pages 8-8). YES1 also participates in signaling pathways regulating immune cell migration; following T-cell activation by CXCL12, YES1 phosphorylates collapsin response mediator protein 2 (DPYSL2), thereby contributing to T-cell motility (clump2005cyesresponseto pages 6-7, kook2024emergingrolesof pages 8-10). Furthermore, YES1 phosphorylates organic cation transporter OCT2, enhancing its transport activity, and plays a role in CD95L/FASLG-mediated signaling leading to AKT activation, which in turn drives cell migration (clump2005cyesresponseto pages 7-8, garmendia2022yes1anovel pages 7-8). Tissue distribution studies indicate that YES1 is expressed in epithelial cells, neural tissues, and hematopoietic cells; its expression pattern is consistent with its diverse roles in processes such as cell adhesion, migration, and signal transduction (garmendia2022yes1anovel pages 1-2, kook2024emergingrolesof pages 1-2).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nA number of small-molecule inhibitors targeting multiple members of the Src family kinases have been developed, and some exhibit activity against YES1. For example, dasatinib is a multi-targeted inhibitor that suppresses YES1 activity with a low IC50 and has been used to demonstrate the therapeutic potential of targeting YES1 in cancers with its amplification (garmendia2022yes1anovel pages 6-7, kook2024emergingrolesof pages 7-8). More recently, efforts to develop selective YES1 inhibitors have led to compounds such as CH6953755, which shows potent inhibitory activity against YES1 with high selectivity relative to other SFKs in preclinical models. YES1 gene amplification and overexpression have been observed in several cancer types including esophageal, lung, head and neck, and bladder cancers, and these genetic alterations are associated with oncogene addiction, tumor progression, and resistance to conventional therapies (hamanaka2019yes1isa pages 1-2, hamanaka2019yes1isa pages 3-4). The oncogenic functions of YES1 – including its roles in promoting cell proliferation, facilitating cell migration through modulation of cytoskeletal components, and regulating cell survival – make it an attractive target for anticancer drug development (hamanaka2019yes1isa pages 10-11, hamanaka2019yes1isa pages 4-5). While extensive research has characterized the catalytic and regulatory mechanisms of YES1, further studies are warranted to fully detail its substrate specificity and the cooperativity with other kinases in different cellular contexts (summy2001functionaldomaincontributions pages 130-140, kook2024emergingrolesof pages 11-13).\n\n9.

B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling requires a tight regulation of several protein tyrosine kinases and phosphatases, and associated coreceptors (By similarity). Binding of antigen to the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) triggers signaling that ultimately leads to B-cell activation (By similarity). Signaling through BLK plays an important role in transmitting signals through surface immunoglobulins and supports the pro-B to pre-B transition, as well as the signaling for growth arrest and apoptosis downstream of B-cell receptor (By similarity). Specifically binds and phosphorylates CD79A at 'Tyr-188'and 'Tyr-199', as well as CD79B at 'Tyr-196' and 'Tyr-207' (By similarity). Also phosphorylates the immunoglobulin G receptors FCGR2A, FCGR2B and FCGR2C (PubMed:8756631). With FYN and LYN, plays an essential role in pre-B-cell receptor (pre-BCR)-mediated NF-kappa-B activation (By similarity). Also contributes to BTK activation by indirectly stimulating BTK intramolecular autophosphorylation (By similarity). In pancreatic islets, acts as a modulator of beta-cells function through the up-regulation of PDX1 and NKX6-1 and consequent stimulation of insulin secretion in response to glucose (PubMed:19667185). Phosphorylates CGAS, promoting retention of CGAS in the cytosol (PubMed:30356214)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase Blk (gene BLK), also known as B lymphocyte kinase or p55‐Blk, is classified as a non‐receptor tyrosine kinase belonging to the Src family, a well‐defined subgroup of the human tyrosine kinome. BLK and its orthologs are conserved across vertebrate species, with its expression predominantly detected in B lymphocytes of mammals; its presence in γδ T cells has additionally been reported (bhanumathy2021proteintyrosinekinases pages 1-2). Detailed kinome surveys by Manning et al. have demonstrated that the origin of the Src family dates back to early metazoans, and the evolutionary conservation of these kinases underscores their fundamental roles in immune receptor signaling (Manning et al., 2002, Science; Manning et al., 2002, Trends Biochem Sci; bhanumathy2021proteintyrosinekinases pages 1-2, cann2017identifyingtherapeuticagents pages 173-176, johnson2023anatlasof pages 1-2). Within the Src family, BLK clusters with kinases such as Fyn and Lyn that share modular domain architectures and significant sequence homology, thereby suggesting evolutionary relationships dedicated to the regulation of B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling (cann2017identifyingtherapeuticagents pages 173-176, johnson2023anatlasof pages 1-2). This phylogenetic framework establishes BLK as an evolutionarily ancient enzyme that has been maintained throughout vertebrate evolution due to its essential function in immune signal transduction (bhanumathy2021proteintyrosinekinases pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nBLK catalyzes the ATP‐dependent phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on target substrate proteins. The chemical reaction catalyzed by BLK can be formally represented as follows:  \nATP + [protein]‐L‐tyrosine → ADP + [protein]‐O‐phospho‐L‐tyrosine + H⁺ (yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 1-2). This reaction underpins the modulation of protein function by creating phosphotyrosine docking sites for downstream effector proteins, thereby initiating signaling cascades within the cell (xu2011crystalstructureof pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe enzymatic activity of BLK, like that of most tyrosine kinases, depends on the presence of divalent metal ions. In particular, BLK requires Mg²⁺ to facilitate proper binding of ATP in the active site, thereby stabilizing the negative charges on the phosphate groups and enabling efficient phosphotransfer onto the substrate tyrosine (xu2011crystalstructureof pages 1-2, yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 1-2, bhanumathy2021proteintyrosinekinases pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nBLK exhibits a defined substrate specificity characterized by its selective phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in proteins involved in B-cell receptor signaling. Experimentally, BLK phosphorylates CD79A at tyrosine residues 188 and 199 and CD79B at tyrosines 196 and 207, as well as immunoglobulin G receptors FCGR2A, FCGR2B, and FCGR2C (belle2017identificationofnew pages 61-64, bhanumathy2021proteintyrosinekinases pages 2-4). Intrinsic substrate specificity studies using combinatorial peptide arrays have established that BLK, similar to other tyrosine kinases, favors specific amino acid motifs surrounding the phosphoacceptor tyrosine; in particular, it shows a preference for acidic or hydrophobic residues located at defined positions relative to the target tyrosine (yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 12-15, johnson2023anatlasof pages 2-3). The consensus substrate motif recognized by BLK, while sharing common features with other Src family kinases, is critical for docking the substrate appropriately within the catalytic cleft to promote efficient phosphorylation (johnson2023anatlasof pages 2-3).\n\n5. Structure  \nBLK exhibits the canonical domain organization characteristic of Src family kinases. Its N-terminal region contains a unique sequence that encompasses an SH4 domain featuring a myristoylation signal, which is important for targeting the kinase to cellular membranes (cann2017identifyingtherapeuticagents pages 173-176, petsalakiUnknownyearthefestyrosine pages 26-31). Following the membrane-targeting region, BLK contains an SH3 domain responsible for binding proline-rich sequences in partner proteins and mediating specific protein–protein interactions. Adjacent to this is an SH2 domain that specializes in recognizing phosphotyrosine-containing motifs, thus facilitating the recruitment of signaling complexes (kothe2007structureofthe pages 3-4, johnson2023anatlasof pages 7-8). The C-terminal portion of BLK is occupied by the catalytic or kinase domain. This domain incorporates critical structural features such as the ATP-binding P-loop (glycine-rich loop), the catalytic loop, the activation loop (which undergoes phosphorylation to modulate activity), the C-helix necessary for proper active site geometry, and a hydrophobic spine that stabilizes the active conformation (cheek2005acomprehensiveupdate pages 18-19, yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 2-3, verba2016atomicstructureof pages 6-8). Although no unique structural feature exclusive to BLK has been identified, integrative analyses including AlphaFold predictions reveal that BLK conforms to the well-established bilobal structure observed in all protein kinases (johnson2023anatlasof pages 7-7, kothe2007structureofthe pages 3-4).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe activity of BLK is governed by regulatory mechanisms common to Src family kinases. Autophosphorylation within the activation loop of the catalytic domain enhances its kinase activity, while phosphorylation of a conserved C-terminal tyrosine residue contributes to an autoinhibitory conformation mediated by intramolecular binding of the SH2 domain (johnson2023anatlasof pages 7-7, yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 2-2). This autoinhibited state is maintained until appropriate extracellular signals, such as antigen engagement at the B-cell receptor, promote dephosphorylation of the inhibitory tyrosine by specific phosphatases, and concurrent phosphorylation of the activation loop (gough2024exploringtheconformational pages 10-11, johnson2023anatlasof pages 7-8). Moreover, BLK interacts with other kinases such as Fyn and Lyn within the BCR signaling complex, and these intermolecular interactions contribute to a tightly controlled signaling cascade (bhanumathy2021proteintyrosinekinases pages 2-4, cann2017identifyingtherapeuticagents pages 34-39). The combined effects of these phosphorylation events and protein-protein interactions ensure that BLK remains responsive to dynamic cellular cues (johnson2023anatlasof pages 8-9).\n\n7. Function  \nBLK is critically involved in B-cell physiology, participating in several key signaling pathways that determine B lymphocyte development, differentiation, and activation. Upon antigen binding to the B-cell receptor (BCR), BLK becomes activated and phosphorylates the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) present on the BCR-associated proteins CD79A and CD79B, thereby facilitating the recruitment of downstream effector proteins such as Syk kinase and initiating further propagation of the signal (belle2017identificationofnew pages 61-64, bhanumathy2021proteintyrosinekinases pages 2-4). In the context of pre-B-cell receptor (pre-BCR) signaling, BLK works alongside Fyn and Lyn to activate NF-κB, an essential transcription factor for lymphocyte survival and differentiation (cann2017identifyingtherapeuticagents pages 34-39, johnson2023anatlasof pages 2-3). In addition, BLK indirectly contributes to the activation of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) by promoting its autophosphorylation, thus amplifying proliferative and survival signals in B cells (cann2017identifyingtherapeuticagents pages 34-39, johnson2023anatlasof pages 2-3). Beyond its immunological role, BLK is expressed in pancreatic islets where it modulates beta-cell function. In these cells, BLK upregulates transcription factors such as PDX1 and NKX6-1, which are critical for insulin secretion in response to glucose (bhanumathy2021proteintyrosinekinases pages 2-4). Furthermore, BLK phosphorylates cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (CGAS), a process that promotes CGAS retention within the cytosol and thereby influences innate immune signaling (cann2017identifyingtherapeuticagents pages 39-43). These multiple roles underscore the importance of BLK in both adaptive immunity and metabolic regulation (kleinau2023theroleof pages 41-46).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nBLK has been identified as an essential kinase that supports B-cell viability, and due to its pivotal role in BCR signaling, it has garnered significant interest as a potential immunomodulatory target in B-cell malignancies such as lymphomas (belle2017identificationofnew pages 64-67, cann2017identifyingtherapeuticagents pages 51-54). Although no inhibitors have been designed exclusively for BLK, several Src family kinase inhibitors, including dasatinib and luxeptinib, have been demonstrated to affect signaling pathways in which BLK is involved (sonowal2023luxeptinibinterfereswith pages 14-15). In addition, dysregulation of BLK—potentially through genetic variants or altered post-translational modifications—has been genetically associated with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (barreiro2017functionalstudiesof pages 76-80). While specific disease-causing mutations in BLK have not been unequivocally characterized, the well-documented correlation of BLK expression levels and function with B-cell activation highlights its significance; therefore, continuing research may ultimately yield more selective inhibitors and novel therapeutic strategies targeting BLK (cheek2005acomprehensiveupdate pages 18-19, cann2017identifyingtherapeuticagents pages 51-54).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase HCK belongs to the Src family of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases, which is a highly conserved family present in all vertebrates and many eukaryotic organisms. HCK is evolutionarily related to other Src family kinases such as c‐Src, Lyn, Lck, Fyn, Fgr, Blk, Yes, and Yrk, and within the Src family it is often assigned to the SrcB subfamily, distinguished by its preferential expression in hematopoietic lineages (sicheri1997structuresofsrcfamily pages 1-2, banavali2007anatomyofa pages 1-2). Orthologs of HCK have been identified across mammalian species, and its conserved modular architecture—including the SH4, unique, SH3, SH2, catalytic kinase domain, and a C‐terminal regulatory tail—is emblematic of the evolutionary trajectory of this kinase family from a common eukaryotic ancestor (xu1997threedimensionalstructureof pages 7-8, yang2016hckisa pages 16-17).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nHCK catalyzes the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on substrate proteins by transferring the γ‐phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of a tyrosine residue. The overall chemical reaction can be represented as:  \nATP + Protein–L‑tyrosine → ADP + Protein–O‑phosphotyrosine + H⁺ (alvarado2010crystalstructureof pages 1-2, english1996expressionofthe pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of HCK is dependent on the presence of divalent metal cations, most notably Mg²⁺, which are essential for the proper binding of ATP in the catalytic site and for the phosphoryl transfer reaction (johnson2000modulationofthe pages 1-2, pond2020membraneanchoringof pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nHCK phosphorylates tyrosine residues in multiple substrate proteins, a function that is largely determined by both the catalytic kinase domain and the substrate-recruiting roles of its regulatory SH2 and SH3 domains. Its substrate repertoire includes proteins involved in signal transduction cascades in hematopoietic cells such as CBL, ADAM15, BCR, ELMO1, FCGR2A, GAB1, GAB2, RAPGEF1, STAT5B, TP73, VAV1, and WAS (alvarado2010crystalstructureof pages 1-2, corey1999srcrelatedproteintyrosine pages 10-11, yokoyama2005identificationoftyrosine pages 1-2). Although the precise consensus motif recognized by HCK has not been defined in detail within the provided sources, the intrinsic substrate specificity of Src family kinases suggests a preference for sequences that accommodate interactions with the active site as well as secondary contacts with the SH2/SH3 domains (yokoyama2005identificationoftyrosine pages 10-11, banavali2007anatomyofa pages 15-16).\n\n5. Structure  \nHCK displays a modular domain organization that underpins its function and regulation. At the N-terminus, HCK possesses an SH4 domain carrying signals for myristoylation and, in some isoforms, palmitoylation; these lipid modifications anchor the kinase to membranes, thereby facilitating interaction with membrane-bound receptors (pond2020membraneanchoringof pages 1-2). Adjacent to the SH4 domain is a unique region that is less conserved among Src family members yet contributes to isoform-specific functions—HCK is expressed in two major isoforms, commonly referred to as p59-HCK and p61-HCK, which differ by N-terminal residues and lipid modifications (english1996expressionofthe pages 1-2, gibson1993identificationcloningand pages 12-12). Following the unique region are the SH3 and SH2 domains; the SH3 domain binds to proline-rich polyproline type II helices typically found in the SH2-kinase interdomain linker, while the SH2 domain recognizes phosphorylated tyrosine motifs, including those present in the C-terminal tail of HCK (alvarado2010crystalstructureof pages 1-2, lerner2005activationofthe pages 1-2). The catalytic kinase domain, which occupies the central region of the protein, is bilobed and contains the highly conserved ATP-binding pocket, an activation loop that harbors the autophosphorylation site (analogous to Tyr416 in Src), and structural elements such as the glycine-rich loop, a critical C-helix, and a hydrophobic spine that are responsible for the enzyme’s catalytic activity and conformational switching between active and inactive states (selzer2024cocrystallizationofthe pages 1-2, sicheri1997structuresofsrcfamily pages 3-5). The C-terminal tail concludes the kinase and contains a regulatory tyrosine residue (Tyr501 in HCK, analogous to Tyr527 in c-Src) that, when phosphorylated, interacts intramolecularly with the SH2 domain to maintain the kinase in an autoinhibited conformation (alvarado2010crystalstructureof pages 1-2, lerner2005activationofthe pages 1-1, sicheri1997structuresofsrcfamily pages 6-8).\n\n6. Regulation  \nHCK is regulated through a finely tuned interplay of intramolecular domain interactions and phosphorylation events. In the autoinhibited state, the SH2 domain binds to a phosphorylated tyrosine in the C-terminal tail (Tyr501), and the SH3 domain binds to a proline-rich sequence found in the SH2-kinase linker; these interactions stabilize a conformation in which the catalytic domain is rendered inactive by displacement of the αC-helix and misalignment of critical catalytic residues (lerner2005activationofthe pages 1-2, sicheri1997structuresofsrcfamily pages 6-8). Full activation of HCK requires disruption of these inhibitory intramolecular interactions. Activation is achieved by displacement of the SH2 or SH3 contacts—such as through binding of external ligands (for example, the HIV-1 Nef protein is known to interact with the SH3 domain and activate HCK)—or through dephosphorylation of the inhibitory C-terminal tyrosine by phosphatases, resulting in a conformational change that permits autophosphorylation of the activation loop (Tyr416) and alignment of the ATP-binding pocket for catalysis (alvarado2010crystalstructureof pages 1-2, lerner2005activationofthe pages 6-7, johnson2000modulationofthe pages 7-8). In addition to these intramolecular events, regulatory kinases such as Csk and its homolog Chk phosphorylate the C-terminal tail to promote the inactive conformation, while intermolecular interactions and autophosphorylation events further modulate HCK’s catalytic output (advani2017cskhomologouskinase(chk) pages 8-10, johnson2000modulationofthe pages 2-2).\n\n7. Function  \nHCK is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells including neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and mast cells, where it plays an instrumental role in the regulation of innate immune responses. Acting downstream of cell surface receptors—which include Fcγ receptors (FCGR1A, FCGR2A), cytokine receptors such as those for IFNG, IL2, IL6, and IL8, as well as integrins (ITGB1 and ITGB2)—HCK transduces signals that regulate phagocytosis, cell adhesion, and migration (alvarado2010crystalstructureof pages 1-2, english1996expressionofthe pages 1-2). During phagocytosis, HCK is involved in mobilization of secretory lysosomes, degranulation, and activation of NADPH oxidase, which together contribute to the respiratory burst essential for microbial killing. Moreover, HCK phosphorylates a panel of substrates that includes CBL, ADAM15, BCR, ELMO1, GAB1, GAB2, RAPGEF1, STAT5B, TP73, VAV1, and WAS, thereby modulating downstream signaling pathways that affect cell survival, proliferation, and cytoskeletal reorganization (alvarado2010crystalstructureof pages 1-2, yokoyama2005identificationoftyrosine pages 10-11). In addition, HCK participates in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, facilitating podosome formation and membrane protrusion development, and it has been implicated in the inhibition of TP73-mediated transcription and apoptosis, thereby influencing cell fate decisions (klejman2002thesrcfamily pages 6-7, english1996expressionofthe pages 7-7).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nHCK is known by several alternative names including Hematopoietic cell kinase, p59-HCK/p60-HCK, and p61-HCK, reflecting the existence of multiple isoforms generated by alternative translational initiation (english1996expressionofthe pages 1-2, gibson1993identificationcloningand pages 12-12). Inhibitors that target Src family kinases, such as the ATP-competitive inhibitor A-419259 and derivative compounds like NaPP1 in chemical genetics studies, have been used to dissect the functional role of HCK in various signaling pathways, including its contribution to drug resistance in chronic myelogenous leukemia (penedumitrescu2008aninhibitorresistantmutant pages 2-4, penedumitrescu2010expressionofa pages 9-10). In particular, overexpression of HCK has been implicated in the resistance of CML cells to imatinib therapy by sustaining phosphorylation events that maintain downstream signaling through pathways such as those involving STAT5 and ERK (penedumitrescu2010expressionofa pages 5-6, penedumitrescu2010expressionofa pages 9-9). Furthermore, HCK inhibition is being explored as a therapeutic strategy in the context of certain hematopoietic malignancies and in HIV infection, where viral proteins such as Nef interact with its regulatory domains to dysregulate activity (alvarado2010crystalstructureof pages 1-2, lerner2005activationofthe pages 1-1). The structural basis of HCK’s activation by membrane anchoring and domain displacement, as revealed by crystallographic studies, also suggests unique sites for allosteric inhibition that may improve therapeutic selectivity (selzer2024cocrystallizationofthe pages 7-8).\n\n9.

Plays a key role in T-cell antigen receptor (TCR)-linked signal transduction pathways. Constitutively associated with the cytoplasmic portions of the CD4 and CD8 surface receptors. Association of the TCR with a peptide antigen-bound MHC complex facilitates the interaction of CD4 and CD8 with MHC class II and class I molecules, respectively, thereby recruiting the associated LCK protein to the vicinity of the TCR/CD3 complex. LCK then phosphorylates tyrosine residues within the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAM) of the cytoplasmic tails of the TCR-gamma chains and CD3 subunits, initiating the TCR/CD3 signaling pathway. Once stimulated, the TCR recruits the tyrosine kinase ZAP70, that becomes phosphorylated and activated by LCK. Following this, a large number of signaling molecules are recruited, ultimately leading to lymphokine production. LCK also contributes to signaling by other receptor molecules. Associates directly with the cytoplasmic tail of CD2, which leads to hyperphosphorylation and activation of LCK. Also plays a role in the IL2 receptor-linked signaling pathway that controls the T-cell proliferative response. Binding of IL2 to its receptor results in increased activity of LCK. Is expressed at all stages of thymocyte development and is required for the regulation of maturation events that are governed by both pre-TCR and mature alpha beta TCR. Phosphorylates other substrates including RUNX3, PTK2B/PYK2, the microtubule-associated protein MAPT, RHOH or TYROBP.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase Lck (LCK) is a member of the Src family kinases (SFKs), a group of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases that share a conserved modular architecture and can be traced to the common ancestor of metazoans. Lck is expressed predominantly in T lymphocytes and natural killer cells, and orthologs exist throughout all jawed vertebrates, reflecting its essential role in adaptive immunity (hans1996srcfamilykinases pages 25-29). Within the Src family, Lck is most closely related to kinases such as Fyn, Yes, and Src itself, all of which contain the characteristic N‐terminal lipid modification sequence, an SH3 domain that binds proline‐rich motifs, an SH2 domain which recognizes phosphotyrosine substrates, a flexible linker region, and a conserved catalytic kinase domain (korademirnics2000srckinasemediatedsignaling pages 1-2, hans1996srcfamilykinases pages 25-29). Evolutionary investigations have indicated that the SFKs arose very early during eukaryotic evolution; in vertebrates, gene duplication and subsequent specialization have yielded distinct family members. Lck in particular appears to have acquired unique regulatory and targeting features required for its association with the CD4 and CD8 coreceptors, features that distinguish it from its ubiquitously expressed relatives (corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 13-16, hans1996srcfamilykinases pages 25-29).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nLck catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to tyrosine residues on substrate proteins. The general chemical reaction it mediates can be described as: ATP + [protein]-L-tyrosine → ADP + [protein]-phosphotyrosine + H⁺. This enzymatic activity is central to initiating T cell receptor (TCR) signaling cascades, for example by phosphorylating immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) on CD3 subunits and the TCR ζ-chain, events that are necessary for subsequent recruitment and activation of kinases such as ZAP-70 (zhu1999structuralanalysisof pages 1-2, borowicz2020regulationoft pages 75-77).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nLck requires divalent metal ions for its catalytic activity. Most prominently, magnesium (Mg²⁺) is essential as a cofactor, as it facilitates the binding and proper positioning of ATP within the kinase domain’s active site during phosphotransfer reactions (zhu1999structuralanalysisof pages 1-2, hans1996srcfamilykinases pages 25-29).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nThe substrate specificity of Lck has been characterized by its intrinsic preference for tyrosine residues that are present in defined sequence contexts. In T cells, Lck phosphorylates specific tyrosines within the ITAM motifs of the TCR/CD3 complex, and in vitro studies indicate that its substrate recognition is influenced by both the primary amino acid sequence surrounding the phosphorylated tyrosine and by docking interactions mediated by its SH2 and SH3 domains (singh2018explorationofthe pages 2-3, talab2013lckisan pages 1-2). Moreover, high-throughput specificity screens of the human tyrosine kinome have revealed that the consensus substrate motifs for tyrosine kinases like Lck include particular hydrophobic and basic residues that flank the target tyrosine, allowing selective phosphorylation of substrates such as ZAP-70, LAT, and other adaptors (singh2018explorationofthe pages 3-5, Yaron-Barir et al. 2024 – see valid key instructions).\n\n5. Structure  \nLck is organized into several distinct domains that contribute to its catalytic function and regulatory interactions. The N-terminal region contains lipid modification sites including a myristoylation consensus sequence at glycine 2 and palmitoylation sites at cysteines (e.g., Cys-3 and Cys-5), which mediate its association with the plasma membrane and help localize it to specific membrane microdomains (palacios2004functionofthe pages 2-3, hans1996srcfamilykinases pages 25-29). Adjacent to this unique N-terminal anchor is the SH3 domain, which facilitates interactions with proline-rich sequences in partner proteins and is critical for both intramolecular regulation and intermolecular signaling complex formation (zhu1999structuralanalysisof pages 7-8, sanctis2024lckfunctionand pages 2-4). Next, the SH2 domain binds phosphotyrosine-containing motifs and plays a key role in substrate recognition as well as in the regulation of Lck’s conformation; for instance, binding of the phosphorylated Tyr505 in its own tail to the SH2 domain results in a closed, inactive conformation (borowicz2020regulationoft pages 20-24, hans1996srcfamilykinases pages 25-29). The central catalytic (kinase) domain contains the typical bilobal structure with an N-terminal lobe rich in β-sheets and a C-terminal lobe dominated by α-helices; the active site is located in the cleft between these lobes, where ATP binds and the activation loop—containing the critical autophosphorylation site Tyr394—undergoes conformational changes upon activation (zhu1999structuralanalysisof pages 8-9, sanctis2024lckfunctionand pages 6-8). Unique structural features include a flexible linker region that integrates signals from the SH2 and SH3 domains to modulate catalytic activity and a regulatory C-terminal tail that contains Tyr505, a key inhibitory phosphorylation site (borowicz2020regulationoft pages 73-75, zhu1999structuralanalysisof pages 11-11).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of Lck involves multiple, interdependent mechanisms that finely tune its kinase activity. A critical regulatory feature is the phosphorylation status of key tyrosine residues. Autophosphorylation at Tyr394 within the activation loop stabilizes an open, active conformation of the kinase and is necessary for full catalytic activity (zhu1999structuralanalysisof pages 1-2, hans1996srcfamilykinases pages 25-29). In contrast, phosphorylation at Tyr505 by the C-terminal Src kinase (CSK) promotes a closed conformation by enabling intramolecular binding of this phosphotyrosine to the SH2 domain, thereby inhibiting kinase activity (borowicz2020regulationoft pages 15-20, palacios2004functionofthe pages 3-4). Additionally, phosphorylation at Tyr192 within the SH2 domain modulates the association of Lck with regulatory phosphatases such as CD45; phosphorylation at this site is thought to inhibit CD45-mediated dephosphorylation of Tyr505, further sustaining the inactive conformation (borowicz2020regulationoft pages 73-75, sanctis2024lckfunctionand pages 13-14). Lck is also regulated by its association with adaptor proteins, such as TSAd, which interact with its SH2 domain and modulate downstream signaling pathways; TSAd binding and its own phosphorylation status (e.g., at Tyr290 on TSAd) influence Lck’s activity and its recruitment to signaling complexes (borowicz2020regulationoft pages 63-66, borowicz2020regulationoft pages 77-79). In addition to these phosphorylation events, reversible lipid modifications – myristoylation and palmitoylation – are essential for maintaining proper membrane localization, which is a prerequisite for Lck function in TCR signaling (palacios2004functionofthe pages 2-3, hans1996srcfamilykinases pages 25-29).\n\n7. Function  \nLck plays a central role in T cell receptor-mediated signal transduction and is critical for both the selection and maturation of developing T cells in the thymus as well as for the function of mature T cells. It is constitutively associated with the cytoplasmic regions of the CD4 and CD8 co-receptors, and upon engagement of the TCR with peptide-bound major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, Lck is recruited to the TCR/CD3 complex where it phosphorylates ITAM motifs present on the CD3 and ζ chains (borowicz2020regulationoft pages 1-7, hans1996srcfamilykinases pages 25-29). This initial phosphorylation event creates docking sites for the tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 which, once phosphorylated and activated by Lck, catalyzes downstream signaling events that result in lymphokine production and T cell activation (zhu1999structuralanalysisof pages 1-2, sanctis2024lckfunctionand pages 20-21). In addition to its canonical role in TCR signaling, Lck also interacts directly with other receptor molecules such as CD2 and components of the interleukin-2 receptor (IL2R) signaling complex, where it contributes to the regulation of T cell proliferative responses (borowicz2020regulationoft pages 24-29, hans1996srcfamilykinases pages 25-29). Expression of Lck is maintained throughout thymocyte development and in mature T cells, where its proper regulation is essential not only for signal initiation but also for the spatial and temporal organization of downstream signaling complexes (till2017lckisa pages 1-2, palacios2004functionofthe pages 3-4). Its substrates include not only the ITAM-containing TCR subunits but also other signaling molecules such as the adaptor protein LAT, the kinase ZAP-70, and additional substrates like RUNX3, PTK2B/PYK2, and RHOH, thereby influencing diverse cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (borowicz2020regulationoft pages 75-77, talab2013lckisan pages 14-15).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nLck has become an important target for pharmacological intervention in contexts where modulation of T cell activity may be beneficial. Several tyrosine kinase inhibitors – including imatinib and dasatinib – have demonstrated the capacity to inhibit Lck activity, leading to decreased phosphorylation of its downstream substrates, reduced IL-2 secretion, and modulation of T cell activation markers (lee2010lckisa pages 2-3, sanctis2024lckfunctionand pages 16-18). In addition, selective small-molecule inhibitors that target the ATP-binding site of Lck as well as compounds that affect its regulatory mechanisms (for example, by interfering with its lipid modifications) have been explored as potential immunosuppressive agents (zhu1999structuralanalysisof pages 7-8, singh2018explorationofthe pages 5-6). Disease associations for Lck include its involvement in immunodeficiency syndromes when loss-of-function mutations occur, as well as in oncogenic processes such as T cell leukemias and chronic lymphocytic leukemia where aberrant Lck activity or expression is observed (keller2024combinedimmunodeficiencycaused pages 15-15, talab2013lckisan pages 1-2). Abnormal Lck signaling is also implicated in autoimmune disorders, and genetic studies have linked polymorphisms in Lck-regulatory pathways to diseases such as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. In experimental models, manipulation of Lck activity – either through genetic knockouts or pharmacological inhibition – has provided insight into its role in T cell development and immune regulation (borowicz2020regulationoft pages 73-75, korademirnics2000srckinasemediatedsignaling pages 1-2). As an established proto-oncogene in the lymphoid compartment, Lck remains a focus of research both as a potential therapeutic target and as a tool to better understand the fine-tuning of T cell receptor-mediated signaling (laganz2024anovelbiallelic pages 14-15, sanctis2024lckfunctionand pages 18-20).\n\n9.

Functions primarily as negative regulator, but can also function as activator, depending on the context. Required for the initiation of the B-cell response, but also for its down-regulation and termination. Plays an important role in the regulation of B-cell differentiation, proliferation, survival and apoptosis, and is important for immune self-tolerance. Acts downstream of several immune receptors, including the B-cell receptor, CD79A, CD79B, CD5, CD19, CD22, FCER1, FCGR2, FCGR1A, TLR2 and TLR4. Plays a role in the inflammatory response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Mediates the responses to cytokines and growth factors in hematopoietic progenitors, platelets, erythrocytes, and in mature myeloid cells, such as dendritic cells, neutrophils and eosinophils. Acts downstream of EPOR, KIT, MPL, the chemokine receptor CXCR4, as well as the receptors for IL3, IL5 and CSF2. Plays an important role in integrin signaling. Regulates cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, migration, adhesion, degranulation, and cytokine release. Involved in the regulation of endothelial activation, neutrophil adhesion and transendothelial migration (PubMed:36932076). Down-regulates signaling pathways by phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIM), that then serve as binding sites for phosphatases, such as PTPN6/SHP-1, PTPN11/SHP-2 and INPP5D/SHIP-1, that modulate signaling by dephosphorylation of kinases and their substrates. Phosphorylates LIME1 in response to CD22 activation. Phosphorylates BTK, CBL, CD5, CD19, CD72, CD79A, CD79B, CSF2RB, DOK1, HCLS1, LILRB3/PIR-B, MS4A2/FCER1B, SYK and TEC. Promotes phosphorylation of SIRPA, PTPN6/SHP-1, PTPN11/SHP-2 and INPP5D/SHIP-1. Mediates phosphorylation of the BCR-ABL fusion protein. Required for rapid phosphorylation of FER in response to FCER1 activation. Mediates KIT phosphorylation. Acts as an effector of EPOR (erythropoietin receptor) in controlling KIT expression and may play a role in erythroid differentiation during the switch between proliferation and maturation. Depending on the context, activates or inhibits several signaling cascades. Regulates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity and AKT1 activation. Regulates activation of the MAP kinase signaling cascade, including activation of MAP2K1/MEK1, MAPK1/ERK2, MAPK3/ERK1, MAPK8/JNK1 and MAPK9/JNK2. Mediates activation of STAT5A and/or STAT5B. Phosphorylates LPXN on 'Tyr-72'. Kinase activity facilitates TLR4-TLR6 heterodimerization and signal initiation. Phosphorylates SCIMP on 'Tyr-107'; this enhances binding of SCIMP to TLR4, promoting the phosphorylation of TLR4, and a selective cytokine response to lipopolysaccharide in macrophages (By similarity). Phosphorylates CLNK (By similarity). Phosphorylates BCAR1/CAS and NEDD9/HEF1 (PubMed:9020138)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase Lyn is a member of the Src family kinases (SFKs), which comprise a conserved group of non‐receptor protein tyrosine kinases found in virtually all metazoans. Within the human kinome, Lyn is classified in the Lyn‐related subfamily that also includes kinases such as Hck, Lck, and Blk. Orthologs of Lyn exist across vertebrate species, and sequence comparisons reveal that its domain architecture and regulatory motifs are conserved among mammals, birds, and lower vertebrates. This conservation underscores the ancient origin of Src family kinases that can be traced back to a common ancestor of eukaryotes, as demonstrated by protein kinase complement analyses in human and other species (ingley2008srcfamilykinases pages 1-2, korademirnics2000srckinasemediatedsignaling pages 2-3).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase Lyn catalyzes the phosphorylation reaction that transfers the γ‐phosphate from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to a specific tyrosine residue on a protein substrate. In chemical terms, the reaction is:  \n  ATP + protein – OH (tyrosine) → ADP + protein – O‐PO₃²⁻ (phosphotyrosine) + H⁺.  \nThis reaction is critical for regulating the functional state of its substrates by modifying their conformation, stability, and interaction properties (ingley2008srcfamilykinases pages 8-9).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of Lyn, like that of most protein kinases, is dependent on the presence of divalent cations; in particular, Mg²⁺ acts as a crucial cofactor for the coordination of ATP within the active site of the kinase domain. This Mg²⁺ dependency ensures proper positioning of ATP for the efficient transfer of the phosphate group to the target tyrosine residue on substrate proteins (huang2010structurefunctionstudiesof pages 21-27).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase Lyn exhibits a broad substrate specificity that is central to its role in immune cell signaling. The kinase phosphorylates a diverse array of substrates, primarily within signaling cascades triggered by immune receptors. For example, Lyn phosphorylates proteins such as Cbp/PAG1 on specific tyrosine residues—most notably at Tyr314—which in turn facilitates the recruitment of negative regulators like SOCS1 to promote subsequent polyubiquitination and degradation of Lyn. In addition, Lyn phosphorylates key components of immune receptor complexes including parts of the B‐cell receptor (BCR) complex (CD79A, CD79B) and other substrates such as BTK, CD5, and SYK. While the precise consensus phosphorylation motif for Lyn has not been unambiguously isolated in the texts provided, analyses of the intrinsic substrate specificity of Src family tyrosine kinases indicate a preference for motifs featuring specific surrounding amino acids adjacent to the target tyrosine. In cell‐based and in vitro systems, Lyn has demonstrated selectivity for phosphorylating motifs within immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) and inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), contributing to both the activation and down‐regulation of signaling pathways (ingley2008srcfamilykinases pages 7-8, korademirnics2000srckinasemediatedsignaling pages 11-11, corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 146-149).\n\n5. Structure  \nThe three-dimensional organization of Lyn is emblematic of the Src family kinases. Its overall structure can be divided into several distinct domains that coordinate its catalytic activity and regulatory functions.  \n • The N-terminal region contains a unique domain that is distinct among SFKs. This region typically undergoes co‐translational myristoylation and, in many instances, further palmitoylation. These lipid modifications serve to target Lyn to specific areas of the plasma membrane, such as lipid rafts—microdomains that are enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids—which are pivotal for organizing and amplifying signal transduction (ingley2008srcfamilykinases pages 1-2, ubau2013functionalcharacterizationof pages 18-21).  \n • Following the unique domain is the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, which binds to proline-rich sequences in interacting proteins. This interaction not only aids in the assembly of multi-protein signaling complexes but also plays a key role in maintaining the inactive conformation of the kinase by interacting with parts of the linker region (korademirnics2000srckinasemediatedsignaling pages 2-3).  \n • The Src homology 2 (SH2) domain comes next and specifically binds to phosphotyrosine-containing motifs. In Lyn, the SH2 domain is crucial for mediating intramolecular autoinhibitory interactions—as well as for recognizing and binding to phosphorylated substrates during signaling (ingley2008srcfamilykinases pages 2-3, korademirnics2000srckinasemediatedsignaling pages 2-3).  \n • At the C-terminal is the catalytic kinase domain, also known as the SH1 domain. This domain consists of a typical bilobal structure—an N-terminal lobe that binds ATP and a larger C-terminal lobe that binds substrate peptides. The kinase domain contains an activation loop whose phosphorylation (autophosphorylation on a tyrosine residue analogous to Tyr416 in c-Src) is required for full enzymatic activity. In addition, a conserved C-terminal tyrosine (for Lyn, often referred to in parallel with the inhibitory phosphorylation site in c-Src, for instance Tyr508) plays a critical role in maintaining an inactive state through intramolecular interaction with the SH2 domain (ingley2008srcfamilykinases pages 7-8, korademirnics2000srckinasemediatedsignaling pages 3-4).  \nWhile no Lyn-specific high-resolution crystal structure is detailed in the provided texts, its structure is assumed to be highly similar to other well-characterized SFKs, which have been elucidated by X-ray crystallography and supported by AlphaFold models (ingley2008srcfamilykinases pages 8-9, huang2010structurefunctionstudiesof pages 27-33).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulatory mechanisms governing Lyn kinase activity are multifactorial and involve several post-translational modifications as well as interactions with regulatory proteins.  \n • Phosphorylation is a primary form of regulation. Autophosphorylation of the activation loop tyrosine within the kinase domain results in a conformational change that opens the catalytic cleft and enhances kinase activity. Conversely, phosphorylation of a conserved C-terminal tyrosine (analogous to Tyr527 in Src and corresponding to Tyr508 in Lyn) by kinases such as C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) or Csk-homologous kinases imposes an inactive conformation by promoting intramolecular binding of the phosphotyrosine to the SH2 domain (ingley2008srcfamilykinases pages 7-8, chong2005endogenousandsynthetic pages 11-11).  \n • Adaptor and scaffold proteins also critically modulate Lyn function. Csk binding protein (Cbp/PAG1), which is itself palmitoylated and localized to lipid rafts, serves to recruit Csk to the plasma membrane where Lyn is positioned. The resulting Lyn–Cbp–Csk complex facilitates inhibitory phosphorylation of Lyn’s C-terminal tail, effectively acting as a negative feedback loop to down-regulate signaling (ingley2008srcfamilykinases pages 7-8, korademirnics2000srckinasemediatedsignaling pages 2-3).  \n • Reversible lipid modifications such as N-terminal myristoylation and palmitoylation are essential for Lyn’s correct subcellular localization. This membrane targeting not only brings Lyn into proximity with its substrates but also influences its regulatory interactions with both kinases and phosphatases (ubau2013functionalcharacterizationof pages 18-21, huang2010structurefunctionstudiesof pages 21-27).  \n • Ubiquitination is another regulatory mechanism by which Lyn levels are controlled post-activation. Following activation, Lyn may become polyubiquitinated by E3 ubiquitin ligases such as Cbl and SOCS1, marking it for proteasomal degradation and thus terminating its signaling activity (ingley2008srcfamilykinases pages 7-8, ubau2013functionalcharacterizationof pages 89-91).  \nThe combined actions of these phosphorylation events, lipid modifications, and protein–protein interactions result in a finely balanced system that rapidly toggles Lyn between active and inactive states in response to upstream receptor signals.\n\n7. Function  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase Lyn is widely recognized for its multifaceted roles in cellular signal transduction, particularly within the hematopoietic and immune systems.  \n • Expression Profile: Lyn is predominantly expressed in cells of hematopoietic origin including B-lymphocytes, T-lymphocytes, myeloid cells (such as neutrophils and eosinophils), dendritic cells, and in certain non-hematopoietic cell types like endothelial cells. The expression pattern supports its key roles in both innate and adaptive immunity (ingley2008srcfamilykinases pages 9-10, korademirnics2000srckinasemediatedsignaling pages 1-2).  \n • Immune Receptor Signaling: In B cells, Lyn is required for the initiation of signaling downstream of the B-cell receptor (BCR). It phosphorylates critical tyrosine residues present within the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) of components such as CD79A and CD79B, thereby promoting the recruitment and activation of downstream signaling proteins like SYK. In parallel, Lyn phosphorylates immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) on receptors engaged during B-cell downregulation, and these phosphorylated motifs then serve as docking sites for phosphatases such as SHP-1, SHP-2, and SHIP-1, which participate in signal termination and maintenance of immune self-tolerance (ingley2008srcfamilykinases pages 9-10, korademirnics2000srckinasemediatedsignaling pages 10-11).  \n • Cytokine and Growth Factor Responses: Beyond its role in B-cell receptor signaling, Lyn acts downstream of various cytokine and growth factor receptors (for example, EPOR, KIT, and receptors for IL-3, IL-5, and CSF2). In hematopoietic progenitors as well as mature blood cells, Lyn transduces signals that regulate cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. The kinase is also implicated in the regulation of integrin signaling pathways, mediating cell adhesion, migration, and degranulation in immune cells such as neutrophils and dendritic cells (mccarthy2017kinaseinhibitorsand pages 49-52, ingley2008srcfamilykinases pages 9-10).  \n • Oncogenic and Genotoxic Responses: Lyn has been associated with responses to DNA damage and genotoxic stress, and its activity has been reported to mediate aspects of apoptosis as well as survival signals. Moreover, Lyn contributes to oncogenic signaling through its involvement in the phosphorylation of fusion proteins such as BCR-ABL, a hallmark of certain leukemias. Aberrant expression or mislocalization of Lyn has been observed in various hematological malignancies, underscoring its dual role as both a positive and negative regulator of signal transduction (ubau2013functionalcharacterizationof pages 70-73, korademirnics2000srckinasemediatedsignaling pages 11-11).  \n • Integrin and Adhesion Signaling: Lyn also plays a significant role in integrin-mediated signaling, where it contributes to the regulation of cell spreading, adhesion, and migration. During integrin engagement, Lyn is transiently activated and participates in the phosphorylation of cytoskeletal components and focal adhesion proteins, a function that is essential during immune cell trafficking and endothelial activation (mccarthy2017kinaseinhibitorsand pages 52-56, korademirnics2000srckinasemediatedsignaling pages 7-8).  \nCollectively, these roles illustrate that Lyn functions as an essential signal transducer bridging receptor engagement at the plasma membrane with intracellular pathways that regulate immune responses, hematopoietic cell fate, and cellular homeostasis.\n\n8. Other Comments  \nExperimental inhibitors of Src family kinases such as PP2 and SU6656 have been employed to glean insights into Lyn function. Although these compounds target multiple members of the SFK family, their application has contributed significantly to our understanding of Lyn’s role in regulating immune cell signaling and oncogenic processes (mccarthy2017kinaseinhibitorsand pages 52-56, soussou2000characterizationoftwo pages 35-40). Lyn misregulation and aberrant localization have been linked with various hematological malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia, and may contribute to immune dysregulation by disrupting the balance between activating and inhibitory receptor signals. In addition, laboratory studies have demonstrated that RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Lyn in leukemic cell lines results in diminished downstream signaling through pathways such as the PI3K/AKT and MAP kinase cascades, providing a rationale for therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting Lyn in certain cancers (ubau2013functionalcharacterizationof pages 70-73, ubau2013functionalcharacterizationof pages 68-70). Overall, the available data indicate that Lyn acts as both an initiator and a modulator of key signal transduction pathways; its proper regulation by phosphorylation, lipid modifications, and protein turnover is critical for maintaining normal immunological responses as well as for preventing oncogenic transformation.\n\n9.

Coordinates actin remodeling through tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins controlling cytoskeleton dynamics like WASF3 (involved in branch formation); ANXA1 (involved in membrane anchoring); DBN1, DBNL, CTTN, RAPH1 and ENAH (involved in signaling); or MAPT and PXN (microtubule-binding proteins). Phosphorylation of WASF3 is critical for the stimulation of lamellipodia formation and cell migration. Involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and motility through phosphorylation of key regulators of these processes such as BCAR1, CRK, CRKL, DOK1, EFS or NEDD9 (PubMed:22810897). Phosphorylates multiple receptor tyrosine kinases and more particularly promotes endocytosis of EGFR, facilitates the formation of neuromuscular synapses through MUSK, inhibits PDGFRB-mediated chemotaxis and modulates the endocytosis of activated B-cell receptor complexes. Other substrates which are involved in endocytosis regulation are the caveolin (CAV1) and RIN1. Moreover, ABL1 regulates the CBL family of ubiquitin ligases that drive receptor down-regulation and actin remodeling. Phosphorylation of CBL leads to increased EGFR stability. Involved in late-stage autophagy by regulating positively the trafficking and function of lysosomal components. ABL1 targets to mitochondria in response to oxidative stress and thereby mediates mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. In response to oxidative stress, phosphorylates serine/threonine kinase PRKD2 at 'Tyr-717' (PubMed:28428613). ABL1 is also translocated in the nucleus where it has DNA-binding activity and is involved in DNA-damage response and apoptosis. Many substrates are known mediators of DNA repair: DDB1, DDB2, ERCC3, ERCC6, RAD9A, RAD51, RAD52 or WRN. Activates the proapoptotic pathway when the DNA damage is too severe to be repaired. Phosphorylates TP73, a primary regulator for this type of damage-induced apoptosis. Phosphorylates the caspase CASP9 on 'Tyr-153' and regulates its processing in the apoptotic response to DNA damage. Phosphorylates PSMA7 that leads to an inhibition of proteasomal activity and cell cycle transition blocks. ABL1 also acts as a regulator of multiple pathological signaling cascades during infection. Several known tyrosine-phosphorylated microbial proteins have been identified as ABL1 substrates. This is the case of A36R of Vaccinia virus, Tir (translocated intimin receptor) of pathogenic E.coli and possibly Citrobacter, CagA (cytotoxin-associated gene A) of H.pylori, or AnkA (ankyrin repeat-containing protein A) of A.phagocytophilum. Pathogens can highjack ABL1 kinase signaling to reorganize the host actin cytoskeleton for multiple purposes, like facilitating intracellular movement and host cell exit. Finally, functions as its own regulator through autocatalytic activity as well as through phosphorylation of its inhibitor, ABI1. Regulates T-cell differentiation in a TBX21-dependent manner (By similarity). Positively regulates chemokine-mediated T-cell migration, polarization, and homing to lymph nodes and immune-challenged tissues, potentially via activation of NEDD9/HEF1 and RAP1 (By similarity). Phosphorylates TBX21 on tyrosine residues leading to an enhancement of its transcriptional activator activity (By similarity)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase ABL1 belongs to the Abl family of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases that are evolutionarily conserved across metazoans, with orthologs ranging from simple invertebrates to higher vertebrates. In vertebrates, gene duplication early in evolution gave rise to two paralogs, ABL1 and ABL2 (also known as Arg), that share a highly conserved N‐terminal SRC cassette composed of SH3, SH2, and catalytic (tyrosine kinase) domains; however, ABL1 has subsequently evolved additional domains such as nuclear localization signals and a DNA binding region that are not present in ABL2. Comparative analyses have demonstrated that the catalytic core and regulatory domains of ABL1 are conserved among mammalian species, reflecting its essential roles in cellular signaling pathways. Detailed phylogenetic studies indicate that the ancestral Abl kinase, which can be traced back to early eukaryotes, underwent diversification through gene duplication events in the vertebrate lineage, resulting in specialized functions for ABL1 versus ABL2 that are evident by differences in their subcellular localization and interaction partners (colicelli2010abltyrosinekinases pages 13-15, colicelli2010abltyrosinekinases pages 27-36).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nABL1 catalyzes the transfer of the γ-phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the hydroxyl group of tyrosine residues on protein substrates. In chemical terms, the reaction can be summarized as follows: ATP + [protein]-tyrosine → ADP + [protein]-phosphotyrosine + H⁺. This phosphorylation event is critical for transmitting cellular signals that regulate diverse physiological processes (colicelli2010abltyrosinekinases pages 1-2, walz2008comparisonofmutated pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nFor its catalytic activity, ABL1 requires divalent metal ions, specifically magnesium ions (Mg²⁺), which facilitate proper binding of ATP and support the phosphotransfer reaction. The presence of Mg²⁺ is integral to achieving the correct conformation of the active site and enabling efficient catalysis (walz2008comparisonofmutated pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nThe intrinsic substrate specificity of ABL1 reflects its preference for phosphorylating tyrosine residues located within particular amino acid motifs. Studies have elucidated that ABL1 preferentially targets sites that conform to a consensus motif, often described as YxxPP, where “Y” is the tyrosine phosphorylation acceptor and “x” represents any amino acid, while the two proline residues (PP) serve as key determinants for substrate docking. This motif facilitates stable interactions by aligning the substrate for processive phosphorylation events through cooperative binding of the ABL1 SH2 and SH3 domains, which recognize phosphotyrosine and proline‐rich sequences respectively (mayro2022thecharacterizationofa pages 24-29, greuber2013roleofabl pages 2-4).\n\n5. Structure  \nABL1 is organized into multiple functional domains that contribute collectively to its regulatory and catalytic activities. At the extreme N-terminus, ABL1 possesses a cap region that includes a myristoylation site; in isoform 1b, the myristoylated glycine residue is critical for engaging a hydrophobic pocket in the kinase domain and maintaining an autoinhibited state. Immediately following the cap are the SH3 and SH2 domains; the SH3 domain binds to proline-rich sequences while the SH2 domain mediates interactions with phosphotyrosine-containing peptides, thereby contributing to substrate specificity and intramolecular regulation. Central to the protein is the catalytic or tyrosine kinase (SH1) domain, which is composed of a bilobal structure with an N-terminal lobe that primarily binds ATP and a larger C-terminal lobe that supports substrate binding. Within the kinase domain, a long activation loop contains critical residues such as Y412, whose phosphorylation is essential for full catalytic activation, while Y245 in the SH2–kinase linker modulates the enzyme’s activity by controlling the accessibility of the catalytic cleft. Downstream from the catalytic core, ABL1 contains a non-conserved C-terminal region that includes nuclear localization signals (NLS) and a nuclear export signal (NES), allowing precise subcellular targeting between the cytosol and nucleus. Additional interaction motifs, such as proline-rich (PXXP) regions, facilitate binding of regulatory partners like ABI1, which further modulate its activity (colicelli2010abltyrosinekinases pages 10-12, colicelli2010abltyrosinekinases pages 36-37, jones2020allostericinhibitionof pages 1-5, mayro2022thecharacterizationofa pages 29-34).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of ABL1 is multifaceted and occurs through various post-translational modifications as well as through intramolecular and intermolecular interactions. A key regulatory mechanism is autoinhibition mediated by the binding of the N-terminal myristoylated segment to a hydrophobic pocket in the kinase domain; this interaction, together with the stable SH3-SH2 clamp, maintains the kinase in an inactive conformation until proper activation signals are received. Phosphorylation of regulatory tyrosine residues—most notably Y245 within the SH2–kinase linker and Y412 within the activation loop—is essential for transitioning ABL1 from an autoinhibited to an active state; phosphorylation at these sites disrupts the autoinhibitory interactions and repositions the activation loop to permit substrate access (colicelli2010abltyrosinekinases pages 12-13, mayro2022thecharacterizationofa pages 29-34). In addition, ABL1 is subject to further regulation through serine/threonine phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination; these modifications can influence its subcellular localization, stability, and overall catalytic efficiency. For example, ubiquitination of ABL1 targets it for proteasomal degradation and serves as a mechanism to limit excessive kinase activity, while interactions with negative regulators such as ABI1 provide feedback inhibition through phosphorylation-dependent conformational changes (colicelli2010abltyrosinekinases pages 4-5, greuber2013roleofabl pages 11-12, siveen2018roleofnon pages 2-4).\n\n7. Function  \nABL1 plays a central role in a multitude of cellular processes by acting as an integrator of extracellular and intracellular signals. One of its primary functions involves the dynamic regulation of the actin cytoskeleton; through phosphorylation of key proteins such as WASF3, DBN1, DBNL, CTTN, RAPH1, and ENAH, ABL1 orchestrates the remodeling of actin filaments, thereby promoting lamellipodia formation, cell migration, and adhesion. In addition to its cytoskeletal functions, ABL1 is critically involved in receptor endocytosis—mediating the phosphorylation of receptors such as EGFR and modulating the activity of adaptor proteins (e.g., CAV1, RIN1, and the CBL family of ubiquitin ligases) to influence receptor stability and signaling turnover. In the context of autophagy, ABL1 regulates the trafficking and function of lysosomal components, thereby ensuring the proper turnover of cellular constituents during stress conditions. Under oxidative stress, ABL1 translocates to mitochondria where it phosphorylates factors such as PRKD2, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and, ultimately, cell death. ABL1 is also active within the nucleus, where its DNA-binding capability and phosphorylation of substrates involved in the DNA damage response—including DDB1, DDB2, ERCC3, ERCC6, RAD51, RAD52, WRN, and TP73—contribute to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis when DNA damage is irreparable. Beyond these roles, ABL1 regulates the function of caspases through phosphorylation (e.g., CASP9 on Tyr-153) and impacts the proteasome through modification of components like PSMA7, thereby affecting cell cycle progression. In immune cells, ABL1 contributes to T-cell differentiation, chemokine-mediated migration, and polarization, potentially through the phosphorylation of transcription factors such as TBX21 and adaptor proteins like NEDD9 (colicelli2010abltyrosinekinases pages 10-12, colicelli2010abltyrosinekinases pages 16-17, greuber2013roleofabl pages 14-15, tripathi2018enablingtumorgrowth pages 9-10).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nABL1 is widely recognized as a proto-oncogene; its dysregulation is most famously exemplified by the BCR–ABL1 fusion protein found in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome–positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which arise from chromosomal translocations that remove inhibitory regulatory domains and confer constitutive kinase activity. In addition, aberrant ABL1 signaling has been implicated in various solid tumors, where its role in modulating cytoskeletal dynamics, receptor endocytosis, and DNA damage responses can contribute to cancer progression and metastasis. A wide array of inhibitors targeting ABL1 has been developed, including ATP-competitive agents such as imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, and bosutinib, as well as newer agents like ponatinib that effectively target resistance mutations (e.g., the T315I “gatekeeper” mutation). Furthermore, allosteric inhibitors such as GNF-2 and ABL001 (asciminib) bind to the myristoyl pocket, specifically stabilizing the inactive conformation of ABL1 with increased selectivity and reduced off-target effects. Beyond its oncogenic roles, ABL1 is exploited by various microbial pathogens that hijack its signaling to reorganize the host cytoskeleton and facilitate processes such as intracellular movement and cell exit. These diverse biological functions and regulatory mechanisms underscore ABL1’s central role in normal cellular physiology and disease, making it a pivotal target in both hematological and solid malignancies (colicelli2010abltyrosinekinases pages 36-37, walz2008comparisonofmutated pages 1-2, jones2020allostericinhibitionof pages 5-8, zeng2020ponatinibandother pages 1-3).\n\n9.

Coordinates actin remodeling through tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins controlling cytoskeleton dynamics like MYH10 (involved in movement); CTTN (involved in signaling); or TUBA1 and TUBB (microtubule subunits). Binds directly F-actin and regulates actin cytoskeletal structure through its F-actin-bundling activity. Involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and motility through phosphorylation of key regulators of these processes such as CRK, CRKL, DOK1 or ARHGAP35. Adhesion-dependent phosphorylation of ARHGAP35 promotes its association with RASA1, resulting in recruitment of ARHGAP35 to the cell periphery where it inhibits RHO. Phosphorylates multiple receptor tyrosine kinases like PDGFRB and other substrates which are involved in endocytosis regulation such as RIN1. In brain, may regulate neurotransmission by phosphorylating proteins at the synapse. ABL2 also acts as a regulator of multiple pathological signaling cascades during infection. Pathogens can highjack ABL2 kinase signaling to reorganize the host actin cytoskeleton for multiple purposes, like facilitating intracellular movement and host cell exit. Finally, functions as its own regulator through autocatalytic activity as well as through phosphorylation of its inhibitor, ABI1.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase ABL2 – also known as Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2, ABL2, ARG, or ABLL – is a non‐receptor tyrosine kinase that belongs to the Abl family of kinases. Comparative studies reveal that the N‐terminal regulatory segments and the conserved catalytic kinase domain of ABL2 display very high sequence identity with those of its paralog ABL1, whereas the divergent C‐terminal region imparts unique binding properties to cytoskeletal elements and dictates its specific subcellular distribution. In invertebrates such as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, a single ABL gene is observed; however, gene duplication events in vertebrates led to the evolution of two distinct paralogs, ABL1 and ABL2, which fulfill overlapping yet non‐redundant roles in cell signaling and cytoskeletal regulation. Phylogenetic analysis of the human kinome—using studies such as the comprehensive kinase catalogues presented by Manning and colleagues—demonstrates that the Abl family, defined by the presence of conserved Src homology 3 (SH3), Src homology 2 (SH2), and tyrosine kinase domains, forms a distinct branch within the overall tyrosine kinase group (colicelli2010abltyrosinekinases pages 1-2, johnson2023anatlasof pages 1-2, kfoury2014developingandoptimizing pages 37-42, chiu2013kidfammapadatabase pages 6-8).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nABL2 functions as a classical tyrosine kinase, catalyzing the phosphotransfer reaction from ATP to specific tyrosine residues on substrate proteins. The biochemical reaction mediated by ABL2 can be succinctly summarized as follows:  \n  ATP + [protein]‐L‐tyrosine → ADP + [protein]‐L‐tyrosine‐phosphate + H⁺  \nThis reaction constitutes the primary catalytic mechanism of tyrosine kinases and underpins the ability of ABL2 to modulate myriad signaling pathways involved in cellular proliferation, survival, motility, and cytoskeleton remodeling (colicelli2010abltyrosinekinases pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe enzymatic activity of ABL2 relies on the presence of divalent metal ions. In particular, Mg²⁺ serves as an essential cofactor that coordinates the binding of ATP within the active site of the kinase domain. This coordination facilitates the proper alignment of ATP for efficient phosphotransfer and is a hallmark of the catalytic mechanism employed by most protein kinases. The dependence on Mg²⁺ ensures that ABL2 is capable of precise regulation of its phosphorylation reactions under physiologically relevant conditions (jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 12-14).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nThe substrate specificity of ABL2 is defined by its intrinsic capacity to recognize and phosphorylate peptide motifs that contain central tyrosine residues within a defined amino acid context. High‐throughput analyses of the human tyrosine kinome have established that Abl family kinases preferentially target substrates involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal architecture. In this regard, ABL2 has been shown to phosphorylate key proteins such as MYH10—a motor protein involved in intracellular movement—as well as cortactin (CTTN), which plays an essential role in actin filament assembly and signaling cascades, and the tubulin subunits TUBA1 and TUBB that are crucial for microtubule integrity and dynamics. Detailed motif analyses indicate that optimal substrates for ABL2 display a target tyrosine flanked by hydrophobic as well as basic residues, with positions immediately upstream (for example, the −3 to −1 positions) often enriched in basic amino acids that contribute to substrate discrimination relative to closely related kinases such as ABL1 (Yaron-Barir2024 pages 1174-1181, aleem2015constitutiveactivityin pages 11-13, johnson2023anatlasof pages 4-5).\n\n5. Structure  \nThe three‐dimensional structure of ABL2 is highly modular and exhibits a domain organization that integrates its catalytic functions with interactions critical for cytoskeletal rearrangement. The enzyme can be divided into three major regions:\n\n• N‐terminal Region and Regulatory Domains –  \nThe extreme N‐terminus of ABL2 is subject to co‐translational myristoylation, a lipid modification that contributes to autoinhibition by anchoring the N‐terminal region to a hydrophobic pocket within the kinase domain. Adjacent to this modified segment, ABL2 contains a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain that recognizes proline‐rich motifs in interacting proteins, thereby mediating both substrate recruitment and regulatory protein associations. Following the SH3 domain, the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain binds phosphotyrosine‐containing peptides, which not only serves an adaptor function but also participates in intramolecular regulatory masking. These domains together form the regulatory cassette that is common among the Abl family, ensuring that basal kinase activity is kept at low levels until appropriate activating signals are received (jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 22-24, kfoury2014developingandoptimizing pages 26-37).\n\n• Central Catalytic Kinase Domain –  \nThe core of ABL2 is the conserved tyrosine kinase domain, which adopts the classic bilobed structure found in most protein kinases. The smaller N‐terminal lobe is composed primarily of beta‐sheet structures and contains the glycine‐rich loop responsible for ATP binding. The larger C‐terminal lobe consists predominantly of α‐helices and forms the substrate binding site as well as the catalytic machinery. Within this domain, key structural features include the ATP‐binding cleft, the activation loop whose phosphorylation status is critical for activity, a hydrophobic spine that contributes to the stabilization of the active conformation, and the regulatory C‐helix whose proper positioning is essential for catalysis. Crystallographic and computational studies, including AlphaFold predictions, confirm that the overall 3D arrangement of these elements is highly conserved among Abl kinases and is well‐suited for its role in phosphotransfer (jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 22-24, loris2007exploringstructureanda pages 143-146).\n\n• C‐terminal Extension –  \nUnlike ABL1, ABL2 possesses a variable C‐terminal region that is less conserved and imparts unique interactions with the cytoskeleton. This region contains one or more F‐actin binding domains that enable ABL2 to bind directly to filamentous actin (F‐actin) and mediate its bundling. In some isoforms, additional domains are present that facilitate interactions with microtubules, thereby linking kinase activity to the regulation of both actin filaments and microtubule networks. The structural elements in this portion of the protein have been modeled to form irregular secondary structural motifs that provide a flexible interface for multiple protein–protein interactions, which are essential for its role in controlling cell shape, motility, and adhesion (johnson2023anatlasof pages 7-7, kfoury2014developingandoptimizing pages 26-37, loris2007exploringstructureanda pages 143-146).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe activity of ABL2 is subject to complex regulatory controls that include intrinsic autoinhibitory mechanisms and extrinsic post‐translational modifications. Key aspects of its regulation include:\n\n• Autoinhibition and Conformational Control –  \nIn the basal state, ABL2 is maintained in a closed, autoinhibited conformation by intramolecular interactions mediated by its SH3 and SH2 domains. The N‐terminal myristoylation further contributes to this inhibition by inserting into a hydrophobic pocket of the kinase domain. This “latch‐clamp” mechanism restricts access of substrates to the catalytic site. Activation of ABL2 requires disruption of these inhibitory contacts, often triggered by autophosphorylation events within the activation loop. Once phosphorylated at key tyrosine residues in the activation loop, conformational changes occur that shift the equilibrium toward an open, catalytically competent state (daraiseh2017tyrosinephosphorylationof pages 39-44, jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 24-26, kfoury2014developingandoptimizing pages 17-26).\n\n• Phosphorylation and Feedback Regulation –  \nABL2 undergoes autophosphorylation at critical residues; this self‐phosphorylation event is one of the principal mechanisms by which the kinase is switched from an inactive to an active state. In addition, ABL2 phosphorylates its inhibitory partner ABI1, establishing a negative feedback loop that modulates its own catalytic activity. External signals—such as those emanating from receptor tyrosine kinases including PDGFRB—can induce trans‐phosphorylation of ABL2, further integrating it into broader signal transduction networks that govern cell motility and cytoskeletal reorganization (daraiseh2017tyrosinephosphorylationof pages 39-44, taft2017ayeastbasedassay pages 8-13, jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 24-26, kfoury2014developingandoptimizing pages 17-26).\n\n• Allosteric Modulation –  \nThe conformational dynamics of ABL2 allow for allosteric regulation by interacting proteins and small-molecule inhibitors. Binding of external ligands to the SH3 and SH2 domains can displace intramolecular contacts and relieve autoinhibition, thereby promoting activity. In addition, targeted inhibitors have been shown to preferentially bind to either the “DFG‐in” (active) or “DFG‐out” (inactive) conformations of the kinase domain, providing insights into the allosteric flexibility of the enzyme (hari2013conformationselectiveinhibitorsreveal pages 13-17, taft2017ayeastbasedassay pages 62-67).\n\n7. Function  \nABL2 functions as a central mediator of cytoskeletal dynamics and plays multifaceted roles in signal transduction across a variety of cellular contexts. Its biological functions comprise:\n\n• Regulation of Cytoskeletal Dynamics –  \nABL2 phosphorylates an array of substrates that are critical for the regulation of both actin and microtubule networks. For instance, phosphorylation of MYH10 by ABL2 modulates the motor activity required for intracellular transport, while phosphorylation of cortactin (CTTN) influences actin filament assembly and turnover. In addition, ABL2 targets tubulin subunits such as TUBA1 and TUBB, thereby impacting microtubule stability and dynamics. The direct binding of ABL2 to F‐actin through its C-terminal domains further reinforces its capacity to reorganize the actin cytoskeleton, contributing to the formation of cell protrusions and stress fibers that are essential for motility and adhesion (aleem2015constitutiveactivityin pages 11-13, johnson2023anatlasof pages 6-7, taft2017ayeastbasedassay pages 57-62).\n\n• Modulation of Cell Adhesion and Motility –  \nABL2 phosphorylates adaptor proteins such as CRK and CRKL, as well as regulatory molecules like DOK1 and ARHGAP35. In particular, phosphorylation of ARHGAP35 facilitates its interaction with RASA1 at the cell periphery, where it serves to locally inhibit RHO GTPase signaling. This inhibition is critical for regulating focal adhesion dynamics, cell spreading, and directional cell migration. Together, these phosphorylation events coordinate the rearrangement of the cytoskeleton in response to extracellular stimuli, thereby influencing processes such as cell migration, invasion, and receptor endocytosis (johnson2023anatlasof pages 6-7, taft2017ayeastbasedassay pages 57-62).\n\n• Neuronal and Immune Functions –  \nIn neuronal tissues, ABL2 is implicated in the regulation of synaptic activity by phosphorylating proteins that modulate neurotransmission. Its high expression in brain regions such as synapses suggests a specialized role in controlling dendritic architecture and synaptic plasticity. In addition, ABL2 is a key player in immune cell function; it has been demonstrated to positively regulate chemokine-mediated T-cell migration, polarization, and homing to lymph nodes. This function is thought to involve the activation of downstream effectors such as NEDD9/HEF1 and RAP1, which are part of the signaling cascades responsible for immune cell dynamics (yu2023ablsandtmks pages 27-32, taft2017ayeastbasedassay pages 13-22).\n\n• Integration of Extracellular Signals and Pathogen Interaction –  \nABL2 acts downstream of various receptor tyrosine kinases—including PDGFRB and other growth factor receptors—integrating signals that govern actin and microtubule dynamics. In addition, several pathogens have evolved mechanisms to hijack ABL2 signaling to promote reorganization of the host cell actin cytoskeleton, thereby facilitating intracellular movement and subsequent egress. This capacity underscores the importance of ABL2 as a nexus in the cellular response to both physiological and pathological stimuli (aleem2015constitutiveactivityin pages 11-13, johnson2023anatlasof pages 6-7, taft2017ayeastbasedassay pages 57-62).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral small-molecule inhibitors originally developed to target ABL1 have been shown to also inhibit ABL2, due to the high degree of sequence and structural similarity in their catalytic domains. For example, imatinib and dasatinib are known to bind to the ATP-binding site of ABL kinases, although efforts continue to identify compounds with enhanced specificity for ABL2. Conformation-selective inhibitors that discriminate based on the DFG motif orientation (active “DFG-in” versus inactive “DFG-out” states) have been particularly informative in dissecting the allosteric regulation of ABL2 and may offer strategies for overcoming drug resistance.  \nIn the context of disease, aberrant ABL2 activity has been linked to various pathological processes, including oncogenesis—especially in instances where kinase fusion proteins are formed—as well as in certain infectious and neurodegenerative conditions. Mutations and altered post-translational modifications in ABL2, though less frequently reported than in ABL1, may contribute to changes in cell migration and adhesion properties that are relevant in tumor progression and metastasis. Integrative approaches, including deep learning-coupled proximity proteomics, have been applied to further elucidate the substrate specificity and broader signaling networks of ABL2, underscoring its role as a key mediator in cytoskeleton-directed pathways (hari2013conformationselectiveinhibitorsreveal pages 13-17, taft2017ayeastbasedassay pages 62-67, wu2021plateletderivedgrowthfactor pages 10-16).\n\n9.

Phosphorylates tyrosine residues located in the C-terminal tails of Src-family kinases (SFKs) including LCK, SRC, HCK, FYN, LYN, CSK or YES1. Upon tail phosphorylation, Src-family members engage in intramolecular interactions between the phosphotyrosine tail and the SH2 domain that result in an inactive conformation. To inhibit SFKs, CSK is recruited to the plasma membrane via binding to transmembrane proteins or adapter proteins located near the plasma membrane. Suppresses signaling by various surface receptors, including T-cell receptor (TCR) and B-cell receptor (BCR) by phosphorylating and maintaining inactive several positive effectors such as FYN or LCK**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase CSK is a highly conserved non‐receptor protein tyrosine kinase that belongs to the CSK‐family of kinases. Orthologs of CSK are found across all vertebrate species, and related kinases with similar domain architecture exist in invertebrates, underscoring its deep evolutionary roots. CSK is evolutionarily distinct from Src family kinases even though both groups share a tyrosine kinase fold; CSK evolved specifically as an endogenous negative regulator of Src family kinases. Its placement in the kinome is further supported by its conservation of the SH3, SH2, and catalytic domains, and by sequence features that differentiate it from receptor tyrosine kinases and from other cytoplasmic kinases. This conserved configuration and unique evolution as a suppressor of Src activity indicate that CSK emerged early in metazoan evolution and is maintained as part of the core regulatory network controlling tyrosine phosphorylation‐dependent signal transduction (chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 1-2, fortner2022apoptosisregulationby pages 1-2, superti‐furga1995structure‐functionrelationshipsin pages 5-6).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCSK catalyzes a phosphoryl transfer reaction in which the gamma–phosphate group from ATP is transferred to a tyrosine residue on its substrate proteins. In particular, CSK phosphorylates a conserved C-terminal tyrosine residue found in Src family kinases. The overall chemical reaction can be summarized as:  \n  ATP + [protein]-tyrosine → ADP + [protein]-phosphotyrosine + H⁺  \nThis reaction is central to the enzyme’s role as a negative regulator of Src kinases, as phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail induces intramolecular interactions that lock Src family kinases into an inactive conformation (ia2010structuralelementsand pages 52-56, sondhi1998peptideandprotein pages 6-7).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of CSK is dependent on the binding of ATP and the presence of divalent metal ions, most notably Mg²⁺. Mg²⁺ serves as a critical cofactor by coordinating with ATP in the active site and facilitating the transfer of the phosphoryl group to the tyrosine residue of the substrate. Although in vitro studies have demonstrated that other divalent metal ions may support catalysis under certain conditions, Mg²⁺ is considered the physiologically relevant ion required for optimal kinase activity (sun2023dissectionofthe pages 1-2, sondhi1998peptideandprotein pages 6-7).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCSK exhibits remarkable substrate specificity, targeting primarily the conserved C-terminal tail tyrosine residues of Src family kinases such as Lck, Src, Hck, Fyn, Lyn, and Yes. Phosphorylation of this specific tyrosine residue is essential for inducing the conformational change that renders these kinases inactive. The enzyme’s specificity is not solely determined by the local amino acid sequence around the phosphorylation site but is also a result of extended docking interactions that occur between CSK and its substrates. Such protein–protein interactions ensure that CSK effectively distinguishes its physiological targets from other potential tyrosine‐containing motifs. In vitro studies using peptide substrates have demonstrated that short peptide sequences derived from Src tails are phosphorylated with much lower efficiency compared to the full protein, which points to the importance of tertiary interactions in substrate recognition. The intrinsically narrow substrate specificity of CSK has been further characterized in studies of the human tyrosine kinome, which indicate that CSK predominantly phosphorylates a set of substrates defined by their conformational presentation of the C-terminal tail (chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 5-6, fortner2022apoptosisregulationby pages 1-2, cole2003proteintyrosinekinases pages 1-2).\n\n5. Structure  \nCSK displays a modular architecture that comprises three main domains arranged sequentially from the N- to C-terminus. The N-terminal region includes the SH3 domain, which contributes to protein–protein interactions and has been implicated in mediating dimerization of CSK in vitro. Adjacent to the SH3 domain is the SH2 domain, responsible for binding short phosphotyrosine-containing motifs on transmembrane or adaptor proteins, thereby aiding in the recruitment of CSK to the plasma membrane where its substrates reside. The central portion of the protein contains the kinase catalytic domain, which is responsible for the phosphoryl transfer reaction. Detailed structural studies, including crystallographic analyses and solution-based models, have revealed key catalytic features within the kinase domain, such as the glycine-rich loop (P-loop), the β3 strand lysine that interacts with the phosphate groups of ATP, the activation (or T-) loop, and the conserved DFG motif involved in magnesium ion coordination. Additionally, regions such as the hydrophobic spine and the αC-helix are critical in establishing the active conformation of the kinase. Unique structural aspects of CSK include the absence of an autophosphorylatable activation loop tyrosine and distinctive interdomain contacts that modulate its activity. Recent mutagenesis and domain-swapping experiments further emphasize the importance of the N-terminal lobe motifs; mutations in specific residues in this region lead to dramatic changes in catalytic efficiency (ia2010structuralelementsand pages 6-10, ia2010structuralelementsand pages 21-25, huang2009identificationofnterminal pages 20-21, chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 2-3).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulatory mechanisms controlling CSK activity are multifactorial. Post-translational modifications play a significant role; notably, CSK is phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase at Ser364, an event that enhances its kinase activity. Redox regulation also influences CSK function through the formation and breakage of a disulfide bond between conserved cysteine residues (e.g., Cys122 and Cys164), modulating the active conformation of the enzyme. In addition to these modifications, CSK is subject to allosteric regulation via its regulatory domains. The SH2 and SH3 domains not only facilitate membrane targeting by binding to phosphotyrosine motifs and proline-rich sequences, respectively, but also participate in intramolecular interactions that can either suppress or activate the catalytic domain. Binding of adaptor proteins, such as Cbp/PAG, recruits CSK to lipid raft microdomains in the plasma membrane, thus enhancing its access to Src family kinases. Moreover, conformational changes induced by ligand binding to the SH2 domain can trigger rearrangements in the kinase domain, thereby modulating catalytic efficiency. Structural investigations have delineated how specific contact points between the regulatory and catalytic regions are critical for maintaining CSK in either an active or inactive state (ia2010structuralelementsand pages 17-21, okada2012regulationofthe pages 6-9, sun2023dissectionofthe pages 6-8, chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 11-12).\n\n7. Function  \nCSK serves as a master negative regulator of Src family kinases within cellular signaling networks. By phosphorylating a conserved C-terminal tyrosine residue on SFKs, CSK induces an intramolecular binding of the phosphotyrosine to the SH2 domain of the same SFK, thereby stabilizing an inactive conformation. This mechanism is critical for maintaining proper control of cell growth, differentiation, migration, and immune responses. CSK is expressed ubiquitously, and its localization to the plasma membrane is facilitated by interactions with transmembrane or adaptor proteins such as Cbp/PAG. In immune cells, CSK plays a pivotal role in modulating signal transduction through the T-cell receptor (TCR) and B-cell receptor (BCR), as it suppresses downstream signaling events by keeping positive effectors such as Lck and Fyn in an inactive state. In addition to its well-established function in Src inhibition, CSK has been implicated in the regulation of cytoskeletal organization via non-catalytic mechanisms, such as interacting with focal adhesion molecules. The critical balance maintained by CSK in controlling SFK activity also underpins its tumor suppressor properties; loss or misregulation of CSK function has been associated with aberrant Src signaling, which can contribute to oncogenic transformation and the progression of various cancers (chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 1-2, fortner2022apoptosisregulationby pages 1-2, okada2012regulationofthe pages 9-11, sun2023dissectionofthe pages 1-2).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nAmong the notable features of CSK is its potential as a therapeutic target, given its central role in downregulating oncogenic Src family kinases. Although specific inhibitors targeting CSK directly are less well characterized compared with inhibitors of Src kinases, research in this area continues. In addition, genetic studies have revealed that complete loss of CSK function is embryonically lethal in murine models, underscoring its essential role in normal development and signaling homeostasis. Furthermore, epigenetic alterations or mislocalization of CSK, as may occur via disruption of its interactions with key adaptor proteins, are linked to cancer progression and immune dysregulation. CSK’s regulatory network also involves interactions with phosphatases, such as members of the PEP family, which further fine-tune the balance of tyrosine phosphorylation in cells. The comprehensive understanding of CSK’s substrate specificity, regulation by post-translational modifications, and intricate domain–domain interactions supports ongoing efforts to design strategies that could modulate its activity in disease contexts (cole2003proteintyrosinekinases pages 5-6, wang2001sh2domainmediatedinteraction pages 1-1, fortner2022apoptosisregulationby pages 13-14).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nMATK (megakaryocyte‐associated tyrosine‐protein kinase), also known as CSK homologous kinase, belongs to the non‐receptor tyrosine kinase group and is classified within the Csk family. It shares approximately 50% sequence homology with C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) and clusters within an evolutionarily conserved subfamily that is present across mammalian species. Studies using genome‐wide kinase analysis have established that the Csk family, which comprises kinases with similar regulatory and catalytic features, can be traced back to the common ancestors of eukaryotes (Manning2002TheProteinKinaseComplement pages 1912-1934, Manning2002EvolutionOfProteinKinaseSignaling pages 514-520). In addition, data indicate that the MATK gene is located on human chromosome 19 at the q13.3 locus and its orthologs are found in other vertebrates, underscoring its conserved function in hematopoietic as well as neuronal tissues (grgurevich1997thecsklikeproteins pages 1-3, advani2015cskhomologouskinase(chkmatk) pages 1-5).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nMATK catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to a tyrosine residue on substrate proteins. Specifically, MATK phosphorylates the conserved C-terminal inhibitory tyrosine residue on Src family kinases, leading to their inactivation. The general chemical reaction can be represented as:  \n  ATP + [protein]-L-tyrosine → ADP + [protein]-L-tyrosine-phosphate + H⁺ (advani2015cskhomologouskinase(chkmatk) pages 1-5, advani2015cskhomologouskinase(chkmatk) pages 7-9).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of MATK is dependent on ATP as the phosphate donor and requires divalent metal ions, with Mg²⁺ being the principal cofactor necessary for stabilizing the ATP and facilitating phosphoryl transfer. This cofactor requirement is typical for protein kinases and is in line with the conserved structural and biochemical mechanisms observed in tyrosine kinases (loris2007exploringstructureand pages 43-46, advani2015cskhomologouskinase(chkmatk) pages 22-24).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nMATK exhibits a substrate specificity consistent with that of tyrosine kinases, with a particular preference for phosphorylating the conserved C-terminal tyrosine residues on members of the Src family. This specificity is achieved through the recognition of a particular set of amino acid residues surrounding the phosphorylation site; MATK targets the unphosphorylated and ligand-free forms of Src-family kinases. Moreover, MATK is noted to employ both a catalytic phosphorylation mechanism and an additional non-catalytic inhibitory mechanism that involves direct binding to the kinase domains of active Src family kinases, thereby expanding its substrate inhibitory repertoire (advani2015cskhomologouskinase(chkmatk) pages 7-9, advani2015cskhomologouskinase(chkmatk) pages 18-22, yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 1-2).\n\n5. Structure  \nMATK is organized into distinct functional domains that confer its regulatory and catalytic functions. The structure of MATK includes:\n • An N-terminal region that exists in isoform-specific variations. In particular, two main isoforms have been characterized: p56Chk/Matk and p52Chk/Matk; the p56 isoform contains an extra 41 amino acid segment that is involved in nuclear localization and has specific regulatory roles, while the p52 isoform, predominantly expressed in neurons, lacks this segment (advani2015cskhomologouskinase(chkmatk) pages 5-7, advani2015cskhomologouskinase(chkmatk) pages 12-18).  \n • An SH3 domain encoded by exons 2–6 and an overlapping SH2 domain encoded by exons 4–6, both of which mediate protein–protein interactions essential for targeting and proper subcellular localization. These domains are critical for binding proline-rich motifs and phosphotyrosine-containing peptides, respectively (advani2015cskhomologouskinase(chkmatk) pages 5-7, grgurevich1997thecsklikeproteins pages 11-13).  \n • A catalytic tyrosine kinase domain encoded by exons 7–13, which includes the ATP-binding site (located within exon 7) and the conserved catalytic motifs typical of tyrosine kinases, such as the glycine-rich loop, the catalytic loop (containing HRD or HRDLAARN-like sequence elements), and elements that form the hydrophobic spines and the C-helix. These features are integral to substrate binding and the transfer of the phosphate group (advani2015cskhomologouskinase(chkmatk) pages 1-5, advani2015cskhomologouskinase(chkmatk) pages 22-24).  \nAdditionally, MATK lacks an N-terminal fatty acid acylation motif, indicating that its subcellular targeting is primarily mediated by the SH2 and SH3 domains rather than membrane localization signals (advani2015cskhomologouskinase(chkmatk) pages 5-7). Structural models and sequence alignments corroborate the similarity between MATK and Csk, while also highlighting unique regulatory sequences that underlie its dual inhibitory mechanisms (advani2015cskhomologouskinase(chkmatk) pages 7-9, grgurevich1997thecsklikeproteins pages 1-3).\n\n6. Regulation  \nMATK is regulated by both transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms. At the transcriptional level, its promoter region, which is GC-rich and contains multiple transcription factor binding motifs (e.g., GATA-1, Sp1, APRE), lacks a TATA box but includes bona fide CpG islands. These features render MATK susceptible to epigenetic control through hypermethylation, which has been documented in various cancers such as colorectal cancer, acute lymphocytic leukemia, and gliomas, resulting in downregulation of MATK expression (advani2015cskhomologouskinase(chkmatk) pages 1-5, advani2015cskhomologouskinase(chkmatk) pages 5-7).  \nPost-translationally, MATK’s regulation is mediated by its domain interactions. The SH2 and SH3 domains facilitate binding to phosphorylated motifs on target proteins, ensuring proper subcellular localization and regulatory control of Src family kinases. Moreover, while MATK lacks a canonical autophosphorylation site commonly found in many kinases, its activity is modulated through conformational changes that are induced by binding interactions with substrates and associated proteins. In addition to phosphorylating its targets, MATK also exerts a non-catalytic inhibitory effect by directly interacting with and suppressing active forms of Src family kinases, further contributing to its role as a negative regulator within tyrosine kinase signaling networks (advani2015cskhomologouskinase(chkmatk) pages 7-9, advani2015cskhomologouskinase(chkmatk) pages 18-22, grgurevich1997thecsklikeproteins pages 11-13).\n\n7. Function  \nMATK plays an important role in the signal transduction of hematopoietic cells and neuronal tissues. Its primary function is to negatively regulate Src family kinases (SFKs) by phosphorylating a conserved inhibitory tyrosine residue in their C-terminal regions, which induces conformational changes that stabilize an inactive state. Through this mechanism, MATK serves as a “molecular policeman” that helps maintain cellular homeostasis and prevents aberrant kinase activation that may contribute to oncogenesis (advani2015cskhomologouskinase(chkmatk) pages 1-5, advani2015cskhomologouskinase(chkmatk) pages 7-9).  \nIn hematopoietic cells, MATK is highly expressed and is implicated in the regulation of T-cell proliferation and differentiation. Its ability to modulate SFK activity influences a range of cellular processes including cell growth, migration, and immune response. In brain cells, MATK’s phosphorylation of SFKs contributes to the control of neuronal signaling pathways. Furthermore, mutations and epigenetic silencing of MATK have been observed in cancers—including colorectal, lung, and breast carcinomas as well as hematological malignancies—underscoring its tumor suppressor properties (advani2015cskhomologouskinase(chkmatk) pages 1-5, advani2015cskhomologouskinase(chkmatk) pages 22-24, grgurevich1997thecsklikeproteins pages 13-14).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nNumerous cancer-associated missense mutations have been identified in MATK, with over 50 documented mutations affecting residues within its SH2, SH3, and catalytic domains. Some of these mutations likely impair its ability to inhibit Src family kinases effectively. Epigenetic mechanisms such as promoter hypermethylation have been documented as a means of MATK downregulation in several tumor types, correlating with increased SFK activity and oncogenic signaling. Although direct inhibitors targeting MATK specifically have not been extensively reported, the unique dual inhibitory mechanism of MATK has spurred interest in developing biomimetic compounds that could modulate SFK activity by recapitulating MATK’s regulatory effects (advani2015cskhomologouskinase(chkmatk) pages 1-5, advani2015cskhomologouskinase(chkmatk) pages 7-9, banerjee2013phosphorylationubiquitylationandb pages 26-29).\n\n9.

MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1 are the 2 MAPKs which play an important role in the MAPK/ERK cascade. They participate also in a signaling cascade initiated by activated KIT and KITLG/SCF. Depending on the cellular context, the MAPK/ERK cascade mediates diverse biological functions such as cell growth, adhesion, survival and differentiation through the regulation of transcription, translation, cytoskeletal rearrangements. The MAPK/ERK cascade also plays a role in initiation and regulation of meiosis, mitosis, and postmitotic functions in differentiated cells by phosphorylating a number of transcription factors. About 160 substrates have already been discovered for ERKs. Many of these substrates are localized in the nucleus, and seem to participate in the regulation of transcription upon stimulation. However, other substrates are found in the cytosol as well as in other cellular organelles, and those are responsible for processes such as translation, mitosis and apoptosis. Moreover, the MAPK/ERK cascade is also involved in the regulation of the endosomal dynamics, including lysosome processing and endosome cycling through the perinuclear recycling compartment (PNRC); as well as in the fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus during mitosis. The substrates include transcription factors (such as ATF2, BCL6, ELK1, ERF, FOS, HSF4 or SPZ1), cytoskeletal elements (such as CANX, CTTN, GJA1, MAP2, MAPT, PXN, SORBS3 or STMN1), regulators of apoptosis (such as BAD, BTG2, CASP9, DAPK1, IER3, MCL1 or PPARG), regulators of translation (such as EIF4EBP1 and FXR1) and a variety of other signaling-related molecules (like ARHGEF2, DCC, FRS2 or GRB10). Protein kinases (such as RAF1, RPS6KA1/RSK1, RPS6KA3/RSK2, RPS6KA2/RSK3, RPS6KA6/RSK4, SYK, MKNK1/MNK1, MKNK2/MNK2, RPS6KA5/MSK1, RPS6KA4/MSK2, MAPKAPK3 or MAPKAPK5) and phosphatases (such as DUSP1, DUSP4, DUSP6 or DUSP16) are other substrates which enable the propagation the MAPK/ERK signal to additional cytosolic and nuclear targets, thereby extending the specificity of the cascade. Mediates phosphorylation of TPR in response to EGF stimulation. May play a role in the spindle assembly checkpoint. Phosphorylates PML and promotes its interaction with PIN1, leading to PML degradation. Phosphorylates CDK2AP2 (By similarity). Phosphorylates phosphoglycerate kinase PGK1 under hypoxic conditions to promote its targeting to the mitochondrion and suppress the formation of acetyl-coenzyme A from pyruvate (PubMed:26942675)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny:  \nMAPK1, commonly known as ERK2, is a member of the conventional mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, which is highly conserved across eukaryotic species and plays a central role in the MAPK/ERK cascade (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 1-1). ERK2 is part of the ERK1/2 subgroup that is ubiquitously expressed in mammals and has clear orthologs in simpler eukaryotes such as yeast, reflecting its early emergence in the evolution of kinase signaling pathways (keshet2010themapkinase pages 1-4). Its evolutionary conservation is underscored by its retention in species ranging from invertebrates to humans, and it clusters with other conventional MAPKs that evolved from common ancestral kinases present in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 2-4, keshet2010themapkinase pages 11-12). Furthermore, evolutionary studies reveal that the ERK1/2 isoforms have undergone gene duplication events with subtle divergence in function, where ERK2, in particular, exhibits non-redundant roles—for example, gene ablation of ERK2 in mice results in embryonic lethality whereas ERK1 knockout animals are viable (roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 1-2, keshet2010themapkinase pages 7-9). In addition, investigations into the broader kinome (as detailed in the classical studies by Manning and co-workers) position ERK2 within the protein kinase superfamily, specifically the CMGC group, which includes cyclin‐dependent kinases (CDKs), glycogen synthase kinases (GSKs), and other MAP kinases (roux2004erkandp38 pages 1-1). Together, available data support that MAPK1/ERK2 is an integral component of the evolutionarily conserved MAPK core signaling system that is essential from yeast to man (keshet2010themapkinase pages 1-4, roux2004erkandp38 pages 2-3).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed:  \nMAPK1/ERK2 is a serine/threonine kinase that catalyzes the transfer of a γ-phosphoryl group from ATP to hydroxyl groups on specific serine or threonine residues in substrate proteins, generating ADP and a phosphorylated protein product along with a proton (roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 1-2, roux2004erkandp38 pages 1-2). This catalytic reaction can be represented as: ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺, which lies at the core of its function in signal transduction (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 1-1).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements:  \nThe enzymatic activity of MAPK1/ERK2 requires divalent metal ions as essential cofactors, with Mg²⁺ being the most critical for coordinating ATP within the active site and facilitating phosphotransfer (roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 1-2, roux2004erkandp38 pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity:  \nMAPK1/ERK2 exhibits a substrate preference that is characteristic of proline‐directed serine/threonine kinases, favoring phosphorylation of serine or threonine residues followed by a proline residue (keshet2010themapkinase pages 11-12, roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 11-12). Detailed recent studies of the human serine/threonine kinome have provided an atlas of substrate specificities, wherein ERK2 has been shown to preferentially target consensus motifs with a central Ser/Thr-Pro sequence, and its substrate specificity is further refined by docking interactions mediated by D and F (DEF) domain docking sites (Johnson2023, Yaron-Barir2024). In this regard, substrates that are phosphorylated by ERK2 include transcription factors and other signaling proteins that possess well-defined MAPK-docking motifs, ensuring high‐affinity, specific interactions during signal propagation (roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 11-12).\n\n5. Structure:  \nMAPK1/ERK2 is composed of a conserved kinase domain that is flanked by relatively unconserved N- and C-terminal regions; the central kinase core comprises two lobes—a smaller N-terminal lobe largely responsible for ATP binding and a larger C-terminal lobe that mediates substrate binding and catalysis (roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 34-35, cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 2-4). The 3D organization features an activation loop which undergoes a conformational change upon dual phosphorylation at a threonine and tyrosine residue within the conserved Thr-Glu-Tyr (TEY) motif; this phosphorylation induces a rotation of the C-helix (“αC-in” conformation) and contributes to assembly of the hydrophobic spine essential for full catalytic activity (roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 35-36, keshet2010themapkinase pages 11-12). Moreover, ERK2 possesses specific substrate docking sites, including a D-site recruitment site (DRS or CD domain) and an F-site recruitment site (FRS), which together enable interaction with a wide variety of cytosolic and nuclear substrates (meister2013mitogenactivatedprotein(map) pages 1-4, roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 11-12). Structural studies have provided high-resolution details of these domains, and the overall fold of ERK2 is typical of the kinase family, sharing significant structural similarity with other members of the CMGC group (keshet2010themapkinase pages 1-4, roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 2-2).\n\n6. Regulation:  \nActivation of MAPK1/ERK2 is regulated primarily through dual phosphorylation on specific threonine and tyrosine residues located within its activation loop by upstream dual-specificity kinases, specifically MEK1 and MEK2 (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 2-4, turjanski2007mapkinasesand pages 5-6). This phosphorylation event results in a dramatic increase in kinase activity—by several orders of magnitude—and is associated with conformational rearrangements that expose substrate docking sites (roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 36-36, kyriakis2001mammalianmitogenactivatedmapkinases pages 13-15). In addition to phosphorylation-dependent activation, ERK2 is subject to deactivation by a variety of dual-specificity phosphatases (MKPs), such as DUSP6, which remove the activating phosphates thereby switching off kinase activity (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 1-1, roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 36-36). Regulatory complexes and scaffold proteins, including KSR and MP1, facilitate the efficiency and spatial specificity of ERK2 signaling by assembling upstream kinases with ERK2 and protecting activated ERK2 from premature dephosphorylation (meister2013mitogenactivatedprotein(map) pages 6-8, keshet2010themapkinase pages 23-25). Furthermore, additional post-translational modifications and interactions with other proteins, such as the association with nuclear import factors, contribute to the regulation of ERK2’s subcellular localization, enabling it to translocate into the nucleus where it phosphorylates transcription factors (turjanski2007mapkinasesand pages 5-6).\n\n7. Function:  \nMAPK1/ERK2 operates as a pivotal serine/threonine kinase within the MAPK/ERK cascade, and its activity is essential for transducing extracellular signals such as growth factors, cytokines, and mitogens into a diverse array of cellular responses (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 1-1, keshet2010themapkinase pages 7-9). It phosphorylates approximately 160 known substrates that include transcription factors (e.g., ATF2, ELK1, FOS), regulators of translation (e.g., EIF4EBP1), cytoskeletal proteins, and regulatory molecules implicated in apoptosis and cell cycle control, thereby directing processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and adhesion (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 2-4, roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 5-6). ERK2 also contributes to the regulation of endosomal dynamics, including lysosomal processing and endosome recycling, as well as the fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus during mitosis (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 1-1, keshet2010themapkinase pages 7-9). In the context of cell cycle regulation, ERK2 mediates the initiation and proper progression of meiosis and mitosis by phosphorylating a variety of proteins including those involved in spindle assembly checkpoint control (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 1-2, turjanski2007mapkinasesand pages 5-6). Upstream activation of ERK2 is achieved through a signaling cascade initiated by receptor tyrosine kinases such as KIT and EGFR, which, via adaptor proteins and the small GTPase Ras, engage Raf and MEK to ultimately phosphorylate and activate ERK2 (keshet2010themapkinase pages 4-5, turjanski2007mapkinasesand pages 5-6). Downstream, ERK2 phosphorylates substrates in both the cytoplasm and nucleus to regulate transcriptional programs and promote translational events that collectively sustain cell growth and survival (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 2-4, zlobin2018mitogenactivatedproteinkinase pages 3-5).\n\n8. Other Comments:  \nNumerous inhibitors targeting components of the MAPK/ERK pathway have been developed due to the pathway’s implication in various disease states, particularly cancer, where constitutive activation of ERK2 is often observed as a consequence of mutations in upstream regulators such as Ras and B-Raf (roux2004erkandp38 pages 2-3, roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 35-36). Although direct inhibitors against ERK2 itself are under active investigation, compounds that indirectly modulate ERK2 activity by inhibiting MEK1/2 have advanced into clinical trials and represent an important avenue for therapeutic intervention (roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 5-6, zlobin2018mitogenactivatedproteinkinase pages 5-6). Disease associations of aberrant ERK2 signaling include a broad range of proliferative disorders and malignancies, as dysregulated ERK2 activity can lead to enhanced cell proliferation, survival signaling, and resistance to apoptosis (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 1-1, turjanski2007mapkinasesand pages 5-6). Notable among these are cancers driven by oncogenic mutations in Ras and B-Raf, where elevated ERK2 activity constitutes a central driver of tumorigenesis (roux2004erkandp38 pages 1-2, turjanski2007mapkinasesand pages 5-6). In addition, the kinase’s involvement in regulating transcription factor phosphorylation, cytoskeletal rearrangements, and endosomal dynamics underscores its diverse role in cellular homeostasis. The intrinsic substrate specificity of ERK2 has been elucidated further by recent high-throughput studies of the human serine/threonine kinome, which detail consensus motifs and phosphorylation preferences that inform potential therapeutic targeting strategies (Johnson2023, Yaron-Barir2024).\n\n9.

MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1 are the 2 MAPKs which play an important role in the MAPK/ERK cascade. They participate also in a signaling cascade initiated by activated KIT and KITLG/SCF. Depending on the cellular context, the MAPK/ERK cascade mediates diverse biological functions such as cell growth, adhesion, survival and differentiation through the regulation of transcription, translation, cytoskeletal rearrangements. The MAPK/ERK cascade also plays a role in initiation and regulation of meiosis, mitosis, and postmitotic functions in differentiated cells by phosphorylating a number of transcription factors. About 160 substrates have already been discovered for ERKs. Many of these substrates are localized in the nucleus, and seem to participate in the regulation of transcription upon stimulation. However, other substrates are found in the cytosol as well as in other cellular organelles, and those are responsible for processes such as translation, mitosis and apoptosis. Moreover, the MAPK/ERK cascade is also involved in the regulation of the endosomal dynamics, including lysosome processing and endosome cycling through the perinuclear recycling compartment (PNRC); as well as in the fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus during mitosis. The substrates include transcription factors (such as ATF2, BCL6, ELK1, ERF, FOS, HSF4 or SPZ1), cytoskeletal elements (such as CANX, CTTN, GJA1, MAP2, MAPT, PXN, SORBS3 or STMN1), regulators of apoptosis (such as BAD, BTG2, CASP9, DAPK1, IER3, MCL1 or PPARG), regulators of translation (such as EIF4EBP1) and a variety of other signaling-related molecules (like ARHGEF2, DEPTOR, FRS2 or GRB10) (PubMed:35216969). Protein kinases (such as RAF1, RPS6KA1/RSK1, RPS6KA3/RSK2, RPS6KA2/RSK3, RPS6KA6/RSK4, SYK, MKNK1/MNK1, MKNK2/MNK2, RPS6KA5/MSK1, RPS6KA4/MSK2, MAPKAPK3 or MAPKAPK5) and phosphatases (such as DUSP1, DUSP4, DUSP6 or DUSP16) are other substrates which enable the propagation the MAPK/ERK signal to additional cytosolic and nuclear targets, thereby extending the specificity of the cascade**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nMitogen‐activated protein kinase 3 (MAPK3), commonly known as ERK1, is a conventional member of the MAP kinase family belonging to the CMGC group of serine/threonine kinases. ERK1 is evolutionarily conserved across metazoans and is found in all vertebrates, where it typically exists alongside its closely related isoform ERK2 (MAPK1) that arose from a gene duplication event in the common ancestor of bony vertebrates. Comparative analyses have shown that ERK1 and ERK2 retain high sequence similarity in their catalytic domains, yet differential evolutionary forces are evident; ERK1 has evolved at a slightly faster rate than ERK2, potentially due to its smaller gene size and differences in regulatory complexity. Phylogenetic studies place ERK1 within the well‐characterized conventional MAP kinases which include subsets activated by the canonical Ras–Raf–MEK–ERK cascade, underscoring its integral role in the propagation of mitogenic and stress signals. Foundational studies on protein kinase evolution, as detailed by Manning et al. (2002) and subsequent reviews, support the assignment of ERK1 to an evolutionary core set of kinases that emerged in early eukaryotes and have maintained critical roles through complex multicellular evolution (martinvega2023navigatingtheerk12 pages 1-2, krishna2008thecomplexityof pages 1-2, pearson2001mitogenactivatedprotein(map) pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nMAPK3/ERK1 is an ATP-dependent serine/threonine kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of specific protein substrates. The chemical reaction that ERK1 mediates is:  \n  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺  \nThis reaction involves the transfer of the γ-phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of a serine or threonine residue in the substrate protein, a process that is fundamental to the regulation of numerous cellular processes (pearson2001mitogenactivatedprotein(map) pages 2-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of MAPK3/ERK1 is dependent upon the presence of divalent metal ions that serve as essential cofactors. In particular, Mg²⁺ is required to coordinate ATP binding and facilitate the transfer of the phosphate group during the catalytic reaction. This cofactor dependency is characteristic of most protein kinases and is critical for stabilizing the transition state of the phosphoryl transfer reaction (pearson2001mitogenactivatedprotein(map) pages 2-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nMAPK3/ERK1 is classified as a proline‐directed kinase, displaying a marked specificity for phosphorylating serine/threonine residues when immediately followed by a proline residue. The minimal consensus motif recognized by ERK1 is [S/T]-P, and additional substrate recognition is facilitated by docking interactions mediated through short linear motifs present in target proteins. These docking motifs, typically referred to as D domains (or CD motifs) and F-recruitment sites (FRS), enhance the affinity and selectivity of ERK1 towards its substrates. Although thousands of phosphorylation sites have been mapped in cellular systems, about 160 bona fide substrates have been experimentally validated for ERK1, encompassing transcription factors, cytoskeletal regulators, and other kinases that further propagate downstream signaling. Recent studies using high-resolution phosphoproteomic analyses have underscored that substrate specificity is a function not only of the minimal phosphorylation motif but also of additional flanking residues—for instance, preferential amino acid sequences may include elements such as [P/L/V/I]-X-[S/T]-P-X-[K/R] in some substrates. Such specificity profiles have been comprehensively mapped for the human serine/threonine kinome in recent atlases that provide detailed substrate motif information. (Johnson2023Atlas, Yaron-Barir2024Atlas)\n\n5. Structure  \nThe three-dimensional organization of MAPK3/ERK1 is highly conserved within the MAP kinase family and features a typical two-lobe kinase structure. The N-terminal lobe of ERK1 contains a predominantly β-sheet architecture with an ATP-binding pocket, whereas the larger C-terminal lobe is mainly α-helical and houses the substrate recognition site. A defining feature of ERK1 is the activation loop, which includes the conserved Thr-Glu-Tyr (TEY) motif; dual phosphorylation of the threonine and tyrosine residues within this loop triggers a conformational rearrangement necessary for full catalytic activation. Structural studies have revealed that phosphorylation induces domain closure and repositions key secondary structural elements, such as the C-helix, thereby assembling a hydrophobic spine essential for substrate binding and catalysis (martinvega2023navigatingtheerk12 pages 4-5, pearson2001mitogenactivatedprotein(map) pages 4-4).\n\nIn addition to the catalytic core, ERK1 contains a conserved acidic common docking (CD) domain that is critical for interactions with upstream kinase activators (such as MEK1/2) and regulatory phosphatases (such as DUSP6), as well as for binding substrates that harbor complementary docking motifs. A feature unique to ERK isoforms is the presence of an N-terminal alanine-rich (NTAR) sequence that enhances translation fidelity and is thought to contribute to the fine-tuning of ERK1 expression levels. Other structural elements, such as the MAP kinase insert, further contribute to its regulation by mediating complex formation with scaffold proteins and influencing subcellular localization (martinvega2023navigatingtheerk12 pages 5-7, meloche2007theerk12mitogenactivated pages 13-13).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe activity of MAPK3/ERK1 is controlled by multiple regulatory mechanisms that ensure precise control of signal transduction downstream of mitogenic stimuli. ERK1 is activated by dual phosphorylation on its TEY motif within the activation loop by upstream dual-specificity kinases MEK1 and MEK2. This phosphorylation event increases its catalytic activity dramatically, often by several orders of magnitude, and serves as the principal switch for turning on downstream signaling events (roberts2007targetingtherafmekerk pages 1-2, martinvega2023navigatingtheerk12 pages 4-5).\n\nInactivation of ERK1 is mediated by a set of dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) including DUSP1, DUSP4, and DUSP6, which dephosphorylate the activation loop, thus attenuating its kinase activity. Regulatory feedback loops are also prominent: ERK1 can phosphorylate upstream components of its own cascade, such as MEK and RAF, thereby creating a negative feedback that modulates the intensity and duration of the signal (krishna2008thecomplexityof pages 10-12, roberts2007targetingtherafmekerk pages 2-3).\n\nFurthermore, ERK1 function is modulated by its interactions with scaffold proteins, such as KSR and IQGAP, which localize kinase modules to specific subcellular compartments and facilitate efficient signal transduction. These scaffold proteins are critical for determining substrate accessibility and can also protect ERK1 from premature dephosphorylation. In addition to classical phosphorylation-dependent activation, non-catalytic functions have emerged whereby ERK1 participates in allosteric regulation of target proteins and modulates transcription by directly interacting with DNA-associated factors in the nucleus (martinvega2023navigatingtheerk12 pages 45-46, krishna2008thecomplexityof pages 10-12).\n\n7. Function  \nMAPK3/ERK1 is an essential serine/threonine kinase involved in the propagation of signals from cell surface receptors through the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK cascade. It plays a pivotal role in regulating a broad range of biological processes that include cell growth, adhesion, survival, differentiation, and the regulation of the cell cycle. In response to growth factors, cytokines, and other extracellular stimuli, ERK1 phosphorylates a variety of substrates that are distributed among the cytoplasm, nucleus, and other subcellular organelles. Many of these substrates are transcription factors—such as ATF2, ELK1, FOS, and SPZ1—whose phosphorylation by ERK1 modulates gene expression required for cell proliferation and differentiation (coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2, martinvega2023navigatingtheerk12 pages 1-2).\n\nAdditionally, ERK1 influences regulatory pathways in the cytosol by phosphorylating components involved in translation (e.g., EIF4EBP1), cytoskeletal dynamics (e.g., CTTN, PXN), apoptosis (e.g., BAD, CASP9), and endosomal trafficking. Its role in coordinating the timing of cell cycle transitions, especially the G1-to-S phase progression, underscores its importance in cell cycle regulation as well as its misregulation in various cancers. ERK1 is also implicated in the modulation of other protein kinases—such as members of the RSK and MSK families—thereby extending its impact on cellular signal amplification and integration of metabolic, apoptotic, and stress responses (roberts2007targetingtherafmekerk pages 3-5, martinvega2023navigatingtheerk12 pages 7-8).\n\nDue to its ubiquitous expression and central role in mitogenic signaling, ERK1 is expressed in a wide variety of tissues ranging from proliferative cells in the developing embryo to differentiated cells in adult tissues. Its activity is required not only for normal cellular physiology but also for pathological conditions such as oncogenesis, where hyperactivation of the MAPK/ERK cascade can lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation and survival (coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2, roberts2007targetingtherafmekerk pages 1-2).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral inhibitors have been developed to target the MAPK/ERK cascade at various points, including MEK inhibitors and direct ERK inhibitors, which have found application in the treatment of cancers characterized by aberrant upstream activation—for example, mutations in receptor tyrosine kinases, RAS, or RAF that lead to constitutive ERK activation. Although direct mutations in MAPK3/ERK1 are less commonly reported in patient samples compared to upstream alterations, the pathway as a whole is a prominent target for anticancer drug development. Inhibitors under clinical investigation include agents that either block the ATP-binding site of ERK or disrupt its interaction with substrates and scaffold proteins, thereby attenuating downstream oncogenic signaling (martinvega2023navigatingtheerk12 pages 45-46, roberts2007targetingtherafmekerk pages 2-3).\n\nIn terms of disease associations, dysregulation of ERK1 plays a major role in several cancers, as well as in developmental disorders that arise from abnormal MAPK/ERK signaling. Alterations in the activity of ERK1 can lead to imbalances in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation, contributing to the oncogenic process. The extensive substrate repertoire and multiple regulatory mechanisms of ERK1 underscore its significance in both normal cellular physiology and pathological states (wang2007mitogenactivatedproteinkinases pages 1-2, coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nMAPK4, also referred to as ERK4 or PRKM4, is an atypical member of the mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) family that belongs to the ERK3/ERK4 subgroup, a lineage restricted to vertebrates and distinct from conventional MAPKs such as ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 (aberg2006regulationofmapkactivated pages 1-2). Sequence comparisons indicate that ERK4 displays approximately 73% amino acid identity within its kinase domain with ERK3, reflecting a shared evolutionary ancestry that likely arose from an ancient gene duplication event; correspondingly, both kinases exhibit a unique activation loop motif (SEG) and a substitution of the canonical APE motif by an SPR motif in subdomain VIII, features that demarcate the atypical subgroup from classical MAP kinases (kant2006characterizationofthe pages 1-2, coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2). Extensive phylogenetic analyses, such as those documented by Manning et al. (2002) and Manning et al. (2002), further place ERK4 within an evolutionary core that emerged early in eukaryotic evolution and has been conserved throughout vertebrate species, with orthologs present in mammals, birds, and fish (krens2006functionsofthe pages 1-3). Moreover, ERK4 and ERK3 share similarities in exon–intron organization and domain architecture, with the former encoding a 587-amino acid protein in humans and having a stable cellular expression pattern, whereas ERK3 is less stable and subjected to proteasomal turnover via its unique N-terminal degradation signals (rousseau2009caractérisationdela pages 55-59, aberg2006regulationofmapkactivated pages 4-6).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nThe catalytic reaction mediated by MAPK4 is a typical phosphorylation reaction in which ATP is utilized to transfer a phosphate group to serine or threonine residues present on target substrate proteins. In this reaction, ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) are converted into ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺, representing the canonical activity observed for serine/threonine kinases (deleris2008activationloopphosphorylation pages 280-285, aberg2006regulationofmapkactivated pages 9-10).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nMAPK4, like other serine/threonine kinases, requires divalent metal ions—most notably Mg²⁺—as essential cofactors for its catalytic activity during the phosphate group transfer reaction from ATP to its substrates (aberg2006regulationofmapkactivated pages 4-6, jiang2022mitogenactivatedproteinkinase pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nThe substrate specificity of MAPK4 is relatively narrow compared to classical MAPKs. It is documented to phosphorylate microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and, more notably, MAPK-activated protein kinase 5 (MK5) as its primary physiological substrate (aberg2006regulationofmapkactivated pages 7-8, kant2006characterizationofthe pages 1-2). The unique docking interactions between ERK4 and MK5 are mediated by specific regions outside the canonical MAPK docking domain, including a critical FRIEDE motif located within the C-terminal extension that is necessary for the binding and subsequent phosphorylation events (aberg2009dockingofprakmk5 pages 2-3, perander2017regulationofatypical pages 9-10). For serine/threonine kinases, recent high-throughput studies such as the atlas compiled by Johnson et al. (2023) provide insights into consensus substrate motifs, wherein substrate phosphorylation is typically facilitated by recognition of sequence motifs bearing a preference for basic residues upstream and proline enrichment immediately following the phosphoacceptor site; however, specific consensus motifs for MAPK4 have not been explicitly detailed beyond its interaction with MK5 (Johnson2023Nature pages 759-766). In contrast, the substrate specificity of tyrosine kinases is characterized by distinct motifs as shown in the study by Yaron-Barir et al. (2024), but these do not pertain to MAPK4 given its classification as a serine/threonine kinase (Yaron-Barir2024Nature pages 1174-1181).\n\n5. Structure  \nMAPK4 exhibits a central kinase domain that spans the majority of its 587 amino acid sequence as determined by sequence corrections from earlier cloning experiments (aberg2006regulationofmapkactivated pages 4-6). The kinase domain contains all the hallmarks of protein serine/threonine kinases, including an ATP-binding pocket and a catalytic loop, but it is distinguished by an atypical activation loop that contains a single phospho-acceptor residue within a Ser-Glu-Gly (SEG) motif instead of the conventional Thr-Xxx-Tyr (TXY) motif (aberg2006regulationofmapkactivated pages 1-2, kant2006characterizationofthe pages 1-2). Additionally, a significant structural feature of MAPK4 is the substitution of the canonical Ala-Pro-Glu (APE) sequence by a Ser-Pro-Arg (SPR) motif in subdomain VIII, a change that is unique to ERK3/ERK4 and likely important for substrate binding and catalytic regulation (coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 2-4, deleris2008activationloopphosphorylation pages 296-300). The overall three-dimensional organization is consistent with other MAP kinases, comprising a smaller N-terminal lobe largely responsible for ATP binding and a larger C-terminal lobe that contributes to substrate recognition; however, ERK4 contains an extended C-terminal region that is implicated in subcellular targeting and protein–protein interactions (aberg2006regulationofmapkactivated pages 6-7, rousseau2009caractérisationdela pages 144-147). Structural models based on homology and AlphaFold predictions support the presence of conserved features such as a defined C-helix and a hydrophobic spine, which are critical for maintaining catalytic conformation; yet, the extended regions support interactions with regulatory proteins like MK5, distinguishing its regulation from classical MAPKs (lindin2014mitogenactivatedproteinkinaseactivated pages 16-22).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of MAPK4 is achieved predominantly through phosphorylation events in its activation loop and through its interactions with downstream effectors, particularly MK5. Group I p21-activated kinases (PAKs) have been identified as upstream kinases that facilitate the phosphorylation of the key serine residue (Ser186) located in the activation loop of MAPK4, a modification that is indispensable for its catalytic activation and for the formation of a stable complex with MAPKAPK5 (aberg2009dockingofprakmk5 pages 1-2, deleris2008activationloopphosphorylation pages 296-300). Upon binding to MK5, MAPK4 not only phosphorylates MK5 on its activation loop (specifically at Thr182) to promote its activation, but this interaction also results in a reciprocal phosphorylation of MAPK4 itself by MK5, establishing a loop of phosphorylation events that has been proposed to be critical for cell cycle entry (aberg2006regulationofmapkactivated pages 11-12, rousseau2010targetedinactivationof pages 1-2). In addition to activation loop phosphorylation, MAPK4 regulation may also involve its subcellular localization; it is primarily cytoplasmic under basal conditions and is subject to active nuclear export mechanisms that are CRM1-dependent, ensuring that its activity is compartmentalized (aberg2006regulationofmapkactivated pages 6-7, barbagallo2018exploringtheroles pages 24-27). These post-translational modifications, in combination with protein stability control (with ERK4 being notably more stable than ERK3), fine-tune the overall activity of MAPK4 within the cell (rousseau2009caractérisationdela pages 55-59, deleris2008activationloopphosphorylation pages 318-322).\n\n7. Function  \nMAPK4 functions as an atypical MAP kinase whose primary biological role involves the regulation of MAPK-activated protein kinase 5 (MK5), a kinase implicated in processes such as cytoskeletal organization, cell cycle progression, and stress response signaling (aberg2006regulationofmapkactivated pages 7-8, kant2006characterizationofthe pages 1-2). In the MAPK4–MK5 signaling complex, MAPK4 phosphorylates MK5 on Thr182, which is required for MK5’s full activation and cytoplasmic relocalization; in turn, activated MK5 is capable of phosphorylating MAPK4, thereby establishing a bidirectional regulatory loop (aberg2009dockingofprakmk5 pages 1-2, deleris2008activationloopphosphorylation pages 280-285). These phosphorylation events collectively promote entry into the cell cycle, a function inferred by sequence similarity and corroborated by experimental knockdown studies in cellular models (aberg2006regulationofmapkactivated pages 11-12, al2015identificationofnovel pages 33-38). Expression studies have detected MAPK4 in a number of vertebrate tissues including brain, heart, and other organs, and its stability relative to ERK3 suggests that it may exert a sustained regulatory influence in certain cell types; however, knockout mouse studies indicate that its inactivation does not result in gross developmental abnormalities, although subtle phenotypes, such as alterations in cell proliferation or behavior, have been noted (rousseau2009caractérisationdela pages 90-94, barbagallo2018exploringtheroles pages 19-24). The downstream targets of MAPK4 beyond MK5 remain poorly defined, and while MAP2 has been mentioned as a substrate in biochemical studies, the primary established functional pathway involves the MAPK4–MK5 axis that contributes to cytoskeletal dynamics and cell cycle progression (aberg2006regulationofmapkactivated pages 1-2, aberg2009dockingofprakmk5 pages 1-2).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nStudies have detected recurrent mutations within the kinase domain of MAPK4, such as substitutions at critical residues (e.g., R114C/H), which have been found in various cancers including colorectal carcinomas, gliomas, non-small cell lung carcinomas, and melanomas; these mutations point to a potential role of MAPK4 in tumor progression, although the precise functional impact of these mutations remains to be fully elucidated (barbagallo2018exploringtheroles pages 19-24, kant2006characterizationofthe pages 2-3). Inhibitors specific to MAPK4 are not as well characterized as those for classical MAPKs or other kinases, and while its atypical activation mechanisms suggest that targeting its unique docking interactions with MK5 (for instance, the FRIEDE motif-mediated binding) may represent a potential therapeutic strategy, specific small-molecule inhibitors have not yet been advanced into clinical evaluation (dahm2025atypicalmapksin pages 1-3). Furthermore, the interdependent phosphorylation cycle between MAPK4 and MK5, as well as the regulation via CRM1-dependent nuclear export, are considered potential nodes for pharmacological intervention, though the current literature indicates that the biological implications of these regulatory events require further experimental validation (deleris2008activationloopphosphorylation pages 296-300, perander2017regulationofatypical pages 11-12).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nMAPK6, also known as ERK3 or p97‑MAPK, is an atypical member of the mitogen‑activated protein kinase (MAPK) family that diverges significantly from its conventional relatives such as ERK1/2 and p38 in both structure and regulation (coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 2-4). The evolutionary lineage of MAPK6 is firmly established by comparative sequence analyses that reveal its kinase domain has approximately 73% sequence identity with ERK4, a close homolog, indicating that these two kinases likely originated via a gene duplication event early in vertebrate evolution (coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 2-4, kultz1998phylogeneticandfunctional pages 1-2). In phylogenetic trees constructed from the human kinome, MAPK6 clusters with other atypical MAPKs such as ERK4, ERK7, and Nemo-like kinase (NLK), which have evolved distinct activation loop motifs and regulatory domains that set them apart from classical MAPKs (kultz1998phylogeneticandfunctional pages 3-4). Unlike the canonical ERK1/2 subfamily that is characterized by the conserved Thr–Glu–Tyr (TEY) motif in their activation loops, MAPK6 contains a unique Ser–Glu–Gly sequence that serves as its activation motif, thereby providing a molecular signature that distinguishes it within the MAPK superfamily (coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 2-4, kultz1998phylogeneticandfunctional pages 5-9). Orthologs of MAPK6 can be identified across mammalian species, and the conservation of both its catalytic core and its regulatory extensions, such as the unique long C‑terminal tail, strongly supports its maintained functional role throughout vertebrate evolution (kultz1998phylogeneticandfunctional pages 1-2). Studies among chordates have demonstrated that atypical MAPKs like MAPK6 are evolutionarily restricted to higher order organisms as orthologs in invertebrates or plants have not been identified, which further refines its phylogenetic position and suggests a specialized role that emerged along the chordate lineage (coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 2-4, kultz1998phylogeneticandfunctional pages 3-4). Additionally, the overall configuration of the MAPK superfamily, as established by comprehensive studies on the protein kinase complement of the human genome by Manning and colleagues and subsequent analyses of the evolution of protein kinase signaling from yeast to man, positions MAPK6 within a clade that has adapted novel regulatory principles distinct from those of the conventional mitogen-responsive kinases (Manning, G. et al. 2002, Manning, G. et al. 2002) (kultz1998phylogeneticandfunctional pages 5-9). Such analyses underscore that MAPK6’s orthologs and its relative conservation in structure and gene organization between MAPK6 and ERK4 provide a robust phylogenetic framework that supports its classification as a member of the ERK3/ERK4 subgroup (coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 2-4). Collectively, these evolutionary observations suggest that MAPK6’s diversification from canonical MAPK signaling cascades occurred early in vertebrate history and that its unique domain features have been conserved due to specialized cellular functions that have emerged in chordates (kultz1998phylogeneticandfunctional pages 1-2, kultz1998phylogeneticandfunctional pages 3-4).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nMAPK6 functions as a serine/threonine protein kinase, catalyzing the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of specific serine or threonine residues on target substrates (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8). The general chemical reaction underlying its kinase activity can be represented as follows:  \n ATP + [protein]‑(L‑serine or L‑threonine) → ADP + [protein]‑(L‑serine/threonine)‑phosphate + H⁺ (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8).  \nThis enzymatic reaction is central to the propagation of intracellular signals, as the phosphorylation event induces conformational changes in substrate proteins, thereby altering their activity, interactions, or localization (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of MAPK6 is critically dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions, with Mg²⁺ being the required cofactor. Mg²⁺ ions function by coordinating the β- and γ-phosphates of ATP within the kinase’s catalytic cleft, ensuring the proper orientation of the nucleotide for the efficient transfer of the phosphate group to the substrate (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8). This requirement is in line with the general biochemical features observed in serine/threonine kinases, where magnesium ions are essential for catalysis and substrate phosphorylation (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nMAPK6 exhibits substrate specificity that is characteristic of serine/threonine kinases within the MAPK family. Studies have identified that MAPK6 phosphorylates microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), a substrate implicated in the regulation of the microtubule network and cytoskeletal dynamics (zhu1994cloningandcharacterization pages 9-10). In addition, MAPK6 interacts with and phosphorylates the MAPK-activated protein kinase MAPKAPK5, establishing a functional signaling complex wherein reciprocal phosphorylation events occur; MAPK6 phosphorylates MAPKAPK5, and in turn, MAPKAPK5 phosphorylates MAPK6 (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 25-26). Detailed analyses using substrate specificity atlases for serine/threonine kinases, such as the study by Johnson et al. (2023), have provided insights into the intrinsic substrate recognition patterns of related kinases, and although a precise consensus motif for MAPK6 has not been fully delineated, these studies indicate that local amino acid sequences surrounding the target serine/threonine residues are critical determinants for efficient substrate recognition (Johnson2023Example pages 3-4). Conversely, investigations into the substrate specificities of human tyrosine kinases, as reported by Yaron-Barir et al. (2024), have underscored different recognition motifs that do not apply to MAPK6, given its exclusive serine/threonine kinase activity (Yaron-Barir2024Example). Consequently, the current evidence suggests that MAPK6 prefers substrates that harbor specific local sequence patterns that are compatible with its active site geometry, particularly those found in its validated targets MAP2 and MAPKAPK5, and these interactions are essential for mediating its downstream signaling functions (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 25-26, coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 2-4).\n\n5. Structure  \nMAPK6 displays a modular structure that combines both conserved kinase elements with unique features that differentiate it from classical MAPKs. Its central kinase domain is organized into two lobes: a smaller N-terminal lobe primarily composed of β‑sheets and a larger C‑terminal lobe predominantly formed by α‑helices; the catalytic cleft located between these lobes is the site of ATP binding and substrate phosphorylation (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8, coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 2-4). Within this kinase domain, several catalytic residues are highly conserved among serine/threonine kinases, including those responsible for binding Mg²⁺ and coordinating the ATP phosphates, which are essential for catalysis (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8). One of the hallmark features of MAPK6 is its atypical activation loop. In contrast to conventional MAPKs that carry a dual phosphorylation motif such as the TEY sequence, MAPK6 possesses a Ser–Glu–Gly motif; the serine residue at position 189 within this motif is subject to phosphorylation in vivo and is central to the kinase’s activity (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8, coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 2-4).  \nAnother significant structural attribute of MAPK6 is its extended C‑terminal tail, which comprises approximately 178 additional amino acids. This C‑terminal extension is not present in conventional MAPKs such as ERK1/2, and it is believed to confer specialized functions, particularly by mediating interactions with proteins such as MAPKAPK5, thereby contributing to the assembly of the MAPK6–MAPKAPK5 complex (coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 4-6). Structural models based on homology modeling and predictions from platforms like AlphaFold indicate that although the overall fold of the kinase domain in MAPK6 conforms to the classical bilobal architecture observed in other kinases, there are distinct divergences in regions such as subdomain VIII, where a unique Ser–Pro–Arg motif has been identified; such motifs may influence both substrate recognition and the stability of the catalytic domain (kultz1998phylogeneticandfunctional pages 5-9, coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 2-4). Furthermore, alterations in subdomain XI and modified residues along the C‑helix could affect the conformational dynamics and regulatory interactions of MAPK6 when compared to its conventional counterparts (coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 4-6, kultz1998phylogeneticandfunctional pages 5-9). Overall, the structural organization of MAPK6—with its conserved kinase domain core, atypical activation loop bearing a unique Ser–Glu–Gly motif, and an expanded C‑terminal tail—provides a molecular basis for its distinct regulatory and substrate-recognition properties that define it as an atypical MAPK (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8, coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 2-4).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulatory mechanisms that govern MAPK6 activity integrate both post-translational modifications and controlled protein turnover. Central to its regulation is the phosphorylation of the activation loop, particularly at serine 189, a modification that is crucial for activation of MAPK6’s kinase function (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8). Studies have demonstrated that MAPK6 can undergo autophosphorylation at this residue, although there is also a possibility that an as-yet-unidentified upstream kinase may facilitate this modification under specific cellular conditions (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8, coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 11-12).  \nIn addition to phosphorylation-dependent activation, MAPK6 is subject to tight regulation by protein turnover mechanisms. The N-terminal domain of MAPK6 has been implicated in mediating rapid polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation via the ubiquitin–proteasome system, resulting in a short half‑life for the active kinase in proliferating cells (coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 4-6, ronkina2019germlinedeletion pages 20-23). This regulated degradation ensures that MAPK6 activity remains transient and is modulated in accordance with cellular needs.  \nFurthermore, the formation of a signaling complex with MAPKAPK5 adds an additional layer of regulation to MAPK6. Within this complex, reciprocal phosphorylation events occur: MAPK6 phosphorylates MAPKAPK5 to promote its activation, while MAPKAPK5 can, in turn, phosphorylate MAPK6. Such mutual modifications are thought to modulate the activity, subcellular localization, and functional output of both kinases (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 25-26, ronkina2019germlinedeletion pages 20-23). The atypical regulation of MAPK6, which bypasses the classical MAP2K-mediated dual phosphorylation cascade seen for other MAPKs, highlights its unique role in bypassing conventional kinase activation pathways (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8, coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 11-12). These integrated regulatory mechanisms, encompassing both post-translational modifications and proteolytic control, are essential for fine-tuning MAPK6 activity within the dynamic cellular environment (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8).\n\n7. Function  \nMAPK6 plays multiple roles in intracellular signaling as an atypical MAP kinase. Biochemically, it phosphorylates specific substrates including microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and MAPKAPK5, thereby influencing both cytoskeletal organization and cell cycle progression (zhu1994cloningandcharacterization pages 9-10, cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 25-26). MAP2 phosphorylation is indicative of a function in regulating the stability and organization of microtubules and, by extension, aspects of cellular morphology and intracellular transport (zhu1994cloningandcharacterization pages 9-10).  \nThe MAPK6–MAPKAPK5 complex is integral to the modulation of cell cycle entry, as phosphorylation events within this complex promote the activation of downstream pathways that lead to cell proliferation. Experimental studies indicate that the formation of this signaling complex and the reciprocal phosphorylation between MAPK6 and MAPKAPK5 are associated with the promotion of cell cycle entry, suggesting a role in regulating cellular growth (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 25-26, tang1998theroleof pages 31-35).  \nExpression analyses across various tissues have shown that MAPK6 is ubiquitously expressed with higher levels observed in differentiated neuronal and muscle tissues, implicating it in developmental processes and tissue-specific functions (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8, cobb1991extracellularsignalregulatedkinases pages 5-6). Genetic studies, including germ line deletion and knockdown experiments, have further demonstrated that loss of MAPK6 function correlates with developmental defects and deranged cell proliferation, thereby underscoring its importance in embryogenesis and growth regulation (ronkina2019germlinedeletion pages 1-4, tang1998theroleof pages 31-35).  \nWhile the precise upstream activators of MAPK6 remain less well characterized compared to classical MAPK pathways, its regulation appears to occur independently of the canonical MAP2K pathways. Nonetheless, the downstream effects of activated MAPK6 appear to converge on functions that regulate cytoskeletal integrity and promote cell cycle progression, suggesting that MAPK6 serves as a critical node in signaling cascades that control both structural and proliferative cellular processes (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8, cobb1991extracellularsignalregulatedkinases pages 5-6). Additionally, the reciprocal regulation between MAPK6 and MAPKAPK5 implies that MAPK6 may serve not only as an active kinase but also as a molecular scaffold that organizes signaling complexes to ensure the proper temporal and spatial coordination of downstream phosphorylation events (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 25-26, coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 2-4).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nDespite intense research efforts, there are currently no selective chemical inhibitors that specifically target MAPK6. This lack of selective inhibitors represents a significant challenge to detailed pharmacological studies and the therapeutic modulation of MAPK6 activity (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8, tang1998theroleof pages 31-35). Furthermore, while MAPK6’s roles in regulating developmental processes and cell cycle progression suggest a potential impact on growth disorders and oncogenesis, explicit disease associations have not been conclusively established in available studies (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8, ronkina2019germlinedeletion pages 1-4). There are also no reports of specific disease-associated mutations within MAPK6, and the complex interplay between MAPK6 and MAPKAPK5 is still under active investigation, which further limits the current understanding of its clinical significance (coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 11-12, ronkina2019germlinedeletion pages 1-4). Continued research is necessary to elucidate the detailed substrate motifs, regulatory binding interactions, and potential therapeutic avenues related to MAPK6, especially given its atypical mode of regulation and structural divergence from classical MAPKs (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8, coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 4-6).\n\n9.

The upstream activator of MAPK7 is the MAPK kinase MAP2K5. Upon activation, it translocates to the nucleus and phosphorylates various downstream targets including MEF2C. EGF activates MAPK7 through a Ras-independent and MAP2K5-dependent pathway. As part of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, acts as a negative regulator of apoptosis in cardiomyocytes via interaction with STUB1/CHIP and promotion of STUB1-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of ICER-type isoforms of CREM (By similarity). May have a role in muscle cell differentiation. May be important for endothelial function and maintenance of blood vessel integrity. MAP2K5 and MAPK7 interact specifically with one another and not with MEK1/ERK1 or MEK2/ERK2 pathways.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nMitogen‐activated protein kinase 7 (MAPK7), frequently referred to as Big MAP kinase 1, ERK5, or PRKM7, is a member of the mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, which is situated within the CMGC group of eukaryotic protein kinases. Orthologs of MAPK7 are conserved throughout metazoan species, with comprehensive genome‐wide analyses demonstrating that vertebrates retain a conserved version of MAPK7 that emerged early in evolution (andrade2011eukaryoticproteinkinases pages 14-15, kultz1998phylogeneticandfunctional pages 4-5). Detailed phylogenetic studies, including those surveying the protein kinase complement of the human genome, have shown that MAPK7 clusters with canonical MAP kinases and is readily distinguished from the classical ERK1/ERK2 paralogs. This divergence is largely attributable to its exclusive activation by MAP2K5 (also known as MEK5) rather than by the more ubiquitous MEK1/ERK1 or MEK2/ERK2 cascades. Such specialization establishes a discrete MAP2K5–MAPK7 signaling module that is conserved in evolution and has been linked to tissue-specific signaling in multicellular organisms (krupa2002therepertoireof pages 2-3, lai2015investigationsofthe pages 1-6, orand2023revealingthemechanismc pages 33-38).  \n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nMAPK7 catalyzes an ATP-dependent phosphorylation reaction wherein the γ-phosphate group from ATP is transferred to specific serine or threonine residues on target substrate proteins. The chemical reaction can be described as:  \n  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺.  \nThis reversible enzymatic process is characteristic of serine/threonine kinases and is critical for modulating the activity, conformation, and function of downstream target proteins (andrade2011eukaryoticproteinkinases pages 14-15, roskoski2012mek12dualspecificityprotein pages 6-6).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of MAPK7 is dependent on the presence of divalent metal cations, with Mg²⁺ serving as the principal cofactor. Mg²⁺ ions coordinate with ATP in the active site of the enzyme, thereby facilitating the proper alignment of the phosphoryl group for efficient transfer to the substrate. This requirement for Mg²⁺ is widely observed among serine/threonine kinases and is essential for stabilizing the transition state during the phosphorylation reaction (champion2004reassessingthemap3k pages 6-6, andrade2011eukaryoticproteinkinases pages 14-15, krupa2002therepertoireof pages 10-11, roskoski2012mek12dualspecificityprotein pages 6-6).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nMAPK7 exhibits substrate specificity defined by its preference for phosphorylating serine/threonine residues that reside within proline-directed motifs. Peptide microarray studies and large-scale substrate specificity profiling have revealed that MAPK7 preferentially recognizes consensus motifs such as PX[S/T]P, in which a proline residue located immediately C-terminal (+1 position) to the phosphorylated serine or threonine is critical for substrate recognition and efficient catalysis. This proline-directed specificity enables MAPK7 to selectively target physiological substrates, including transcription factors such as MEF2C and regulatory kinases such as SGK1. In particular, phosphorylation of SGK1 at Ser-78 by MAPK7 is an essential post-translational modification required for growth factor–induced progression through the cell cycle (johnson2023anatlasof pages 1-2, johnson2023anatlasof pages 4-5, johnson2023anatlasof pages 6-7, johnson2023anatlasof pages 7-7, johnson2023anatlasof pages 9-10).\n\n5. Structure  \nMAPK7 is composed of a canonical kinase domain that exhibits a bilobal fold typical of eukaryotic protein kinases. The smaller N-terminal lobe is predominantly made up of β-strands and contains the ATP-binding hinge region, which is crucial for anchoring ATP during catalysis. In contrast, the larger C-terminal lobe is mainly α-helical and houses key regulatory elements. One of the most critical structural features is the activation loop (T-loop), which contains the conserved TEY (Thr-Glu-Tyr) motif. Dual phosphorylation of the TEY motif by the upstream kinase MAP2K5 is necessary for full catalytic activation of MAPK7 (coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 11-12, hunter2015theeukaryoticprotein pages 1-3). In addition to the kinase domain, MAPK7 is structurally unique because it possesses an extended C-terminal non-catalytic region. This region includes a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and several proline-rich motifs that mediate protein–protein interactions, ultimately contributing to transcriptional regulation following nuclear translocation (faezov2023alphafold2modelsof pages 18-20, oleaflores2019extracellularsignalregulatedkinase pages 6-7). Further support for this structural organization comes from AlphaFold2 models, which reveal a well-conserved hydrophobic spine and a critical C-helix in the kinase domain that stabilizes the active conformation by ensuring correct orientation of key catalytic residues (hunter2015theeukaryoticprotein pages 3-6, orand2023revealingthemechanismc pages 33-38).\n\n6. Regulation  \nMAPK7 is regulated primarily through a cascade of phosphorylation events. Its full activation is achieved by the specific upstream kinase MAP2K5 (MEK5), which dual phosphorylates threonine and tyrosine residues within the TEY motif of the activation loop. This phosphorylation induces a conformational change that not only enhances MAPK7’s catalytic activity but also facilitates its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, MAPK7 can phosphorylate its downstream substrates. Beyond phosphorylation, MAPK7 is also subject to regulatory mechanisms involving protein–protein interactions. For instance, binding to the ubiquitin ligase STUB1/CHIP results in the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of ICER-type CREM isoforms. This particular ubiquitination process is responsible for the anti-apoptotic role of MAPK7 in cardiomyocytes. Additionally, MAPK7 has been shown to modulate the tumor suppressor p53 by disrupting the interaction between PML and MDM2, thereby influencing cell cycle progression and apoptotic responses. These multifaceted regulatory mechanisms, involving both phosphorylation and ubiquitination events, ensure that MAPK7 activity is tightly controlled in response to various extracellular signals, such as those from epidermal growth factor (EGF) that stimulate a Ras-independent, MAP2K5-dependent pathway (andrade2011eukaryoticproteinkinases pages 14-15, coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 11-12, lai2016regulatoryrolesof pages 12-14, chrysostomou2020rsk4targetinga pages 54-58, southekal2021integrativeanalysisof pages 114-120, jauch2005themapkinteracting pages 9-13).\n\n7. Function  \nMAPK7 plays a central role in various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and cell survival. As an integral part of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, MAPK7 is activated in response to extracellular stimuli such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) through a Ras-independent pathway that specifically involves MAP2K5. Upon activation, MAPK7 translocates to the nucleus where it phosphorylates key regulatory proteins. One of its notable targets is the transcription factor MEF2C, which is central to the control of gene expression programs that govern muscle cell differentiation and endothelial function. In addition to MEF2C, MAPK7 phosphorylates SGK1 at Ser-78, a modification that is critical for the progression of the cell cycle and, thereby, for promoting cellular proliferation. Moreover, MAPK7 exerts a protective effect in cardiomyocytes by acting as a negative regulator of apoptosis. This anti-apoptotic effect is mediated through its interaction with STUB1/CHIP, which leads to the ubiquitination and degradation of ICER-type CREM isoforms. Furthermore, MAPK7 influences the p53 tumor suppressor pathway by disrupting the PML-MDM2 interaction, thus contributing to the regulation of cell cycle checkpoints and apoptotic responses. These functional roles are not only pivotal for normal cellular physiology, including muscle differentiation and maintenance of vascular integrity, but also have important implications in pathological conditions such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases (chrysostomou2020rsk4targetinga pages 54-58, southekal2021integrativeanalysisof pages 114-120, hunter2015theeukaryoticprotein pages 3-6, johnson2023anatlasof pages 1-2, johnson2023anatlasof pages 7-7).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nAlthough no MAPK7-specific inhibitors have yet been approved for clinical use, MAPK7 remains an attractive target for therapeutic intervention based on its well-defined roles in regulating cellular apoptosis, muscle differentiation, and endothelial function. Current research efforts, which include integrative kinome analyses and virtual screening campaigns, are focused on identifying small-molecule inhibitors that can selectively modulate the MAP2K5–MAPK7 signaling axis. The dysregulation or aberrant activation of MAPK7 has been associated with a range of pathological conditions, notably cardiovascular diseases and several types of cancer. Such associations suggest that MAPK7 may serve both as a diagnostic biomarker and as a therapeutic target. Furthermore, comprehensive analyses have indicated that the specific interaction between MAP2K5 and MAPK7, as well as the distinctive features of MAPK7’s extended C-terminal regulatory domain, set it apart from classical MAP kinases such as ERK1/ERK2. This uniqueness has spurred further studies aimed at understanding its allosteric regulation and at developing highly selective inhibitors (orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 33-38, southekal2021integrativeanalysisof pages 114-120, tubita2020beyondkinaseactivity pages 10-12, wen2024boneandextracellular pages 15-16, wilkinson2020analysisofbrafinhibitor pages 39-44).\n\n9.

Controls both, basal and starvation-induced autophagy throught its interaction with GABARAP, MAP1LC3B and GABARAPL1 leading to autophagosome formation, SQSTM1 degradation and reduced MAP1LC3B inhibitory phosphorylation (PubMed:22948227). Regulates primary cilium formation and the localization of ciliary proteins involved in cilium structure, transport, and signaling (PubMed:29021280). Prevents the relocation of the sugar-adding enzymes from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby restricting the production of sugar-coated proteins (PubMed:24618899). Upon amino-acid starvation, mediates transitional endoplasmic reticulum site disassembly and inhibition of secretion (PubMed:21847093). Binds to chromatin leading to MAPK15 activation and interaction with PCNA, that which protects genomic integrity by inhibiting MDM2-mediated degradation of PCNA (PubMed:20733054). Regulates DA transporter (DAT) activity and protein expression via activation of RhoA (PubMed:28842414). In response to H(2)O(2) treatment phosphorylates ELAVL1, thus preventing it from binding to the PDCD4 3'UTR and rendering the PDCD4 mRNA accessible to miR-21 and leading to its degradation and loss of protein expression (PubMed:26595526). Also functions in a kinase activity-independent manner as a negative regulator of growth (By similarity). Phosphorylates in vitro FOS and MBP (PubMed:11875070, PubMed:16484222, PubMed:19166846, PubMed:20638370). During oocyte maturation, plays a key role in the microtubule organization and meiotic cell cycle progression in oocytes, fertilized eggs, and early embryos (By similarity).

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nMitogen‐activated protein kinase 15 (MAPK15), also known as ERK7 or ERK8, is classified as an atypical member of the MAP kinase family within the human kinome. Phylogenetic analysis based on the protein kinase complement described by Manning et al. (as reflected in johnson2023anatlasof pages 1-2 and li2011evolutionaryhistoryof pages 11-12) shows that MAPK15 diverges significantly from the conventional MAPKs such as ERK1/2 and p38. Its amino acid sequence places it in the broader CMGC group of serine/threonine kinases. In contrast with the well‐conserved catalytic domains of classical MAPKs, MAPK15 has evolved unique regulatory elements that are not found in its canonical counterparts. Orthologs of MAPK15 are present across metazoan species, a pattern that implicates it in an ancient and conserved eukaryotic signaling pathway. Such conservation, despite its divergence in regulatory features, implies that the fundamental roles of MAPK15—especially in controlling autophagy, ciliogenesis, and genome integrity—have been under evolutionary constraint (johnson2023anatlasof pages 1-2, li2011evolutionaryhistoryof pages 11-12, maheshwari2012identificationofconserved pages 66-69).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nMAPK15 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to protein substrates at serine or threonine residues. The chemical reaction can be summarized as follows:  \nATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺  \nThis reaction, typical for serine/threonine kinases, is responsible for the post-translational modification that regulates the activity, stability, and function of numerous substrate proteins (arfelli2023uhmk1isa pages 1-4, o’boyle2025anatlasof pages 27-31).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of MAPK15 is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions. In particular, Mg²⁺ is required as a cofactor since it facilitates the coordination of ATP within the catalytic cleft and promotes the transfer of the γ-phosphate group to the substrate protein (arfelli2023uhmk1isa pages 1-4, o’boyle2025anatlasof pages 27-31).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nMAPK15 functions as a serine/threonine kinase and its substrate specificity has been assessed through large-scale phosphoproteomic studies. Although a definitive consensus sequence for MAPK15 has not been fully elucidated, data from Johnson et al. (2023) place it among those kinases that phosphorylate autophagy‐, ciliogenesis‐, and genome integrity‐associated proteins (johnson2023anatlasof pages 1-2). In vitro experiments have demonstrated that MAPK15 phosphorylates well-known substrates, including the transcription factor FOS and myelin basic protein (MBP) (arfelli2023uhmk1isa pages 4-7, yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 7-8). Moreover, MAPK15 interacts with autophagy-related proteins such as GABARAP, MAP1LC3B, and GABARAPL1. These interactions are critical for stimulating autophagosome formation and for the efficient degradation of the autophagy receptor SQSTM1, with a concomitant reduction in the inhibitory phosphorylation state of MAP1LC3B. This functional association implies that substrate sites phosphorylated by MAPK15 contain sequence elements that are amenable to binding by these autophagy adaptors (arfelli2023uhmk1isa pages 1-4, johnson2023anatlasof pages 7-7).\n\n5. Structure  \nThe three-dimensional structure of MAPK15 comprises a central catalytic kinase domain that exhibits the canonical bilobal arrangement found in most MAP kinases. The smaller N-terminal lobe is mainly composed of antiparallel β-sheets, while the larger C-terminal lobe is dominated by α-helices. Key catalytic features include an activation loop, whose phosphorylation status is critical for triggering conformational changes that convert the kinase into an active state; a DFG motif that coordinates Mg²⁺ in the ATP-binding site; a conserved C-helix essential for catalysis; and a hydrophobic spine that stabilizes the active conformation of the enzyme (strambi2013structurepredictionand pages 13-14, johnson2023anatlasof pages 6-7). In addition to the canonical domain, MAPK15 harbors unique regulatory regions outside the kinase core. For example, its extended C-terminal portion contains sequences such as a nuclear localization signal (NLS) that facilitate binding to chromatin and contribute to subcellular localization. AlphaFold structural predictions further support the presence of these atypical surface features that may be central to interactions with substrates such as PCNA and autophagy adaptors (oleaflores2019extracellularsignalregulatedkinase pages 6-7, o’boyle2025anatlasof pages 1-5, pei2023computationalanalysisof pages 15-16).\n\n6. Regulation  \nMAPK15 is subject to multiple layers of regulation that ensure its activity is tightly controlled in response to cellular conditions. Autophosphorylation within the activation loop is a key event that activates MAPK15. Although no classical upstream MAPK kinase (MAP2K) has been firmly established for MAPK15, evidence indicates that noncanonical kinases, for example RET/PTC3 in certain contexts, may contribute to its activation (shrestha2022theregulationof pages 34-38, strambi2013structurepredictionand pages 14-14). In addition, MAPK15 activity is modulated by its binding to chromatin. This chromatin association enhances its interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and plays a critical role in safeguarding genome integrity by counteracting MDM2-mediated degradation of PCNA (arfelli2023uhmk1isa pages 1-4, southekal2021integrativeanalysisof pages 114-120). Oxidative stress, as induced by hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) treatment, also regulates MAPK15 by promoting its phosphorylation of ELAVL1. This modification prevents ELAVL1 from binding to the PDCD4 mRNA 3′ untranslated region, thereby permitting miR-21-mediated degradation of PDCD4 mRNA (arfelli2023uhmk1isa pages 7-10, shrestha2022theregulationof pages 87-89). Furthermore, MAPK15 interacts with components of the autophagy machinery—namely GABARAP, MAP1LC3B, and GABARAPL1—to regulate both basal and starvation-induced autophagy. In addition to these kinase activity-dependent mechanisms, MAPK15 exhibits kinase activity-independent roles such as functioning as a negative regulator of cellular growth and modulating the trafficking of proteins, exemplified by its ability to inhibit the relocation of sugar-adding enzymes from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum (arfelli2023uhmk1isa pages 1-4, shrestha2022theregulationof pages 28-31).\n\n7. Function  \nMAPK15 plays versatile roles in cellular physiology, carried out predominantly through its kinase activity. A principal function is the regulation of autophagy. MAPK15 interacts with key autophagy-related proteins—GABARAP, MAP1LC3B, and GABARAPL1—to stimulate autophagosome assembly and to promote the degradation of SQSTM1. This process also involves a reduction in the inhibitory phosphorylation of MAP1LC3B, a modification that normally restrains autophagy (arfelli2023uhmk1isa pages 1-4, gomez2024illuminatingfunctionof pages 1-3). Additionally, MAPK15 has a central role in ciliogenesis. It regulates the formation of the primary cilium and ensures the proper localization of ciliary proteins that are essential for maintaining cilium structure, transport functions, and signaling cascades (arfelli2023uhmk1isa pages 12-15, o’boyle2025anatlasof pages 21-24).  \nMAPK15 also participates in protein trafficking and secretion control. It restricts the retrograde movement of sugar-adding enzymes from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum, which in turn limits the synthesis of sugar-coated proteins. Under conditions of amino acid starvation, MAPK15 mediates the disassembly of transitional endoplasmic reticulum sites, which leads to the inhibition of secretion (arfelli2023uhmk1isa pages 35-37, southekal2021integrativeanalysisof pages 19-25).  \nAnother critical function of MAPK15 is the maintenance of genomic integrity. Through its chromatin-binding capacity and interaction with PCNA, MAPK15 protects PCNA from MDM2-mediated degradation, a safeguarding mechanism essential for proper DNA replication and repair (arfelli2023uhmk1isa pages 1-4, southekal2021integrativeanalysisof pages 114-120). Moreover, MAPK15 has been implicated in regulating dopamine transporter (DAT) activity and expression via activation of RhoA, a pathway that influences neuronal signaling (arfelli2023uhmk1isa pages 7-10, higgins2023sarscov2hijacksp38βmapk11 pages 21-23). In response to oxidative stress, MAPK15 phosphorylates the RNA-binding protein ELAVL1; this event disrupts ELAVL1’s interaction with the 3′ UTR of PDCD4 mRNA, facilitating its degradation through miR-21 action, which adds a layer of post-transcriptional gene regulation (arfelli2023uhmk1isa pages 7-10, shrestha2022theregulationof pages 87-89).  \nFurther in vitro studies have established that MAPK15 is capable of phosphorylating substrates such as FOS and MBP, which implicates it in transcriptional regulation and cytoskeletal organization, respectively (arfelli2023uhmk1isa pages 4-7, johnson2023anatlasof pages 12-18). During oocyte maturation and early embryogenesis, MAPK15 is essential for coordinating microtubule organization and progression through the meiotic cell cycle. Additionally, its interaction with the nuclear receptor ESRRA, resulting in the relocalization of ESRRA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, culminates in the inhibition of ESRRA-dependent transcription, thereby influencing differentiation and growth control (arfelli2023uhmk1isa pages 1-4, shrestha2022theregulationof pages 34-38).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nDespite the extensive analysis of MAPK15’s roles in autophagy, ciliogenesis, secretion, and genomic stability, there are presently no highly selective inhibitors specifically targeting MAPK15 reported in the literature (o’boyle2025anatlasof pages 21-24, shah2023limk2amultifaceted pages 1-3). Although dysregulation of MAPK15 has potential implications in cancer biology as well as in neurodegenerative conditions attributable to its roles in maintaining genome integrity and regulating autophagy, specific disease-associated mutations and detailed clinical inhibitor data have not been fully characterized (shrestha2022theregulationof pages 87-89, southekal2021integrativeanalysisof pages 114-120). Recent computational approaches that integrate deep learning and proximity proteomics have begun to offer insights into the kinase-substrate landscape of the human kinome, yet these studies focus on broad substrate prediction rather than the development of selective inhibitors for MAPK15 (jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 20-22). In addition, MAPK15 has been shown to exert kinase activity-independent functions, such as negative regulation of cellular growth, which further complicate the development of therapeutic agents. To date, the complexity of MAPK15’s dual modes of action—both as an active kinase and through scaffold-like mechanisms—remains a subject for continued research.\n\n9.

Extracellular stimuli such as pro-inflammatory cytokines or physical stress stimulate the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAP/JNK) signaling pathway (PubMed:28943315). In this cascade, two dual specificity kinases MAP2K4/MKK4 and MAP2K7/MKK7 phosphorylate and activate MAPK8/JNK1. In turn, MAPK8/JNK1 phosphorylates a number of transcription factors, primarily components of AP-1 such as JUN, JDP2 and ATF2 and thus regulates AP-1 transcriptional activity (PubMed:18307971). Phosphorylates the replication licensing factor CDT1, inhibiting the interaction between CDT1 and the histone H4 acetylase HBO1 to replication origins (PubMed:21856198). Loss of this interaction abrogates the acetylation required for replication initiation (PubMed:21856198). Promotes stressed cell apoptosis by phosphorylating key regulatory factors including p53/TP53 and Yes-associates protein YAP1 (PubMed:21364637). In T-cells, MAPK8 and MAPK9 are required for polarized differentiation of T-helper cells into Th1 cells. Contributes to the survival of erythroid cells by phosphorylating the antagonist of cell death BAD upon EPO stimulation (PubMed:21095239). Mediates starvation-induced BCL2 phosphorylation, BCL2 dissociation from BECN1, and thus activation of autophagy (PubMed:18570871). Phosphorylates STMN2 and hence regulates microtubule dynamics, controlling neurite elongation in cortical neurons (By similarity). In the developing brain, through its cytoplasmic activity on STMN2, negatively regulates the rate of exit from multipolar stage and of radial migration from the ventricular zone (By similarity). Phosphorylates several other substrates including heat shock factor protein 4 (HSF4), the deacetylase SIRT1, ELK1, or the E3 ligase ITCH (PubMed:16581800, PubMed:17296730, PubMed:20027304). Phosphorylates the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer and plays a role in the regulation of the circadian clock (PubMed:22441692). Phosphorylates the heat shock transcription factor HSF1, suppressing HSF1-induced transcriptional activity (PubMed:10747973). Phosphorylates POU5F1, which results in the inhibition of POU5F1's transcriptional activity and enhances its proteasomal degradation (By similarity). Phosphorylates JUND and this phosphorylation is inhibited in the presence of MEN1 (PubMed:22327296). In neurons, phosphorylates SYT4 which captures neuronal dense core vesicles at synapses (By similarity). Phosphorylates EIF4ENIF1/4-ET in response to oxidative stress, promoting P-body assembly (PubMed:22966201). Phosphorylates SIRT6 in response to oxidative stress, stimulating its mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase activity (PubMed:27568560). Phosphorylates NLRP3, promoting assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome (PubMed:28943315). Phosphorylates ALKBH5 in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS), promoting ALKBH5 sumoylation and inactivation (PubMed:34048572)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny:  \nMAPK8, commonly known as JNK1, is a serine/threonine protein kinase that belongs to the Mitogen‐Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) superfamily, more specifically to the stress‐activated protein kinase (SAPK) subgroup (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 1-3, kyriakis2012mammalianmapksignal pages 1-2). Within the SAPK branch, JNK1 is closely related to JNK2 and JNK3, with gene duplication and alternative splicing events generating multiple isoforms that are conserved across vertebrate species (herdegen2005contextspecificinhibitionof pages 1-2, manning2003targetingjnkfor pages 2-3). Phylogenetic reconstruction based on comparative kinase genomic analyses shows that the JNK subfamily has maintained its characteristic dual phosphorylation motif through evolution, likely descending from an ancestral MAPK present in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (liu2016aconservedmotif pages 1-2, li2011evolutionaryhistoryof pages 11-12). This evolutionary conservation is further supported by deep phylogenetic studies that group JNK1 with other MAPKs sharing similar activation loop motifs and catalytic domain organization (orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 175-178, kyriakis2012mammalianmapksignal pages 2-3).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed:  \nMAPK8/JNK1 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues in target proteins. The overall reaction is as follows: ATP + [protein]–(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]–(phospho-L-serine/threonine) + H⁺ (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 1-3).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements:  \nThe kinase activity of MAPK8/JNK1 requires divalent metal ions, most notably Mg²⁺, which facilitates the binding and proper orientation of ATP in the catalytic cleft (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 1-3).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity:  \nMAPK8/JNK1 is a serine/threonine kinase that preferentially phosphorylates substrates containing serine or threonine residues immediately followed by a proline (Ser/Thr-Pro motifs). This preference is exemplified by its phosphorylation of the transcription factor c-Jun at Ser63 and Ser73, leading to modulation of AP-1 transcriptional activity (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 1-3, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 1-2). Recent comprehensive analyses of kinase substrate specificities have polished the consensus motif for human serine/threonine kinases to an extended model that includes flanking basic residues in some contexts (Johnson2023Atlas pages 1-?); while for tyrosine kinases the intrinsic substrate specificity has been mapped as well, although these data are less directly applicable to MAPK8/JNK1 (Yaron-Barir2024 pages 1-?). Therefore, for JNK1 the core determinant is the proline-directed motif, with additional context provided by docking interactions that enhance specificity toward substrates such as JUN, ATF2, and others (davis2000signaltransductionby pages 2-3, herdegen2005contextspecificinhibitionof pages 2-4).\n\n5. Structure:  \nMAPK8/JNK1 adopts the typical bilobal structure characteristic of MAP kinases. Its central kinase domain is divided into an N-terminal lobe composed primarily of β‑sheets and a C-terminal lobe dominated by α‑helices. The active site is located in the cleft between these lobes and contains a highly conserved ATP-binding pocket, a catalytic loop, and an activation loop that harbors the Thr-Pro-Tyr (T-P-Y) motif, which must undergo dual phosphorylation for full catalytic activation (heo2004structuralbasisfor pages 1-2, orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 33-38). This kinase also contains a conserved docking groove that facilitates the interaction with specific short linear motifs (SLiMs) in substrate proteins and scaffold proteins such as JIP1; these interactions modulate substrate binding and improve catalytic efficiency (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 2-3, heo2004structuralbasisfor pages 11-11). Additional structural features include the hydrophobic spine and the C-helix, which are essential for maintaining the active conformation of the kinase and its proper allosteric regulation (orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 41-45).\n\n6. Regulation:  \nMAPK8/JNK1 is regulated primarily through phosphorylation by dual-specificity MAPK kinases, specifically MKK4 and MKK7, which phosphorylate the Tyr185 and Thr183 residues in its activation loop, respectively (ansideri2018multiplestrategiestargeting pages 38-42, park2019mkk7theessential pages 1-2). In addition to this dual phosphorylation, JNK1 activity is modulated by scaffold proteins, such as members of the JIP family, that spatially and temporally coordinate the assembly of the upstream kinases (MKKKs and MAP2Ks) with JNK1 and its substrates (johnson2007thecjunkinasestressactivated pages 5-6, orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 175-178). Negative regulation is mediated by dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) that dephosphorylate JNK1 and, consequently, downregulate its signaling output (ha2019phosphorylationdynamicsof pages 6-7, zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 1-2). Under conditions of cellular stress, such as oxidative stress or UV irradiation, additional regulatory inputs including ubiquitination and caspase-mediated cleavage may occur, which can either enhance or attenuate JNK1 signaling (silva2005mixedlineagekinase–c‐jun pages 2-3, yan2024theroleof pages 7-8).\n\n7. Function:  \nMAPK8/JNK1 plays diverse roles in cellular processes and signal transduction pathways. It is a key mediator in the SAPK/JNK signaling cascade, where its activation leads to the phosphorylation of numerous downstream substrates including transcription factors such as c-Jun, ATF2, and JDP2; these phosphorylation events modulate gene expression in response to extracellular stress stimuli such as pro-inflammatory cytokines and physical stress (ansideri2018multiplestrategiestargeting pages 38-42, barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 1-3). In addition, MAPK8/JNK1 phosphorylates substrates involved in cell cycle regulation and DNA replication, such as the replication licensing factor CDT1; this phosphorylation disrupts the interaction between CDT1 and histone acetylase HBO1, thereby inhibiting replication initiation (ansideri2018multiplestrategiestargeting pages 38-42). JNK1 also promotes apoptosis under prolonged stress by phosphorylating regulators including p53 and YAP1 (ansideri2018multiplestrategiestargeting pages 38-42). In T-cells, both JNK1 and the related kinase MAPK9 are required for the proper polarization of T-helper cells into Th1 cells, indicating a role in adaptive immunity (bogoyevitch2004targetingthejnk pages 1-2). Moreover, MAPK8/JNK1 contributes to cell survival signals in erythroid cells by phosphorylating the pro-apoptotic protein BAD following erythropoietin (EPO) stimulation (ansideri2018multiplestrategiestargeting pages 38-42). Additional functions include modulation of autophagy through phosphorylation of BCL2, regulation of microtubule dynamics via phosphorylation of STMN2, and even involvement in the regulation of the circadian clock by targeting the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer (ansideri2018multiplestrategiestargeting pages 38-42, yan2024theroleof pages 2-4). These activities underscore the central role of JNK1 in transducing stress signals and modulating a diverse array of cellular responses (davis2000signaltransductionby pages 1-2, mehan2011jnkastressactivated pages 2-4).\n\n8. Other Comments:  \nSeveral inhibitors of MAPK8/JNK1 have been identified, including ATP-competitive molecules such as SP600125 and novel reversible covalent inhibitors that target specific cysteine residues outside the conserved active site (balint2024reversiblecovalentcjun pages 17-18, sammons2018unconventionalapproachesto pages 17-20). Although these inhibitors have shown promise experimentally, their selectivity compared to other MAPK isoforms remains a challenge due to the high conservation of the ATP-binding pocket (heo2004structuralbasisfor pages 1-2, yan2024theroleof pages 22-23). Dysregulation of MAPK8/JNK1 signaling is implicated in multiple human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, chronic inflammation, autoimmune diseases, and metabolic syndromes (yan2024theroleof pages 1-2, silva2005mixedlineagekinase–c‐jun pages 2-3). Notable disease-associated mutations in JNK1 itself are rarely reported; however, altered upstream regulation via MAP2Ks and failures in dephosphorylation by DUSPs contribute to aberrant signaling linked to these pathologies (ha2019phosphorylationdynamicsof pages 6-7, zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 1-2). The ongoing development of more selective inhibitors and allosteric modulators holds therapeutic potential for targeting the specific aspects of JNK1-mediated signaling (balint2024reversiblecovalentcjun pages 17-18).\n\n9.

In this cascade, two dual specificity kinases MAP2K4/MKK4 and MAP2K7/MKK7 phosphorylate and activate MAPK9/JNK2 (PubMed:10376527, PubMed:15805466, PubMed:17525747, PubMed:19675674, PubMed:20595622, PubMed:21364637, PubMed:22441692, PubMed:34048572). In turn, MAPK9/JNK2 phosphorylates a number of transcription factors, primarily components of AP-1 such as JUN and ATF2 and thus regulates AP-1 transcriptional activity (PubMed:10376527). In response to oxidative or ribotoxic stresses, inhibits rRNA synthesis by phosphorylating and inactivating the RNA polymerase 1-specific transcription initiation factor RRN3 (PubMed:15805466). Promotes stressed cell apoptosis by phosphorylating key regulatory factors including TP53 and YAP1 (PubMed:17525747, PubMed:21364637). In T-cells, MAPK8 and MAPK9 are required for polarized differentiation of T-helper cells into Th1 cells (PubMed:19290929). Upon T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, is activated by CARMA1, BCL10, MAP2K7 and MAP3K7/TAK1 to regulate JUN protein levels (PubMed:19290929). Plays an important role in the osmotic stress-induced epithelial tight-junctions disruption (PubMed:20595622). When activated, promotes beta-catenin/CTNNB1 degradation and inhibits the canonical Wnt signaling pathway (PubMed:19675674). Also participates in neurite growth in spiral ganglion neurons (By similarity). Phosphorylates the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer and plays a role in the regulation of the circadian clock (PubMed:22441692). Phosphorylates POU5F1, which results in the inhibition of POU5F1's transcriptional activity and enhances its proteasomal degradation (By similarity). Phosphorylates ALKBH5 in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS), promoting ALKBH5 sumoylation and inactivation (PubMed:34048572)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny:  \nMAPK9, commonly known as JNK2, is a member of the c‐Jun N‐terminal kinase (JNK) subgroup within the larger mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) family and is highly conserved across eukaryotes (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 1-2, Manning2002Protein).  \nJNK2 shares a high degree of sequence identity with its paralogs JNK1 and JNK3, and it belongs to the CMGC group of kinases that includes cyclin‐dependent kinases (CDKs), glycogen synthase kinases (GSKs), and other stress‐responsive kinases (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 2-3, Manning2002Evolution).  \nOrthologs of MAPK9 exist in other mammalian species, and its conservation extends to other vertebrates, placing it within an evolutionary core set of MAP kinases that originated in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 1-2, Manning2002Protein).  \nPhylogenetic reconstructions indicate that the JNK group diverged from the other MAPK subfamilies early in evolution, and its relatedness to other stress-activated kinases emphasizes both its functional specialization and the common ancestry shared by the MAPK superfamily (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 2-3, Manning2002Evolution).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed:  \nMAPK9 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues on target proteins, thereby converting ATP to ADP and producing a phosphorylated substrate along with a proton (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 1-2, pearson2001mitogenactivatedprotein(map) pages 1-2).  \nThe general chemical reaction is: ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements:  \nThe catalytic activity of MAPK9 is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions, with Mg²⁺ being required for optimal kinase function (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 1-2, pearson2001mitogenactivatedprotein(map) pages 1-2).  \nThis requirement is shared by nearly all protein kinases, which utilize Mg²⁺ as a cofactor to facilitate ATP binding and phosphoryl transfer (cuschieri2005mitogenactivatedproteinkinase pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity:  \nMAPK9 displays substrate specificity that is characteristic of proline-directed serine/threonine kinases, preferentially phosphorylating substrates containing a serine or threonine residue immediately followed by a proline residue, commonly referred to as the S/T-P motif (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 1-2, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 9-10).  \nIn addition to the minimal S/T-P motif, substrate recognition is further enhanced by docking interactions; many substrates possess specific docking domains, such as D-motifs, which interact with complementary binding grooves on MAPK9 and contribute to its high degree of substrate specificity (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 4-6, yasuda1999thejipgroup pages 1-2).  \nRecent analyses of the substrate specificity landscape for serine/threonine kinases, as reported by Johnson et al. (2023), support that MAPK9 prefers substrates with flanking basic residues and hydrophobic features surrounding the S/T-P core (Johnson2023Atlas).  \n\n5. Structure:  \nThe three-dimensional structure of MAPK9 is characterized by a conserved bilobal kinase fold consisting of a smaller N-terminal lobe mainly composed of β-sheets and a larger C-terminal lobe enriched in α-helices, with the ATP-binding cleft located at their interface (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 2-3, chen2011mapk9(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2).  \nA key structural element is the activation loop, which contains the conserved Thr-Pro-Tyr (TPY) motif whose dual phosphorylation is essential for inducing conformational changes that enable substrate access and catalytic activity (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 2-3, wada2004mitogenactivatedproteinkinases pages 1-2).  \nMAPK9 also possesses a docking groove formed by residues on the kinase surface that interacts with D-motifs on substrates and scaffold proteins, thereby facilitating efficient substrate recruitment (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 4-6, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 7-9).  \nThe catalytic core includes a glycine-rich loop important for ATP binding, a well-conserved catalytic loop with a key aspartic acid residue required for phosphoryl transfer, and a C-helix whose positioning is critical for the regulation of enzyme activity (niu2007kineticcharacterizationof pages 1-2, pearson2001mitogenactivatedprotein(map) pages 5-6).  \nStructural studies, including those using crystallographic and AlphaFold models, reveal that while the overall fold is conserved with other MAP kinases, subtle conformational variations in the docking site and activation loop may underlie isoform-specific substrate recognition and kinetics (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 7-9, niu2007kineticcharacterizationof pages 8-9).\n\n6. Regulation:  \nThe regulatory mechanisms governing MAPK9 activity are multifaceted, centering on its activation by dual phosphorylation of the TPY motif within the activation loop by the upstream dual-specificity kinases MAP2K4 (MKK4) and MAP2K7 (MKK7) (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 2-3, cuschieri2005mitogenactivatedproteinkinase pages 1-2).  \nThis dual phosphorylation event induces a conformational change that enhances the accessibility of the catalytic site and enables efficient substrate binding and catalysis (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 4-6, wada2004mitogenactivatedproteinkinases pages 1-2).  \nRegulation is further modulated by scaffold proteins such as JIP1, which organize MAPK modules by binding MAPK9 along with its upstream activators and substrates, thereby increasing the specificity and efficiency of signal transduction (yasuda1999thejipgroup pages 1-2, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 28-29).  \nFurthermore, post-translational modifications beyond phosphorylation, including ubiquitination and sumoylation of interacting partners, can influence the stability and activity of MAPK9 indirectly by affecting scaffold assembly and substrate availability (chen2011mapk9(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 20-22).  \nExperimental evidence using specific inhibitors such as SP600125 demonstrates that inhibition of MAPK9 activity leads to decreased phosphorylation of key downstream substrates, confirming its role in mediating stress responses (stebbins2008identificationofa pages 1-2, hammaker2004regulationofcjun pages 1-2).\n\n7. Function:  \nMAPK9 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of diverse cellular processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, transformation, and programmed cell death (apoptosis) by modulating the activity of multiple transcription factors and other regulatory proteins (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 1-2, chen2011mapk9(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2).  \nA major function of MAPK9 is the phosphorylation of components of the AP-1 transcription factor complex, such as c-Jun and ATF2, leading to altered gene expression in response to extracellular stress stimuli including pro-inflammatory cytokines, UV irradiation, and osmotic stress (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 1-2, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 26-27).  \nIn addition, MAPK9 is involved in the cellular response to oxidative and ribotoxic stress by phosphorylating the RNA polymerase I-specific transcription initiation factor RRN3, thereby inhibiting rRNA synthesis (chen2011mapk9(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 2-3).  \nMAPK9 promotes apoptosis under stress conditions by phosphorylating key regulatory factors such as TP53 and YAP1, and it also plays an essential role in T-cell receptor signaling that is critical for the polarization of T-helper cells towards a Th1 phenotype (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 20-22, hammaker2004regulationofcjun pages 1-2).  \nAdditional functional roles of MAPK9 include the regulation of epithelial tight junctions in response to osmotic stress, promotion of beta-catenin degradation leading to inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling, and modulation of circadian rhythms through phosphorylation of the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 1-2, hammaker2004regulationofcjun pages 6-7).  \nMoreover, by phosphorylating transcription factors such as POU5F1 (OCT4) and ALKBH5, MAPK9 influences stem cell maintenance and the cellular response to reactive oxygen species, respectively, thereby impacting cell fate decisions and stress adaptation (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 20-22, chen2011mapk9(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2).\n\n8. Other Comments:  \nMAPK9 is a target of considerable pharmacological interest, and several small molecule inhibitors, most notably SP600125, have been used in experimental settings to attenuate its activity in disease models such as rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders (stebbins2008identificationofa pages 1-2, hammaker2004regulationofcjun pages 1-2).  \nDysregulation of MAPK9 signaling has been associated with a variety of pathological conditions, including inflammatory diseases, metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance, and certain cancers, highlighting its significance as a therapeutic target (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 1-2, pritchard2013molecularpathwaysmitogenactivated pages 2-3).  \nNo single inhibitor exhibits absolute specificity for MAPK9, and current compounds often display off-target effects; therefore, ongoing efforts are aimed at developing more selective inhibitors that can modulate MAPK9 activity with minimal interference in related MAPK families (stebbins2008identificationofa pages 1-2, wada2004mitogenactivatedproteinkinases pages 1-2).  \nNotable disease mutations specifically affecting MAPK9 have not been widely reported, but alterations in upstream regulatory components of the JNK signaling cascade may indirectly impact its function in pathological states (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 2-3, hammaker2004regulationofcjun pages 6-7).\n\n9.

    "answer": "Question: # Information\n\n**Protein Name: Mitogen-activated protein kinase 10 / gene: MAPK10 JNK3; JNK3A; PRKM10; SAPK1B**\n**Uniprot Id: P53779**\n**Protein alternative names: MAP kinase p49 3F12; Stress-activated protein kinase 1b; Stress-activated protein kinase JNK3; c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3**\n**Protein Function: Serine/threonine-protein kinase involved in various processes such as neuronal proliferation, differentiation, migration and programmed cell death. Extracellular stimuli such as pro-inflammatory cytokines or physical stress stimulate the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAP/JNK) signaling pathway. In this cascade, two dual specificity kinases MAP2K4/MKK4 and MAP2K7/MKK7 phosphorylate and activate MAPK10/JNK3. In turn, MAPK10/JNK3 phosphorylates a number of transcription factors, primarily components of AP-1 such as JUN and ATF2 and thus regulates AP-1 transcriptional activity. Plays regulatory roles in the signaling pathways during neuronal apoptosis. Phosphorylates the neuronal microtubule regulator STMN2.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nMitogen‐activated protein kinase 10 (MAPK10), more commonly known as JNK3 (also referred to as JNK3A, PRKM10, SAPK1B, or MAP kinase p49 3F12), is a member of the expansive mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) family that comprises numerous serine/threonine protein kinases involved in cellular signal transduction (al.)2002mitogenactivatedproteinkinase pages 3-3). Within this family, MAPK10 is specifically categorized in the c‐Jun N‐terminal kinase (JNK) subgroup that also includes the ubiquitously expressed isoforms JNK1 (MAPK8) and JNK2 (MAPK9); however, MAPK10 is distinguished by its predominant expression in neuronal tissues (al.)2002mitogenactivatedproteinkinase pages 6-7). Evolutionary studies, including those analyzing the protein kinase complement of the human genome, indicate that the JNK subgroup is nested within the larger CMGC group, which unites cyclin‐dependent kinases (CDKs), glycogen synthase kinases (GSKs), CDC‐like kinases (CLKs) and other kinases that share highly conserved catalytic motifs and overall sequence similarity (al.)2002mitogenactivatedproteinkinase pages 3-3). Gene duplication events early in metazoan evolution have paved the way for the diversification of the JNK family, whereby MAPK10 evolved to serve specialized roles in the nervous system; orthologs of MAPK10 have been identified across a diverse range of species from invertebrates to mammals, underscoring its evolutionary conservation and adaptation for mediating stress‐activated responses in neural contexts (krishna2008thecomplexityof pages 1-2, al.)2002mitogenactivatedproteinkinase pages 3-3).  \n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nMAPK10 functions as a serine/threonine protein kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of target proteins by transferring the γ‐phosphate group from ATP to hydroxyl groups on serine or threonine residues. The chemical reaction can be described by the classical scheme:  \n  ATP + [protein]-(L‑serine or L‑threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(phospho‑L‑serine or phospho‑L‑threonine) + H⁺ (al.)2002mitogenactivatedproteinkinase pages 3-3). This reaction is fundamental to the regulation of downstream signaling processes, as the addition of a phosphate moiety modulates the activity, stability, and subcellular localization of various substrates involved in cellular stress and apoptotic pathways.\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe enzymatic activity of MAPK10 is critically dependent on the presence of divalent metal cations. In particular, magnesium (Mg²⁺) serves as an essential cofactor by binding to ATP in the active site, thereby stabilizing the molecule and properly orienting its γ‐phosphate for transfer to the target serine or threonine residue (coffey2014nuclearandcytosolic pages 1-2). This requirement is a hallmark of serine/threonine kinases and is shared by all members of the MAPK family.\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nExperimental substrate specificity studies for human serine/threonine kinases demonstrate that MAPK10 has a marked preference for phosphorylating serine or threonine residues immediately followed by a proline residue, giving rise to the minimal consensus phosphorylation motif [S/T]P. This proline-directed specificity is a defining characteristic of the JNK subgroup and is critical for the phosphorylation of key substrates, especially transcription factors that are part of the activator protein 1 (AP‑1) complex, such as c‑Jun and ATF2 (ha2019phosphorylationdynamicsof pages 1-3). In addition, further refinement of substrate recognition is conferred by surrounding amino acids – for instance, basic residues at positions –3 and –2 relative to the phosphorylated residue can enhance substrate affinity and catalytic turnover, although the prime requisite remains the presence of the proline at the +1 position (johnson2023anatlasof pages 4-4, ha2019phosphorylationdynamicsof pages 1-3). These critical features enable MAPK10 to selectively target substrates that regulate cellular stress responses and neuronal apoptosis.\n\n5. Structure  \nMAPK10 adopts the canonical two‐lobed structure characteristic of MAP kinases. Its structure is organized into a small N-terminal lobe that consists predominantly of β-sheets and contains a glycine-rich loop (G-loop) which confers the flexibility needed for ATP binding, and a larger C-terminal lobe that is mainly α-helical and provides the platform for substrate binding and catalysis (al.)2002mitogenactivatedproteinkinase pages 6-7). The enzyme’s central catalytic domain houses an activation loop that contains the conserved Thr–Pro–Tyr (TPY) motif; dual phosphorylation of the threonine and tyrosine residue within this loop by the upstream kinases MAP2K4 (MKK4) and MAP2K7 (MKK7) triggers a conformational rearrangement that transitions MAPK10 from an inactive to an active state (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 4-6, bogoyevitch2010cjunnterminalkinase pages 6-7). This phosphorylation realigns critical catalytic residues, stabilizes the formation of a hydrophobic spine, and optimizes the conformation of the C-helix to establish a properly configured ATP-binding pocket. Beyond its catalytic domain, MAPK10 contains several docking grooves and D-domains that facilitate high-affinity interactions with substrates, scaffold proteins, and upstream activators; these regions, although distinct from the catalytic cleft, are pivotal for ensuring signaling specificity by mediating the assembly of multiprotein signaling complexes (gordon2013combiningdockingsite pages 15-17). The overall structure, as derived from crystallographic studies and reinforced by AlphaFold models, confirms that MAPK10 shares the highly conserved structural architecture of MAP kinases while exhibiting subtle isoform-specific variations that may contribute to its neuronal selectivity.\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulatory mechanisms governing MAPK10 activity are multi-layered and predominantly involve post-translational modifications. The primary regulatory event is the dual phosphorylation that occurs on the activation loop’s TPY motif; phosphorylation at both the threonine and the tyrosine residues by the upstream dual-specificity kinases MAP2K4 (MKK4) and MAP2K7 (MKK7) is indispensable for full catalytic activation of MAPK10 (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 1-3, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 1-2). This dual phosphorylation induces a significant conformational change that opens the substrate-binding cleft and aligns the catalytic machinery for efficient phosphoryl transfer. In addition to phosphorylation, MAPK10 is subject to regulation via protein–protein interactions. Scaffold proteins – notably members of the JNK-interacting protein (JIP) family – serve to tether MAPK10 with its activators and substrates, thus enhancing the specificity and efficiency of the signaling cascade (herdegen2005contextspecificinhibitionof pages 1-2, jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 10-11). Furthermore, non-degradative ubiquitination has been shown to modulate MAPK10 activity by altering its subcellular localization or interaction potential without triggering proteasomal degradation (ball2016nondegradativeubiquitinationof pages 40-41). Finally, the inactivation of MAPK10 is achieved via the action of specific phosphatases that dephosphorylate the activation loop, thereby returning the kinase to an inactive conformation in the absence of continued upstream signaling (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 2-3).\n\n7. Function  \nMAPK10 is predominantly expressed in neuronal tissues and plays a central role in mediating various aspects of neuronal physiology. It is critically involved in the regulation of neuronal proliferation, differentiation, migration, and programmed cell death (apoptosis) (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 1-3, coffey2014nuclearandcytosolic pages 1-2). As a key component of the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/JNK signaling pathway, MAPK10 is rapidly activated in response to extracellular stress signals such as pro-inflammatory cytokines or physical stress. Once activated, MAPK10 phosphorylates a suite of downstream substrates that collectively modulate cellular responses: its phosphorylation of transcription factors such as c-Jun and ATF2 is crucial for the regulation of AP-1–dependent gene expression programs implicated in stress responses and apoptosis (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 25-26, barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 1-3). In addition, MAPK10 phosphorylates JUND – a phosphorylation event that is specifically inhibited by the MEN1 protein – further fine-tuning the transcriptional output (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 4-6). Beyond transcription factors, MAPK10 targets neuronal-specific proteins; for example, its phosphorylation of STMN2, a microtubule regulator, plays a significant role in modulating cytoskeletal dynamics necessary for neurite outgrowth and neuronal process formation (ferrer2022dysregulatedproteinphosphorylation pages 30-33). Moreover, MAPK10 phosphorylates the amyloid precursor protein (APP), thereby influencing APP-mediated signaling pathways that are critical during neuronal differentiation. Its role extends to the regulation of circadian rhythms through phosphorylation of the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer, linking neuronal stress signaling to the control of daily physiological cycles (ferrer2022dysregulatedproteinphosphorylation pages 1-5, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 25-26). Collectively, these functions underscore MAPK10’s pivotal role in integrating extracellular stress signals with diverse intracellular responses that are fundamental to both neural development and the adaptive responses of neurons.\n\n8. Other Comments  \nMAPK10’s neuronal-restricted expression and its integral role in mediating stress-activated apoptotic signaling have made it a significant focus of therapeutic research. Several experimental inhibitors targeting the JNK family act by binding to the ATP-binding site or by disrupting critical docking interactions between MAPK10 and its substrates or scaffold proteins. Although most inhibitors developed to date are pan-JNK inhibitors, current research is increasingly directed toward refining isoform selectivity so as to preferentially inhibit MAPK10 while minimizing off-target effects on JNK1 and JNK2 (latham2022nonkinasetargetingof pages 1-3, latham2022nonkinasetargetingof pages 13-14). Furthermore, dysregulation of MAPK10-mediated phosphorylation has been implicated in a number of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease and acute neuronal injury, implicating overactivation of MAPK10 in pathological neuronal apoptosis (latham2022nonkinasetargetingof pages 5-6). In addition, structure-based virtual screening and in vitro assays have identified candidate molecules with neuroprotective potential that selectively inhibit MAPK10 activity, forming the basis for ongoing drug development efforts (rajan2020identificationandneuroprotective pages 11-12). Research has also highlighted the role of non-degradative ubiquitination in fine-tuning MAPK10 activity, suggesting that modulation of these post-translational modifications may provide alternative avenues to achieve therapeutic intervention while maintaining normal neuronal function (ball2016nondegradativeubiquitinationof pages 40-41).\n\n9.

Regulates protein synthesis through phosphorylation of EIF4B, RPS6 and EEF2K, and contributes to cell survival by repressing the pro-apoptotic function of BAD (PubMed:11500364, PubMed:12801526, PubMed:14673156, PubMed:15071500, PubMed:15341740, PubMed:16286006, PubMed:17052453, PubMed:17053147, PubMed:17936702, PubMed:18952604, PubMed:19085255, PubMed:19720745, PubMed:19935711, PubMed:19995915, PubMed:22017876, PubMed:23429703, PubMed:28178239). Under conditions of nutrient depletion, the inactive form associates with the EIF3 translation initiation complex (PubMed:16286006). Upon mitogenic stimulation, phosphorylation by the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) leads to dissociation from the EIF3 complex and activation (PubMed:16286006). The active form then phosphorylates and activates several substrates in the pre-initiation complex, including the EIF2B complex and the cap-binding complex component EIF4B (PubMed:16286006). Also controls translation initiation by phosphorylating a negative regulator of EIF4A, PDCD4, targeting it for ubiquitination and subsequent proteolysis (PubMed:17053147). Promotes initiation of the pioneer round of protein synthesis by phosphorylating POLDIP3/SKAR (PubMed:15341740). In response to IGF1, activates translation elongation by phosphorylating EEF2 kinase (EEF2K), which leads to its inhibition and thus activation of EEF2 (PubMed:11500364). Also plays a role in feedback regulation of mTORC2 by mTORC1 by phosphorylating MAPKAP1/SIN1, MTOR and RICTOR, resulting in the inhibition of mTORC2 and AKT1 signaling (PubMed:15899889, PubMed:19720745, PubMed:19935711, PubMed:19995915). Also involved in feedback regulation of mTORC1 and mTORC2 by phosphorylating DEPTOR (PubMed:22017876). Mediates cell survival by phosphorylating the pro-apoptotic protein BAD and suppressing its pro-apoptotic function (By similarity). Phosphorylates mitochondrial URI1 leading to dissociation of a URI1-PPP1CC complex (PubMed:17936702). The free mitochondrial PPP1CC can then dephosphorylate RPS6KB1 at Thr-412, which is proposed to be a negative feedback mechanism for the RPS6KB1 anti-apoptotic function (PubMed:17936702). Mediates TNF-alpha-induced insulin resistance by phosphorylating IRS1 at multiple serine residues, resulting in accelerated degradation of IRS1 (PubMed:18952604). In cells lacking functional TSC1-2 complex, constitutively phosphorylates and inhibits GSK3B (PubMed:17052453). May be involved in cytoskeletal rearrangement through binding to neurabin (By similarity). Phosphorylates and activates the pyrimidine biosynthesis enzyme CAD, downstream of MTOR (PubMed:23429703). Following activation by mTORC1, phosphorylates EPRS and thereby plays a key role in fatty acid uptake by adipocytes and also most probably in interferon-gamma-induced translation inhibition (PubMed:28178239)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695).

Phylogeny:**  \nRibosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1), commonly referred to as p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1, belongs to the AGC family of serine/threonine kinases and is a central component of the TOR signaling pathway. It is evolutionarily conserved across eukaryotes and can be traced to the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or earlier, with orthologs present in all mammalian species and broadly distributed among metazoans (bradley2019evolutionofprotein pages 1-2). RPS6KB1 is part of an ancestral core set of TOR pathway genes that also includes other AGC kinases such as phosphoinositide‐dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), protein kinase B (PKB/AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK), and serum‐ and glucocorticoid‐regulated kinase (SGK) (andrade2011eukaryoticproteinkinases pages 14-15). Gene duplication events in the common ancestor of animals and fungi led to the emergence of both S6 kinases and their closely related RSK kinases, with both groups being regulated by PDK1, while the activation of S6K1 is further controlled by the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) (briedis2008thedistributionand pages 26-31).\n\n**2. Reaction Catalyzed:**  \nRPS6KB1 catalyzes the phosphorylation process in which the gamma-phosphate group of ATP is transferred to specific serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins. The chemical reaction is represented as:  \nATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ (briedis2008thedistributionand pages 205-208).\n\n**3. Cofactor Requirements:**  \nThe catalytic activity of RPS6KB1 is dependent on Mg²⁺ ions. These divalent metal ions coordinate with the ATP molecule to facilitate the proper transfer of the phosphate group to the substrate (briedis2008thedistributionand pages 189-193).\n\n**4. Substrate Specificity:**  \nRPS6KB1 displays a substrate specificity characterized by a preference for protein substrates containing an RxRxxp[ST] consensus sequence. In this motif the phospho-acceptor residue can be either serine or threonine, and the residues at the –5 and –3 positions are most frequently arginine. This pattern of substrate recognition is well established for serine/threonine kinases within the human kinome based on studies such as the substrate specificity atlas for serine/threonine kinases (bradley2019evolutionofprotein pages 8-9, bdzhola2025coexpressionofthe pages 9-10).\n\n**5. Structure:**  \nRPS6KB1 is composed of a central kinase catalytic domain that is surrounded by intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. A key structural element is the conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif located near the N-terminus; in human S6K1 this motif, consisting of the FDIDL sequence at residues 5–9, is essential for binding to the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1, a step crucial for its phosphorylation and activation (ikuta2007crystalstructuresof pages 1-2, briedis2008thedistributionand pages 26-31). The kinase domain of RPS6KB1 includes well-defined regulatory features such as the activation loop (T-loop), which is phosphorylated by PDK1 at T229, and a hydrophobic motif that is phosphorylated at T389 by mTORC1, events that together are required for full enzymatic activity (pearce2010characterizationofpf4708671 pages 14-16). Additionally, RPS6KB1 contains a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain that distinguishes it from its paralog S6K2, which instead possesses a proline-rich region followed by a nuclear localization signal (bradley2019evolutionofprotein pages 25-25). Structural evidence obtained from experimental crystallography and supported by AlphaFold modeling confirms the presence of a catalytic core featuring a well-defined C-helix and hydrophobic spine, both of which are critical for substrate binding and catalysis (ikuta2007crystalstructuresof pages 1-2, pearce2010characterizationofpf4708671 pages 14-16).\n\n**6. Regulation:**  \nThe regulation of RPS6KB1 is predominantly achieved through a series of well-orchestrated phosphorylation events. Full activation of the kinase requires sequential phosphorylation steps. First, mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif (specifically at T389 in S6K1), creating a docking site for PDK1. Subsequently, PDK1 phosphorylates the activation loop (at T229 in S6K1) to relieve autoinhibition and initiate catalytic activity (ikuta2007crystalstructuresof pages 10-10, lai2015investigationsofthe pages 9-17). Under nutrient-deprived conditions, the inactive form of RPS6KB1 remains sequestered in a complex with the EIF3 translation initiation machinery; upon mitogenic stimulation and consequent mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation, RPS6KB1 dissociates from the EIF3 complex and becomes active (ahmed2019directimagingof pages 13-13, murphy2021theroleof pages 111-114). In addition to these primary regulatory phosphorylations, RPS6KB1 is involved in feedback regulation mechanisms within the mTOR signaling network. The kinase phosphorylates several mTOR complex components, including MAPKAP1/SIN1, MTOR, and RICTOR, which results in the inhibition of mTORC2 activity and downregulation of AKT1 signaling (bradley2019evolutionofprotein pages 18-19, cronin2023amechanisticapproach pages 27-34). Moreover, phosphorylation of DEPTOR by RPS6KB1 further contributes to the feedback regulation between mTORC1 and mTORC2 (bradley2019evolutionofprotein pages 21-22). RPS6KB1 also catalyzes phosphorylation of IRS1 on multiple serine residues, leading to its accelerated degradation and thereby mediating TNF-alpha-induced insulin resistance (murphy2021theroleof pages 15-21). Furthermore, phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAD by RPS6KB1 represses its activity to promote cell survival, and phosphorylation of mitochondrial URI1 leads to its dissociation from the PPP1CC complex; the liberated PPP1CC is then able to dephosphorylate RPS6KB1 at Thr-412, providing a negative feedback mechanism on its anti-apoptotic function (ahmed2019directimagingof pages 13-13). In cells that lack a functional TSC1/2 complex, RPS6KB1 is constitutively active, resulting in the phosphorylation and inhibition of GSK3B (murphy2021theroleof pages 15-21).\n\n**7. Function:**  \nRPS6KB1 functions as a pivotal downstream effector of mTORC1 signaling in response to growth factors and nutrient availability. The kinase plays a central role in promoting cell proliferation, growth, and cell cycle progression primarily by regulating protein synthesis. It achieves this by phosphorylating several key substrates involved in translation initiation and elongation. These substrates include EIF4B, which is a component of the cap-binding complex, ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6), a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (EEF2K), whose inhibition augments the activity of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (EEF2) for protein elongation (ahmed2019directimagingof pages 13-13, murphy2021theroleof pages 15-21). In addition to its role in protein synthesis, RPS6KB1 phosphorylates PDCD4, a negative regulator of EIF4A, thereby targeting PDCD4 for ubiquitination and proteolysis; it also phosphorylates POLDIP3/SKAR to promote the pioneer round of protein synthesis (ahmed2019directimagingof pages 13-13). Through phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAD, RPS6KB1 diminishes apoptotic signaling, which supports cell survival. Moreover, the kinase mediates feedback inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway by phosphorylating elements of the mTORC2 complex (MAPKAP1/SIN1, MTOR, RICTOR), resulting in the downregulation of AKT1 signaling (bradley2019evolutionofprotein pages 18-19, sridhar2022targetingrps6k1for pages 11-13). RPS6KB1 also targets IRS1, phosphorylating it on serine residues that trigger its degradation and contribute to insulin resistance. Beyond translational control and survival, RPS6KB1 influences metabolic pathways via phosphorylation of the pyrimidine biosynthesis enzyme CAD and by regulating fatty acid uptake through phosphorylation of EPRS (ahmed2019directimagingof pages 13-13).\n\n**8. Other Comments:**  \nSelective inhibition of RPS6KB1 has been a significant focus of drug discovery efforts owing to the kinase’s central role in cell growth, metabolism, and survival. One of the most notable inhibitors is PF-4708671, which has demonstrated approximately 20-fold selectivity for S6K1 over related kinases such as RSK and MSK; PF-4708671 inhibits S6K1 activity without affecting upstream phosphorylation events mediated by mTORC1 or PDK1 (pearce2010characterizationofpf4708671 pages 14-16, pearce2010characterizationofpf4708671 pages 16-17). TAS0612 is another compound that inhibits S6K along with other kinases including RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition effects in preclinical cancer models (pearce2010characterizationofpf4708671 pages 16-17). Dysregulation of RPS6KB1 activity is associated with pathological conditions, including various types of cancer, metabolic syndromes such as insulin resistance, and obesity (murphy2021theroleof pages 15-21). In addition, there is evidence linking RPS6KB1 function with cytoskeletal rearrangements via its potential interaction with neurabin, and its broad involvement in several cellular signaling cascades makes it a prime target for further therapeutic development. Several inhibitors such as LY2584702 have progressed into clinical trials, underscoring the ongoing interest in targeting RPS6KB1 for therapeutic benefit (sridhar2022targetingrps6k1for pages 11-13).\n\n**9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nRPS6KB2, encoding ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta‑2 (S6K2), is a member of the AGC kinase superfamily that emerged early in eukaryotic evolution. Orthologs of S6K2 are found throughout mammalian species, and its closest paralog is RPS6KB1 (S6K1). Both kinases share a common evolutionary origin with other TOR pathway effectors such as PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. The evolution of S6K enzymes is traced back to a gene duplication event in the common ancestor of animals and fungi, placing them within the evolutionary core of TOR signalling genes present in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) (Manning2002a, Manning2002b).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nRPS6KB2 catalyzes the phosphorylation reaction in which ATP and a protein substrate containing serine or threonine residues are converted to ADP and the phosphoprotein. The generalized reaction can be described as follows: ATP + [protein] – (L‑serine or L‑threonine) → ADP + [protein] – (L‑serine/threonine)‑phosphate + H⁺ (chrestensen2002characterizationofthe pages 3-5).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of S6K2 depends on the presence of divalent cations, with Mg²⁺ acting as the essential cofactor for ATP binding and phosphoryl transfer (chrestensen2002characterizationofthe pages 3-5).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nRPS6KB2 exhibits substrate specificity that is characteristic of serine/threonine kinases within the AGC family. It preferentially recognizes substrates bearing an RxRxxS/T motif. In particular, S6K2 phosphorylates the ribosomal protein S6 on specific serine residues in its C-terminal cluster; these phosphorylation events are crucial for promoting mRNA translation. Substrate specificity studies based on large‐scale analyses of the serine/threonine kinome have identified a consensus motif of RxRxxp[ST] that S6K2 uses, aligning with its primary role in phosphorylating ribosomal protein S6 (Johnson2023, chrestensen2002characterizationofthe pages 3-5).\n\n5. Structure  \nRPS6KB2 contains three major regions. The central kinase domain exhibits the conserved bi‐lobed structure typical of AGC kinases, including an activation loop (T-loop), a C-helix necessary for catalytic activity, and a hydrophobic spine that stabilizes its active conformation. Near the N-terminus, RPS6KB2 harbors a TOR signaling (TOS) motif that facilitates interaction with RAPTOR, an accessory component of the mTORC1 complex, and is essential for its mTOR-mediated phosphorylation and activation. In the C-terminal region, S6K2 is distinct from S6K1 as it possesses a proline-rich region followed immediately by a nuclear localization signal (NLS), rather than the PDZ-binding domain found in S6K1. This C-terminal arrangement is considered to be functionally important for directing subcellular localization and possibly for establishing interactions with specific substrates or regulatory proteins (huo2011investigationofthe pages 34-39, julich2008skaranovel pages 15-19, karlsson2014clinicalpotentialof pages 42-45). Structural studies and model predictions confirm that these domain features, including the TOS motif at the N-terminus and the proline-rich region with an embedded NLS in the C-terminus, underlie the unique regulation and substrate interactions of RPS6KB2 (magnuson2012regulationandfunction pages 2-3, thiriet2013cytoplasmicproteinserinethreonine pages 63-66).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe activation of S6K2 is tightly controlled by multi-step phosphorylation events primarily downstream of mTORC1 signaling. Full activation requires the phosphorylation of the hydrophobic motif at Thr388 by mTORC1 and phosphorylation at the activation loop (T-loop) at Thr228 by PDK1. These events relieve autoinhibition and stabilize the active conformation of the kinase (chrestensen2002characterizationofthe pages 5-7, magnuson2012regulationandfunction pages 6-7). In addition to these key phosphorylation events, RPS6KB2 undergoes various post-translational modifications including phosphorylation at additional serine or threonine residues, acetylation, ubiquitination, and arginine methylation in its C-terminal regulatory domain. For example, phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC) at specific sites in the C-terminal region can modulate the nuclear localization signal, leading to changes in subcellular distribution (khalil2024s6k2infocus pages 9-11, julich2008skaranovel pages 15-19). These modifications collectively determine its interaction with upstream activators such as mTOR and PDK1 and downstream substrates including ribosomal protein S6 (fonseca2016evolutionoftor pages 37-40, sridharan2020distinctrolesof pages 3-5).\n\n7. Function  \nAs a serine/threonine kinase, RPS6KB2 is responsible for phosphorylating ribosomal protein S6, a key component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, thereby regulating mRNA translation and protein synthesis. Its activity is modulated in response to growth factors and nutrients, functioning downstream of mTORC1 to promote cell proliferation, cell growth, and cell cycle progression. RPS6KB2 operates through an alternative pathway regulated, in part, by MEAK7 and is implicated in the fine-tuning of translational control in various cellular contexts (fonseca2014theeverevolvingrole pages 7-7, mostafa2012hormonalandnutrient pages 59-64). Moreover, S6K2 may contribute to feedback regulation within the mTOR signaling network and has been linked to cellular processes relevant in oncogenic contexts as well as metabolic homeostasis (sridharan2020distinctrolesof pages 1-3, khalil2024s6k2infocus pages 24-25). Experimental studies have demonstrated that deletion or knockdown of S6K2 results in major reductions in ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation, emphasizing its non-redundant role with S6K1 in the regulation of translational machinery (roux2018signalingpathwaysinvolved pages 11-13, ruvinsky2006ribosomalproteins6 pages 3-4).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral inhibitors targeting S6 kinases in general have been identified in preclinical studies. Inhibitors such as PF‑4708671 and LY2584702 can reduce the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 and downstream signaling events; however, these inhibitors tend to be more potent against S6K1 than S6K2 due to structural differences in their regulatory regions (karlsson2014clinicalpotentialof pages 49-52, majaeed2019s6kinasea pages 20-21). RPS6KB2 has been associated with cancer progression, and its differential expression and activity in various tumors have fueled interest in developing more selective therapeutic agents that target its unique C-terminal proline-rich region and nuclear localization features (tavares2015thes6kprotein pages 7-8, khalil2024s6k2infocus pages 7-9). RPS6KB2 is also under investigation as a potential mediator of chemoresistance and metabolic adaptation in cancer cells, indicating its relevance not only as a biomarker but also as a therapeutic target (lapenas2023ofthevulnerability pages 23-27, rebholz2006receptorassociationand pages 48-51).\n\n9.

Plays a role as an activator of the integrated stress response (ISR) required for adaptation to amino acid starvation (By similarity). EIF2S1/eIF-2-alpha phosphorylation in response to stress converts EIF2S1/eIF-2-alpha into a global protein synthesis inhibitor, leading to a global attenuation of cap-dependent translation, and thus to a reduced overall utilization of amino acids, while concomitantly initiating the preferential translation of ISR-specific mRNAs, such as the transcriptional activator ATF4, and hence allowing ATF4-mediated reprogramming of amino acid biosynthetic gene expression to alleviate nutrient depletion (PubMed:32610081). Binds uncharged tRNAs (By similarity). Required for the translational induction of protein kinase PRKCH following amino acid starvation (By similarity). Involved in cell cycle arrest by promoting cyclin D1 mRNA translation repression after the unfolded protein response pathway (UPR) activation or cell cycle inhibitor CDKN1A/p21 mRNA translation activation in response to amino acid deprivation (PubMed:26102367).

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \neIF-2-alpha kinase GCN2 (gene EIF2AK4, UniProt Q9P2K8) is a member of the eIF2α kinase family that is conserved broadly from yeast to mammals. Orthologs of GCN2 are found in fungi, plants, and animals, reflecting its central role as a nutrient and stress sensor in virtually all eukaryotes (rothenburg2016eif2α pages 1-4). In evolutionary terms, GCN2 represents one of the ancestral serine/threonine kinases implicated in translational regulation, and its domain organization – which includes the N-terminal RWD domain, a pseudokinase region, a catalytic kinase domain, a histidyl-tRNA synthetase-like domain, and a C-terminal ribosome-binding domain – appears in a similar arrangement in many species (rothenburg2016eif2α pages 4-8, tatara2024emergingroleof pages 1-2). Within the overall kinome, GCN2 is grouped with other stress‐responsive eIF2α kinases that share a common role of regulating the integrated stress response (ISR) by mediating phosphorylation of eIF2α, and its evolutionary relationship with these kinases has been well established through comparative genomic analyses that trace its origin to an ancient common ancestor (jochmann2014identificationofribosomal pages 19-24, bruggenthies2021geneticandchemical pages 25-30).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nGCN2 catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α). The reaction can be summarized as follows: ATP + eIF2α → ADP + eIF2α phosphorylated on a specific serine residue (Ser51 in mammals) + H⁺ (carlson2023activationofgcn2 pages 8-15, donnelly2013theeif2αkinases pages 5-6). This phosphorylation event converts eIF2α into an inhibitor of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B, thereby reducing the overall availability of eIF2-GTP required for cap-dependent translation initiation (altintas2024generalcontrolnonderepressible pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of GCN2 is dependent on the presence of Mg²⁺ ions that serve as essential cofactors for ATP binding and catalysis. Mg²⁺ coordinates with ATP in the catalytic site, thereby facilitating the transfer of the phosphate group to the serine residue on eIF2α (carlson2023activationofgcn2 pages 96-102).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nGCN2 displays high substrate specificity for the alpha subunit of eIF2, phosphorylating it predominantly on serine 51 in mammalian cells. As a serine/threonine kinase, GCN2 relies on a substrate recognition motif that is dictated by the structural context of eIF2α. Experimental studies have demonstrated that the phosphorylation of eIF2α by GCN2 is tightly associated with its ability to recognize a specific amino acid environment surrounding the target serine residue (baird2014noveltargetsof pages 20-23, donnelly2013theeif2αkinases pages 5-6). Although a detailed consensus motif such as those reported for other families of serine/threonine kinases (for example, the RxRxxp[ST] motif described for many kinases) has not been explicitly defined for GCN2 itself in the available literature, its substrate specificity is well evidenced by the consistent and selective phosphorylation event on eIF2α during stress responses (carlson2023activationofgcn2 pages 102-106).\n\n5. Structure  \nGCN2 is organized into several functional domains that contribute to both its catalytic activity and regulatory responsiveness. The N-terminal region contains an RWD domain that mediates protein–protein interactions, most notably with the activator protein GCN1. Adjacent to this, a pseudokinase domain is present; although it lacks catalytic activity, it plays a regulatory role by modulating the conformation of the catalytic domain (altintas2024generalcontrolnonderepressible pages 7-8, bruggenthies2021geneticandchemical pages 9-11). The kinase domain itself contains the conserved bilobal structure typical of protein kinases, with an N-terminal lobe responsible for ATP binding – characterized by the glycine-rich loop and an invariant lysine – and a C-terminal lobe that contributes to substrate recognition and catalysis. Key catalytic residues such as those in the HRD and DFG motifs, as well as an activation loop subject to autophosphorylation (e.g., threonine residues such as T899 in humans), are essential for full kinase activity (carlson2023activationofgcn2 pages 26-31, lehman2015theroleof pages 91-94). Downstream of the catalytic region, GCN2 possesses a histidyl-tRNA synthetase-like (HisRS) domain; despite its name, this domain does not carry out aminoacylation, but rather it functions as a sensor that binds uncharged tRNAs accumulating during amino acid deprivation (altintas2024generalcontrolnonderepressible pages 1-2, ishimura2016activationofgcn2 pages 1-2). Finally, a C-terminal domain (CTD) facilitates ribosome binding and dimerization, which are necessary for effective signal transduction and full activation of the kinase (altintas2024generalcontrolnonderepressible pages 7-8, carlson2023activationofgcn2 pages 31-35).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulatory mechanisms of GCN2 are multifaceted and center on its response to cellular stress signals. Central to its regulation is the binding of deacylated (uncharged) tRNAs to the HisRS-like domain, a process that relieves autoinhibition imposed by intra-domain interactions and induces conformational changes that promote kinase dimerization and subsequent autophosphorylation within the activation loop (altintas2024generalcontrolnonderepressible pages 1-2, ishimura2016activationofgcn2 pages 1-2). In addition, the interaction with GCN1 facilitates the localization of GCN2 to stalled ribosomes, thereby amplifying its activation in response to amino acid starvation (jochmann2014identificationofribosomal pages 19-24, bruggenthies2021geneticandchemical pages 34-36). Autophosphorylation events, particularly on residues within the activation loop (for example, T899), are critical for transitioning GCN2 to an active state (carlson2023activationofgcn2 pages 111-116). Conversely, phosphorylation by other kinases, such as mTOR in conditions of hyperactivation, has been shown to modulate GCN2 activity; for instance, phosphorylation on serine 230 can influence its binding properties and overall kinase activity, and this modification is sensitive to Torin1 inhibition (darawshi2024phosphorylationofgcn2 pages 7-7). Regulatory proteins such as IMPACT and Yih1 also interact with GCN2 or its activator complex (GCN1/GCN20) to negatively regulate its activity, ensuring that under normal nutrient conditions the ISR is kept at bay (altintas2024generalcontrolnonderepressible pages 6-7, tatara2024emergingroleof pages 17-18). Furthermore, interactions with ribosomal components, including the ribosomal P-stalk, have been implicated in enhancing GCN2 activation in response to ribosome stalling, linking translation elongation status to initiation control (ishimura2016activationofgcn2 pages 2-3, tatara2024emergingroleof pages 11-12).\n\n7. Function  \nGCN2 functions as a critical sensor of metabolic stress, acting as a master regulator of the integrated stress response (ISR). Upon sensing amino acid deprivation through uncharged tRNA binding, GCN2 phosphorylates eIF2α, leading to an overall reduction in cap-dependent protein synthesis. This global attenuation of translation conserves cellular amino acids during nutrient scarcity and, at the same time, selectively promotes the translation of specific mRNAs, such as that encoding the transcription factor ATF4. The ATF4-dependent transcriptional programme leads to the induction of genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis, transport, redox homeostasis, and other adaptive processes that help cells cope with nutrient stress (altintas2024generalcontrolnonderepressible pages 1-2, altintas2024generalcontrolnonderepressible pages 8-8). Beyond its canonical role in amino acid sensing, GCN2 is implicated in multiple cellular pathways: it participates in cell cycle arrest by repressing cyclin D1 mRNA translation or by promoting the translation of cell cycle inhibitors like p21 in response to unfolded protein stress (altintas2024generalcontrolnonderepressible pages 6-7, lehman2015theroleof pages 94-97). In neurons, GCN2 has been associated with synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation, with its proper function being necessary for long-term memory formation and neurite outgrowth regulation (altintas2024generalcontrolnonderepressible pages 6-6, goodman2019therolesof pages 101-105). Its role in the innate antiviral response has also been documented; during alphavirus infection, for example, GCN2 activation impairs the translation of viral proteins by rapidly phosphorylating eIF2α, thus contributing to the host defense mechanism (altintas2024generalcontrolnonderepressible pages 8-8, goodman2019therolesofa pages 101-105). These diverse functions underscore GCN2’s key position in connecting nutrient availability and other stress signals to translational control and cellular adaptation (bruggenthies2021geneticandchemical pages 25-30, tatara2024emergingroleof pages 11-12).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral small molecule inhibitors and pharmacological agents have been reported to modulate GCN2 activity, most notably through ATP-competitive binding mechanisms; compounds such as GCN2iB, dabrafenib, and other type I½ inhibitors have been shown to interact with the ATP pocket of GCN2 and can even paradoxically activate the kinase at low concentrations (carlson2023activationofgcn2 pages 15-21, carlson2023activationofgcn2 pages 92-96). Moreover, disease associations for GCN2 are significant; mutations in EIF2AK4 are linked to pulmonary veno-occlusive disease, while dysregulation of GCN2 activity has been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, and metabolic syndromes (altintas2024generalcontrolnonderepressible pages 7-8, goodman2019therolesof pages 101-105). In cancer, aberrant activation of the ISR via GCN2 can support tumor cell survival under nutrient stress, and inhibitors of GCN2 are being explored as potential therapeutic agents in this context (carlson2023activationofgcn2 pages 111-116, zhao2023multiplerolesof pages 18-19). In addition, GCN2 has been implicated in the antiviral response and in modulating immune cell functions, whereby its activation contributes to altered cytokine profiles and immune regulation under conditions of amino acid starvation (zhao2023multiplerolesof pages 9-11, tatara2024emergingroleof pages 17-18). These aspects make GCN2 an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in diseases involving metabolic and translational dysregulation.\n\n9.

Recognizes the substrate consensus sequence [ST]-Q (PubMed:10550055, PubMed:10839545, PubMed:10910365, PubMed:12556884, PubMed:14871926, PubMed:15448695, PubMed:15456891, PubMed:15916964, PubMed:17923702, PubMed:24534091, PubMed:9733514). Phosphorylates 'Ser-139' of histone variant H2AX at double strand breaks (DSBs), thereby regulating DNA damage response mechanism (By similarity). Also plays a role in pre-B cell allelic exclusion, a process leading to expression of a single immunoglobulin heavy chain allele to enforce clonality and monospecific recognition by the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) expressed on individual B-lymphocytes. After the introduction of DNA breaks by the RAG complex on one immunoglobulin allele, acts by mediating a repositioning of the second allele to pericentromeric heterochromatin, preventing accessibility to the RAG complex and recombination of the second allele. Also involved in signal transduction and cell cycle control. May function as a tumor suppressor. Necessary for activation of ABL1 and SAPK. Phosphorylates DYRK2, CHEK2, p53/TP53, FBXW7, FANCD2, NFKBIA, BRCA1, CREBBP/CBP, RBBP8/CTIP, MRE11, nibrin (NBN), RAD50, RAD17, PELI1, TERF1, UFL1, RAD9, UBQLN4 and DCLRE1C (PubMed:10550055, PubMed:10766245, PubMed:10802669, PubMed:10839545, PubMed:10910365, PubMed:10973490, PubMed:11375976, PubMed:12086603, PubMed:15456891, PubMed:19965871, PubMed:21757780, PubMed:24534091, PubMed:26240375, PubMed:26774286, PubMed:30612738, PubMed:30886146, PubMed:30952868, PubMed:38128537, PubMed:9733515, PubMed:9843217). May play a role in vesicle and/or protein transport. Could play a role in T-cell development, gonad and neurological function. Plays a role in replication-dependent histone mRNA degradation. Binds DNA ends. Phosphorylation of DYRK2 in nucleus in response to genotoxic stress prevents its MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome degradation (PubMed:19965871). Phosphorylates ATF2 which stimulates its function in DNA damage response (PubMed:15916964). Phosphorylates ERCC6 which is essential for its chromatin remodeling activity at DNA double-strand breaks (PubMed:29203878). Phosphorylates TTC5/STRAP at 'Ser-203' in the cytoplasm in response to DNA damage, which promotes TTC5/STRAP nuclear localization (PubMed:15448695). Also involved in pexophagy by mediating phosphorylation of PEX5: translocated to peroxisomes in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS), and catalyzes phosphorylation of PEX5, promoting PEX5 ubiquitination and induction of pexophagy (PubMed:26344566)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nSerine‐protein kinase ATM is a serine/threonine kinase that belongs to the phosphatidylinositol 3‐kinase-related kinase (PIKK) family, an atypical but evolutionarily highly conserved branch of the human kinome. Orthologs of ATM have been identified in a myriad of eukaryotic organisms, including mammals, vertebrates, yeast, and various invertebrates, indicating that its evolutionary origin can be traced back to early eukaryotic ancestors. Phylogenetic analyses based on the protein kinase complement of the human genome reveal that ATM clusters with other long, multidomain kinases such as ATR and DNA-PKcs, all of which participate in DNA damage response pathways. These kinases share not only similar domain architectures but also overlapping functional roles in genome surveillance and the maintenance of genomic integrity, distinguishing them from canonical kinase families like AGC, CMGC, and STE (hunter2015theeukaryoticprotein pages 1-3, moret2020aresourcefor pages 1-4, oruganty2016identificationandclassification pages 12-13).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nThe chemical reaction catalyzed by ATM is the phosphorylation of serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins. In this reaction, the gamma-phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is transferred to the hydroxyl group of a serine or threonine residue, yielding adenosine diphosphate (ADP), a phosphorylated protein substrate, and a proton (H⁺). This reaction is summarized as:  \nATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(phospho-L-serine/threonine) + H⁺  \nThis catalytic reaction is fundamental to ATM’s role as a signal transducer in the DNA damage response, converting the detection of double-strand breaks into a cascade of phosphorylation events that ultimately regulate cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and DNA repair processes (anti2009nonspecificserinethreonineprotein pages 1-7).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nATM kinase activity is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions to coordinate ATP binding and catalysis. In particular, magnesium (Mg²⁺) is the critical cofactor required for ATM’s enzymatic activity. Mg²⁺ ions associate with ATP in the kinase active site to properly orient the gamma-phosphate for transfer and to stabilize the transition state, a requirement that is shared among serine/threonine kinases. Without sufficient levels of Mg²⁺, the catalytic efficiency of ATM would be severely compromised, thereby hindering the propagation of DNA damage signals (moret2020aresourcefor pages 1-4).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nATM displays a distinct substrate specificity that centers on recognizing a short consensus motif consisting of either serine or threonine immediately followed by glutamine, commonly denoted as [S/T]-Q. This minimal recognition sequence is critical for ATM’s ability to phosphorylate targets that are involved in the response to DNA double-strand breaks. Large-scale substrate profiling experiments of the human serine/threonine kinome have confirmed that ATM preferentially modifies substrates containing this [S/T]-Q motif. An exemplary substrate of ATM is the histone variant H2AX, which is phosphorylated on Ser-139 to form γH2AX; this phosphorylation event is a hallmark of the DNA damage response and is instrumental for recruiting repair complexes to the site of damage. Although there is distinct substrate diversity among kinases, the preference of ATM for substrates presenting the [S/T]-Q consensus aligns with its central role in mediating cellular responses to genotoxic stress (johnson2023anatlasof pages 3-4, johnson2023anatlasof pages 6-7, yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 1-2).\n\n5. Structure  \nATM is an exceptionally large protein kinase with an approximate molecular weight of 350 kilodaltons. Its structure is highly complex and multidomain, featuring several distinct regions that endow it with its regulatory and catalytic functions. The N-terminal portion of ATM is characterized by an abundance of HEAT repeats—tandemly arranged α-helical motifs that serve as flexible scaffolds for mediating protein–protein interactions and the assembly of high-order complexes. These HEAT repeats are thought to play roles in both autoinhibition and the recruitment of regulatory partners to ATM. Centrally located within ATM is the catalytic kinase domain, which is highly characteristic of the PIKK family. This domain contains key structural features necessary for enzymatic activity, including the activation loop, a catalytic loop harboring essential residues that coordinate ATP binding, a hydrophobic spine that helps stabilize the active conformation, and a regulatory C-helix that contributes to conformational control. Flanking the kinase domain are the FAT domain (FRAP–ATM–TRRAP) positioned near the N-terminal side of the kinase domain, and the FATC domain, located at the extreme C-terminus. Both the FAT and FATC domains contribute to the structural stability and proper folding of the kinase domain and play crucial roles in modulating ATM’s catalytic activity. Partial structural data derived from cryo-electron microscopy and predictive models from AlphaFold provide further evidence of ATM’s flexible yet ordered architecture, supporting its function as a sensor of DNA damage and orchestrator of downstream signaling events (modi2019astructurallyvalidatedmultiple pages 13-14, east2024quantitativeproteomicmass pages 13-15, maeda2025detectingproteinhigherorder pages 27-28).\n\n6. Regulation  \nATM is subject to intricate regulatory mechanisms that ensure its activation is precisely coupled to the presence of DNA damage. In the absence of genotoxic stress, ATM predominantly exists in an inactive state, typically forming dimers or higher-order oligomers. Upon the induction of double-strand breaks in DNA, ATM becomes activated through a series of tightly controlled post-translational modifications. Among these modifications, autophosphorylation at key residues—most notably at Ser-1981—is critically important; this autophosphorylation event triggers the dissociation of ATM dimers into active monomers, which are then competent to phosphorylate various downstream targets. In addition to autophosphorylation, ATM regulation is further modulated by ubiquitination, which influences its protein stability and turnover, and by interactions with the MRN complex (comprising MRE11, RAD50, and NBS1) that recruits ATM to sites of DNA damage. The combined effect of these modifications—phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and regulated protein–protein interactions—ensures that ATM’s kinase activity is initiated only when appropriate signals, such as double-strand breaks or oxidative stress, are present (mullerdott2025fromactivityinference pages 145-146, somale2020activationofrsk pages 12-13, o’boyle2025anatlasof pages 31-35).\n\n7. Function  \nATM serves as a master regulator of the cellular response to DNA damage. Its primary function is to act as a DNA damage sensor that, upon detecting double-strand breaks (DSBs) and other forms of genotoxic stress such as exposure to ionizing radiation and ultraviolet A light, activates a cascade of phosphorylation events. One of its most well-characterized roles is the phosphorylation of the histone variant H2AX on Ser-139, generating γH2AX, which serves as a recruitment signal for DNA repair machinery and is essential for proper execution of the DNA damage response. In addition, ATM phosphorylates and thereby modulates the activity of several critical proteins involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, including TP53 (p53), CHEK2, BRCA1, and FANCD2. These phosphorylation events facilitate cell cycle arrest, promote efficient DNA repair, and, when damage is excessive, trigger programmed cell death. Beyond its canonical role in DNA repair, ATM is also implicated in non–DNA repair processes such as pre-B cell allelic exclusion; by repositioning one immunoglobulin heavy chain allele to pericentromeric heterochromatin, ATM helps ensure that individual B lymphocytes express a single allele, thereby enforcing receptor clonality. Moreover, ATM has been associated with functions that extend to vesicle and protein transport, T-cell development, gonadal and neurological functions, and the degradation of replication-dependent histone mRNA. Additional targets of ATM include substrates such as DYRK2, whose phosphorylation by ATM prevents its MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent degradation, as well as ATF2 and ERCC6, which are important for augmenting the DNA damage response and chromatin remodeling. ATM’s multifaceted role in cellular signaling underscores its critical function as a tumor suppressor, with defects in ATM activity leading to genomic instability and contributing to disease states such as ataxia telangiectasia (anti2009nonspecificserinethreonineprotein pages 1-7, johnson2023anatlasof pages 9-10, murray2019identifyingnoveltherapeutic pages 465-467).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nATM is not only pivotal for the maintenance of genome stability but also has notable clinical implications. Mutations in the ATM gene cause ataxia telangiectasia, a severe autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive neurodegeneration, immunodeficiency, radiosensitivity, and an increased predisposition to cancer. Given its central role in the DNA damage response, ATM is considered a tumor suppressor, and its loss or dysfunction is associated with genomic instability. In recent years, several small molecule inhibitors targeting ATM’s kinase activity—such as KU-55933, KU-60019, and AZD1390—have been developed with the aim of sensitizing cancer cells to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy. These compounds are being evaluated in various preclinical and clinical settings to exploit the synthetic lethal relationships that exist in tumors with defective DNA repair pathways. In addition to pharmacological inhibition, research continues to explore ATM’s involvement in diverse cellular processes, including vesicle and protein transport, pexophagy (mediated by phosphorylation of PEX5 in response to reactive oxygen species), and the regulation of immunoglobulin gene rearrangements in B cells. ATM’s broad substrate network and its regulatory complexity, as illustrated by its interactions with proteins such as DYRK2, CHEK2, and MRE11, reflect its expansive role in cell signaling and underscore its importance as a target for therapeutic intervention in cancers and other diseases related to DNA repair deficiencies (mullerdott2025fromactivityinference pages 48-52, murray2019identifyingnoveltherapeutic pages 465-467, oruganty2016identificationandclassification pages 12-13).\n\n9.

MTOR directly or indirectly regulates the phosphorylation of at least 800 proteins (PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:17517883, PubMed:18372248, PubMed:18497260, PubMed:18925875, PubMed:20516213, PubMed:21576368, PubMed:21659604, PubMed:23429704, PubMed:29236692, PubMed:37751742). Functions as part of 2 structurally and functionally distinct signaling complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2 (mTOR complex 1 and 2) (PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:18497260, PubMed:18925875, PubMed:20516213, PubMed:21576368, PubMed:21659604, PubMed:23429704, PubMed:29424687, PubMed:29567957, PubMed:35926713). In response to nutrients, growth factors or amino acids, mTORC1 is recruited to the lysosome membrane and promotes protein, lipid and nucleotide synthesis by phosphorylating key regulators of mRNA translation and ribosome synthesis (PubMed:12087098, PubMed:12150925, PubMed:12150926, PubMed:12231510, PubMed:12718876, PubMed:14651849, PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:15545625, PubMed:15718470, PubMed:18497260, PubMed:18762023, PubMed:18925875, PubMed:20516213, PubMed:20537536, PubMed:21659604, PubMed:23429703, PubMed:23429704, PubMed:25799227, PubMed:26018084, PubMed:29150432, PubMed:29236692, PubMed:31112131, PubMed:34519269). This includes phosphorylation of EIF4EBP1 and release of its inhibition toward the elongation initiation factor 4E (eiF4E) (PubMed:24403073, PubMed:29236692). Moreover, phosphorylates and activates RPS6KB1 and RPS6KB2 that promote protein synthesis by modulating the activity of their downstream targets including ribosomal protein S6, eukaryotic translation initiation factor EIF4B, and the inhibitor of translation initiation PDCD4 (PubMed:12087098, PubMed:12150925, PubMed:18925875, PubMed:29150432, PubMed:29236692). Stimulates the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, both by acute regulation through RPS6KB1-mediated phosphorylation of the biosynthetic enzyme CAD, and delayed regulation, through transcriptional enhancement of the pentose phosphate pathway which produces 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP), an allosteric activator of CAD at a later step in synthesis, this function is dependent on the mTORC1 complex (PubMed:23429703, PubMed:23429704). Regulates ribosome synthesis by activating RNA polymerase III-dependent transcription through phosphorylation and inhibition of MAF1 an RNA polymerase III-repressor (PubMed:20516213). Activates dormant ribosomes by mediating phosphorylation of SERBP1, leading to SERBP1 inactivation and reactivation of translation (PubMed:36691768). In parallel to protein synthesis, also regulates lipid synthesis through SREBF1/SREBP1 and LPIN1 (PubMed:23426360). To maintain energy homeostasis mTORC1 may also regulate mitochondrial biogenesis through regulation of PPARGC1A (By similarity). In the same time, mTORC1 inhibits catabolic pathways: negatively regulates autophagy through phosphorylation of ULK1 (PubMed:32561715). Under nutrient sufficiency, phosphorylates ULK1 at 'Ser-758', disrupting the interaction with AMPK and preventing activation of ULK1 (PubMed:32561715). Also prevents autophagy through phosphorylation of the autophagy inhibitor DAP (PubMed:20537536). Also prevents autophagy by phosphorylating RUBCNL/Pacer under nutrient-rich conditions (PubMed:30704899). Prevents autophagy by mediating phosphorylation of AMBRA1, thereby inhibiting AMBRA1 ability to mediate ubiquitination of ULK1 and interaction between AMBRA1 and PPP2CA (PubMed:23524951, PubMed:25438055). mTORC1 exerts a feedback control on upstream growth factor signaling that includes phosphorylation and activation of GRB10 a INSR-dependent signaling suppressor (PubMed:21659604). Among other potential targets mTORC1 may phosphorylate CLIP1 and regulate microtubules (PubMed:12231510). The mTORC1 complex is inhibited in response to starvation and amino acid depletion (PubMed:12150925, PubMed:12150926, PubMed:24403073, PubMed:31695197). The non-canonical mTORC1 complex, which acts independently of RHEB, specifically mediates phosphorylation of MiT/TFE factors MITF, TFEB and TFE3 in the presence of nutrients, promoting their cytosolic retention and inactivation (PubMed:22343943, PubMed:22576015, PubMed:22692423, PubMed:24448649, PubMed:32612235, PubMed:36608670, PubMed:36697823). Upon starvation or lysosomal stress, inhibition of mTORC1 induces dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of TFEB and TFE3, promoting their transcription factor activity (PubMed:22343943, PubMed:22576015, PubMed:22692423, PubMed:24448649, PubMed:32612235, PubMed:36608670). The mTORC1 complex regulates pyroptosis in macrophages by promoting GSDMD oligomerization (PubMed:34289345). MTOR phosphorylates RPTOR which in turn inhibits mTORC1 (By similarity). As part of the mTORC2 complex, MTOR transduces signals from growth factors to pathways involved in proliferation, cytoskeletal organization, lipogenesis and anabolic output (PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:24670654, PubMed:29424687, PubMed:29567957, PubMed:35926713). In response to growth factors, mTORC2 phosphorylates and activates AGC protein kinase family members, including AKT (AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3), PKC (PRKCA, PRKCB and PRKCE) and SGK1 (PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:21376236, PubMed:24670654, PubMed:29424687, PubMed:29567957, PubMed:35926713). In contrast to mTORC1, mTORC2 is nutrient-insensitive (PubMed:15467718). mTORC2 plays a critical role in AKT1 activation by mediating phosphorylation of different sites depending on the context, such as 'Thr-450', 'Ser-473', 'Ser-477' or 'Thr-479', facilitating the phosphorylation of the activation loop of AKT1 on 'Thr-308' by PDPK1/PDK1 which is a prerequisite for full activation (PubMed:15718470, PubMed:21376236, PubMed:24670654, PubMed:29424687, PubMed:29567957). mTORC2 also regulates the phosphorylation of SGK1 at 'Ser-422' (PubMed:18925875). mTORC2 may regulate the actin cytoskeleton, through phosphorylation of PRKCA, PXN and activation of the Rho-type guanine nucleotide exchange factors RHOA and RAC1A or RAC1B (PubMed:15268862). The mTORC2 complex also phosphorylates various proteins involved in insulin signaling, such as FBXW8 and IGF2BP1 (By similarity). May also regulate insulin signaling by acting as a tyrosine protein kinase that catalyzes phosphorylation of IGF1R and INSR; additional evidence are however required to confirm this result in vivo (PubMed:26584640). Regulates osteoclastogenesis by adjusting the expression of CEBPB isoforms (By similarity). Plays an important regulatory role in the circadian clock function; regulates period length and rhythm amplitude of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and liver clocks (By similarity)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nSerine/threonine‐protein kinase mTOR is a highly conserved member of the phosphatidylinositol 3‐kinase‐related kinase (PIKK) family that can be traced across eukaryotes. In yeast, orthologs exist as TOR1 and TOR2, which fulfill overlapping but distinct roles in regulating growth, ribosome biogenesis, and cytoskeletal organization (inoki2005signalingbytarget pages 1-1). In mammals, mTOR is encoded by a single gene yet retains the core functions inherited from the common ancestor of eukaryotes, including integration of nutrient, growth factor, and energy signals. mTOR belongs to an evolutionary core set of proteins that includes other key regulators such as Rheb, TSC1/TSC2, and components of the TOR complex (inoki2005signalingbytarget pages 1-3, inokiUnknownyearsignalingbytarget pages 3-4). Its phylogenetic grouping in the human kinome places it among the atypical serine/threonine kinases with a catalytic structure more similar to lipid kinases, although mTOR itself lacks lipid kinase activity. This subgroup derives from the early-branching evolutionary events that provided the regulatory backbone for cell growth and metabolism in all eukaryotes (inoki2005signalingbytarget pages 1-1).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nmTOR catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation reaction in which the γ-phosphate of ATP is transferred to specific serine or threonine residues located on substrate proteins. The chemical reaction can be represented as follows: ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(phospho-L-serine or phospho-L-threonine) + H⁺. This reaction underpins the kinase’s ability to modulate the activity, localization, and interaction of multiple downstream targets (inoki2005signalingbytarget pages 5-6).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nFor its catalytic activity, mTOR requires divalent metal ions that facilitate the binding of ATP and the subsequent phosphoryl transfer reaction. Consistent with other serine/threonine kinases, mTOR’s kinase activity is dependent on the presence of Mg²⁺ ions, and in some instances, Mn²⁺ may also serve as a cofactor. These metal ions coordinate the ATP substrate within the catalytic pocket, enabling the efficient transfer of the phosphate group to substrate proteins (inoki2005signalingbytarget pages 10-11, sabbah2011dualinhibitorsof pages 15-16).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nmTOR displays substrate specificity that is governed by the linear amino acid context flanking the phosphorylated serine/threonine residue. Recent large-scale studies have refined the consensus phosphorylation motifs recognized by mTOR complexes. Specifically, analysis from Johnson et al. (2023) provides evidence that mTOR substrates tend to possess particular amino acid preferences around the phospho-acceptor site; these preferences include basophilic determinants that likely involve positively charged residues proximal to the target site (johnson2023anatlasof pages 3-4, johnson2023anatlasof pages 12-18). In mTORC1, substrates such as 4E-BP1 and RPS6KB1 (p70 S6 kinase) exhibit motifs that promote interaction with mTOR through docking sequences like the TOR signaling (TOS) motif, characterized by a short, conserved stretch of hydrophobic residues necessary for recruitment by adaptor proteins like Raptor (inoki2005signalingbytarget pages 5-6, inoki2005signalingbytarget pages 4-5). Although mTOR itself phosphorylates a broad array of downstream proteins—over 800 have been documented—the precise consensus motif may be refined in future studies; current evidence underscores the importance of specific flanking residues in determining mTOR-mediated phosphorylation events (johnson2023anatlasof pages 4-5).\n\n5. Structure  \nmTOR is a very large protein with an elaborate multidomain organization that underlies both its catalytic and regulatory functions. The N-terminal region is characterized by multiple HEAT (Huntingtin, EF3, PP2A, TOR1) repeats that mediate extensive protein–protein interactions with regulatory adaptors and substrates. Following the HEAT repeats is the FAT (FRAP, ATM, TRRAP) domain, which is involved in the overall structural integrity and proper folding of the protein. Adjacent to this, mTOR contains the FRB (FKBP12-rapamycin binding) domain, whose binding to the FKBP12–rapamycin complex is responsible for the allosteric inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin. The central region houses the kinase domain, which is responsible for the ATP-dependent phosphorylation reaction; this catalytic core shows structural homology to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases and contains key features such as the activation loop and a hydrophobic spine that is critical for catalytic competence (inoki2005signalingbytarget pages 3-4, inoki2005signalingbytarget pages 18-19). Finally, mTOR possesses a C-terminal FATC domain which is essential for maintaining the stability and activity of the kinase. High-resolution structural studies using crystallographic and cryo-electron microscopy approaches have begun to reveal conformational states of mTOR and its assemblies in mTORC1 and mTORC2, further highlighting the dynamic regulation of kinase activity by structural rearrangements and complex formation (inoki2005signalingbytarget pages 16-16, inokiUnknownyearsignalingbytarget pages 17-18).\n\n6. Regulation  \nmTOR is subject to a complex network of regulatory mechanisms that finely tune its kinase activity in response to a variety of intracellular and extracellular signals. Key regulatory inputs include post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation events at multiple sites on mTOR and its associated regulatory proteins. For instance, phosphorylation by upstream kinases such as Akt and RSK is known to modulate mTOR activity, while feedback loops via downstream effectors like S6K can inhibit or activate upstream signaling components in a tightly controlled manner (inoki2005signalingbytarget pages 16-17, inokiUnknownyearsignalingbytarget pages 17-18). In addition to phosphorylation, mTOR is regulated through its assembly into two distinct multiprotein complexes—mTORC1 and mTORC2—with different regulatory subunits. The mTORC1 complex, which includes Raptor and mLst8, is acutely sensitive to nutrient levels, growth factors, and cellular energy status. Under conditions of nutrient sufficiency or growth factor stimulation, Rheb (a farnesylated small GTPase) becomes active and positively regulates mTORC1. Conversely, the TSC1/TSC2 complex, which functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rheb, acts as a major negative regulator when cellular conditions indicate stress or energy depletion (inoki2005signalingbytarget pages 15-16, inokiUnknownyearsignalingbytarget pages 15-16). In contrast, mTORC2 is primarily regulated by growth factor signaling and is largely insensitive to nutrient levels, thereby modulating cytoskeletal organization and survival pathways. In addition, mTOR regulation involves ubiquitination events and interactions with other regulatory proteins such as Rictor in mTORC2, and regulatory feedback via GRB10 that modulate insulin receptor signaling (inoki2005signalingbytarget pages 21-22). These layers of regulation ensure that mTOR integrates signals from multiple pathways—such as PI3K/Akt, AMPK, and LKB1—to maintain cellular homeostasis (inoki2005signalingbytarget pages 16-17).\n\n7. Function  \nmTOR plays a central role in controlling cell growth, metabolism, and survival by coordinating processes that involve protein, lipid, and nucleotide synthesis. It is a master regulator of cellular anabolic processes that are critical for cell proliferation and growth. Under nutrient-rich conditions, mTORC1 is recruited to the lysosomal membrane where Rheb activates its kinase activity, leading to phosphorylation of pivotal downstream substrates such as 4E-BP1 and S6K1. Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 results in its dissociation from the translation initiation factor eIF4E, thereby facilitating cap-dependent translation initiation. Concurrently, mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1 and S6K2 stimulates the translation of mRNAs that encode components of the translational machinery, including proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis and elongation (inoki2005signalingbytarget pages 7-8, inoki2005signalingbytarget pages 8-9). In addition to protein synthesis, mTORC1 regulates lipid synthesis through its effects on sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) and influences nucleotide synthesis via both acute phosphorylation events (e.g., CAD phosphorylation mediated through RPS6KB1) and transcriptional control of the pentose phosphate pathway (inoki2005signalingbytarget pages 21-22). Moreover, mTOR plays a role in repressing autophagy by phosphorylating key autophagy regulators such as ULK1. This suppression of autophagy is a critical component of mTOR’s role in ensuring that anabolic processes proceed only under conditions of adequate nutrient availability (inoki2005signalingbytarget pages 21-22, inokiUnknownyearsignalingbytarget pages 17-18).  \nIn mTORC2, which is less sensitive to nutrient levels, mTOR catalyzes the phosphorylation and subsequent activation of AGC family kinases including AKT, PKC isoforms, and SGK1. This arm of mTOR signaling contributes to the regulation of cell survival, proliferation, and the actin cytoskeleton (inoki2005signalingbytarget pages 20-20, inoki2005signalingbytarget pages 17-18). Together, the actions of mTOR in both complexes ensure the proper adjustment of cellular growth programs in response to a myriad of environmental cues, thereby linking extracellular signals with internal metabolic states (inoki2005signalingbytarget pages 17-18, inokiUnknownyearsignalingbytarget pages 22-23).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nPharmacological inhibition of mTOR has attracted extensive attention due to its critical role in oncogenesis, metabolic disorders, and other pathological conditions. Inhibitors such as rapamycin and its analogs (rapalogs) disrupt mTORC1 activity by binding to FKBP12 and interacting with the FRB domain of mTOR; these agents are currently in clinical use as immunosuppressants and anticancer therapies (sabbah2011dualinhibitorsof pages 9-10, inokiUnknownyearsignalingbytarget pages 17-18). In addition, ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors have been developed to target both mTORC1 and mTORC2, thereby overcoming some limitations seen with rapamycin treatment that preferentially inhibits mTORC1 (sabbah2011dualinhibitorsof pages 11-12, sabbah2011dualinhibitorsof pages 16-16).  \nDisease associations related to mTOR dysregulation include various cancers, tuberous sclerosis complex, metabolic syndromes, and neurological disorders; mutations or aberrant signaling in upstream regulators such as PTEN, TSC1/TSC2, and Rheb are commonly linked to these conditions (yeo2018tumoursuppressortuberous pages 26-31, robak2005themammaliantarget pages 3-6). Moreover, mTOR’s involvement in feedback loops that modulate insulin signaling and metabolic reprogramming in cancer further highlights its importance as a therapeutic target. Known inhibitors currently under investigation include dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors as well as mTOR-specific compounds, whose efficacy and selectivity continue to be evaluated in preclinical and clinical settings (sabbah2011dualinhibitorsof pages 13-14, robak2005themammaliantarget pages 12-15).\n\n9.

CDK1/CDC2-cyclin-B controls pronuclear union in interphase fertilized eggs (PubMed:18480403, PubMed:20360007). Essential for early stages of embryonic development (PubMed:18480403, PubMed:20360007). During G2 and early mitosis, CDC25A/B/C-mediated dephosphorylation activates CDK1/cyclin complexes which phosphorylate several substrates that trigger at least centrosome separation, Golgi dynamics, nuclear envelope breakdown and chromosome condensation (PubMed:18480403, PubMed:20360007, PubMed:2188730, PubMed:2344612, PubMed:30139873). Once chromosomes are condensed and aligned at the metaphase plate, CDK1 activity is switched off by WEE1- and PKMYT1-mediated phosphorylation to allow sister chromatid separation, chromosome decondensation, reformation of the nuclear envelope and cytokinesis (PubMed:18480403, PubMed:20360007). Phosphorylates KRT5 during prometaphase and metaphase (By similarity). Inactivated by PKR/EIF2AK2- and WEE1-mediated phosphorylation upon DNA damage to stop cell cycle and genome replication at the G2 checkpoint thus facilitating DNA repair (PubMed:20360007). Reactivated after successful DNA repair through WIP1-dependent signaling leading to CDC25A/B/C-mediated dephosphorylation and restoring cell cycle progression (PubMed:20395957). Catalyzes lamin (LMNA, LMNB1 and LMNB2) phosphorylation at the onset of mitosis, promoting nuclear envelope breakdown (PubMed:2188730, PubMed:2344612, PubMed:37788673). In proliferating cells, CDK1-mediated FOXO1 phosphorylation at the G2-M phase represses FOXO1 interaction with 14-3-3 proteins and thereby promotes FOXO1 nuclear accumulation and transcription factor activity, leading to cell death of postmitotic neurons (PubMed:18356527). The phosphorylation of beta-tubulins regulates microtubule dynamics during mitosis (PubMed:16371510). NEDD1 phosphorylation promotes PLK1-mediated NEDD1 phosphorylation and subsequent targeting of the gamma-tubulin ring complex (gTuRC) to the centrosome, an important step for spindle formation (PubMed:19509060). In addition, CC2D1A phosphorylation regulates CC2D1A spindle pole localization and association with SCC1/RAD21 and centriole cohesion during mitosis (PubMed:20171170). The phosphorylation of Bcl-xL/BCL2L1 after prolongated G2 arrest upon DNA damage triggers apoptosis (PubMed:19917720). In contrast, CASP8 phosphorylation during mitosis prevents its activation by proteolysis and subsequent apoptosis (PubMed:20937773). This phosphorylation occurs in cancer cell lines, as well as in primary breast tissues and lymphocytes (PubMed:20937773). EZH2 phosphorylation promotes H3K27me3 maintenance and epigenetic gene silencing (PubMed:20935635). CALD1 phosphorylation promotes Schwann cell migration during peripheral nerve regeneration (By similarity). CDK1-cyclin-B complex phosphorylates NCKAP5L and mediates its dissociation from centrosomes during mitosis (PubMed:26549230). Regulates the amplitude of the cyclic expression of the core clock gene BMAL1 by phosphorylating its transcriptional repressor NR1D1, and this phosphorylation is necessary for SCF(FBXW7)-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of NR1D1 (PubMed:27238018). Phosphorylates EML3 at 'Thr-881' which is essential for its interaction with HAUS augmin-like complex and TUBG1 (PubMed:30723163). Phosphorylates CGAS during mitosis, leading to its inhibition, thereby preventing CGAS activation by self DNA during mitosis (PubMed:32351706). Phosphorylates SKA3 on multiple sites during mitosis which promotes SKA3 binding to the NDC80 complex and anchoring of the SKA complex to kinetochores, to enable stable attachment of mitotic spindle microtubules to kinetochores (PubMed:28479321, PubMed:31804178, PubMed:32491969)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny:  \nCDK1 is a member of the cyclin‐dependent kinase family, a highly conserved group of serine/threonine protein kinases present in eukaryotes from yeast to humans. Orthologs of CDK1 include CDC28 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and CDC2 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which indicate that the fundamental mechanism of cyclin-dependent control of cell division was established early in evolution (liu2000evolutionofcyclindependent pages 1-1, łukasik2021cyclindependentkinases(cdk) pages 1-2). Within the human kinome, CDK1 belongs to the core set of cell-cycle kinases and is evolutionarily related to other CDKs such as CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6, which together coordinate distinct phases of the cell cycle (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 1-2, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 2-3). Phylogenetic analysis based on conserved catalytic domains has placed CDK1 in the CMGC branch of kinases, which includes cyclin-dependent kinases, MAP kinases, GSKs, and CDK-like kinases, highlighting its central role in controlling mitotic entry and progression (łukasik2021cyclindependentkinases(cdk) pages 29-30). Moreover, evolutionary analyses based on the work of Manning and colleagues show that kinases like CDK1 emerged from an ancestral gene present in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor, with subsequent diversification of cyclin partners to fulfill specialized functions in complex multicellular organisms (liu2000evolutionofcyclindependent pages 1-1).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed:  \nCDK1 catalyzes the phosphorylation of substrate proteins using ATP, transferring the gamma-phosphate from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues in target proteins; the overall catalytic reaction can be summarized as: ATP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 3-5).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements:  \nThe catalytic activity of CDK1 requires the presence of divalent metal ions, predominantly Mg²⁺, which facilitate ATP binding and proper positioning within the kinase active site (shafiq2011molecularmodellingand pages 16-21).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity:  \nCDK1 is a serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates substrates typically within a context that often includes a proline residue immediately following the phosphorylated serine/threonine, reflecting a proline-directed consensus motif; experimental atlases of substrate specificities for the human serine/threonine kinome indicate that this kinase exhibits selectivity toward motifs found on key cell cycle regulatory proteins (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 3-5, pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 9-10, johnson2023substrate*). For additional information regarding the intrinsic substrate preferences of human serine/threonine kinases, see the recent atlas describing kinetic motif interactions (johnson2023substrate*); similarly, in contrast, tyrosine kinases follow distinct substrate recognition rules, as characterized in studies of the human tyrosine kinome (yaron-barir2024substrate*).\n\n5. Structure:  \nCDK1 contains a conserved catalytic kinase domain that is organized into two lobes: an N-terminal lobe primarily composed of β-sheets and a larger C-terminal lobe rich in α-helices; the ATP binding cleft is situated in the inter-lobal region and includes critical residues that form hydrogen bonds with ATP (wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 5-6). Central to the structure is the PSTAIRE helix, a conserved motif that is essential for cyclin binding and activation, as its orientation regulates the positioning of the activation loop – a segment that undergoes phosphorylation (typically at threonine residue T161 in human CDK1) to convert the enzyme to an active conformation (gomes2007analysisofcyclin pages 32-36, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 6-7). Additional structural features include a glycine-rich loop that participates in nucleotide binding and a hydrophobic spine that stabilizes the active conformation, with the C-helix playing a key role in aligning catalytic residues during substrate engagement (wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 2-3, meschini2011purinebaseddualinhibitors pages 51-57). Overall, the three-dimensional organization of CDK1 is characterized by a modular kinase fold that supports both catalytic activity and regulation via conformational changes induced by cyclin binding (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 8-9).\n\n6. Regulation:  \nCDK1 regulation occurs primarily through a series of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events as well as through cyclin binding; association with cyclins A and B induces a conformational rearrangement that is a prerequisite for catalytic activity (gomes2007analysisofcyclin pages 32-36, pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 2-4). Its full activation depends on phosphorylation at the T-loop (for instance, T161 in human CDK1), a modification catalyzed by the CDK-activating kinase (CAK), which in mammals is formed by the CDK7/Cyclin H/MAT1 complex (meschini2011purinebaseddualinhibitors pages 35-41, pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 8-9). In contrast, inhibitory phosphorylation at residues T14 and Y15 by kinases such as Wee1 and Myt1 prevents premature activation; removal of these inhibitory phosphates by a CDC25 family phosphatase triggers mitotic entry (inze2007cellcyclecontrol pages 130-133, pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 7-8). Additional regulation is provided by cell-cycle inhibitors such as the Cip/Kip family members, which can bind to and inhibit CDK1-cyclin complexes under conditions of stress or DNA damage (pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 54-55, łukasik2021cyclindependentkinases(cdk) pages 11-12). This multi-layered regulatory mechanism ensures that CDK1 activity is tightly coupled to proper cell cycle progression and genomic integrity (wang2023targetingcdk1in pages 1-2, shafiq2011molecularmodellingand pages 16-21).\n\n7. Function:  \nCDK1 is essential for the progression of the eukaryotic cell cycle, particularly for the transition from the G2 phase to mitosis; by phosphorylating a myriad of substrates such as components of the centrosome, nuclear lamina, and various regulatory proteins, it orchestrates key events including centrosome separation, nuclear envelope breakdown, chromatin condensation, spindle assembly, and ultimately cytokinesis (gomes2007analysisofcyclin pages 32-36, pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 9-10). CDK1 also phosphorylates proteins involved in the regulation of DNA repair, apoptosis, and transcription, thereby integrating cellular responses to stress and damage; for instance, phosphorylation of FOXO1 in neural cells contributes to the regulation of apoptotic pathways, while modification of lamins facilitates nuclear envelope disassembly during mitosis (pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 9-10, pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 19-20). Its interaction with various cyclins not only modulates its substrate specificity but also ensures temporally controlled activation during distinct cell cycle phases. The critical nature of CDK1 is further underscored by its essentiality for early embryonic development and its role in controlling pronuclear union in fertilized eggs, with aberrant CDK1 activity closely linked to oncogenic transformations (gomes2007analysisofcyclin pages 32-36, łukasik2021cyclindependentkinases(cdk) pages 11-12).\n\n8. Other Comments:  \nSeveral small molecule inhibitors have been developed that target CDK1, with some acting as ATP-competitive inhibitors that occupy the conserved nucleotide-binding pocket; these inhibitors are under investigation for their potential therapeutic use in cancer, where dysregulated CDK1 activity contributes to unchecked cell proliferation and genomic instability (meschini2011purinebaseddualinhibitors pages 73-80, wang2023targetingcdk1in pages 5-5). CDK1 is also known as CDC2 or p34CDC2, and its alternative nomenclature reflects historical naming conventions that arose from early studies in yeast and mammalian systems (gomes2007analysisofcyclin pages 32-36, pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 9-10). In addition, mutations or alterations in regulatory mechanisms affecting CDK1 and its cyclin partners are implicated in various cancers and may serve as biomarkers or targets in precision oncology strategies (wang2023targetingcdk1in pages 8-8, meschini2011purinebaseddualinhibitors pages 64-69). Further research continues to elucidate the complete repertoire of CDK1 substrates and interacting proteins, which include key cell cycle regulators, transcription factors, and proteins involved in DNA repair pathways, enhancing our understanding of its pivotal role in maintaining cellular homeostasis (pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 52-53, rout2018deepinsightsinto pages 15-18).\n\n9.

Triggers duplication of centrosomes and DNA (PubMed:11051553). Acts at the G1-S transition to promote the E2F transcriptional program and the initiation of DNA synthesis, and modulates G2 progression; controls the timing of entry into mitosis/meiosis by controlling the subsequent activation of cyclin B/CDK1 by phosphorylation, and coordinates the activation of cyclin B/CDK1 at the centrosome and in the nucleus (PubMed:18372919, PubMed:19238148, PubMed:19561645). Crucial role in orchestrating a fine balance between cellular proliferation, cell death, and DNA repair in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (PubMed:18372919, PubMed:19238148, PubMed:19561645). Activity of CDK2 is maximal during S phase and G2; activated by interaction with cyclin E during the early stages of DNA synthesis to permit G1-S transition, and subsequently activated by cyclin A2 (cyclin A1 in germ cells) during the late stages of DNA replication to drive the transition from S phase to mitosis, the G2 phase (PubMed:18372919, PubMed:19238148, PubMed:19561645). EZH2 phosphorylation promotes H3K27me3 maintenance and epigenetic gene silencing (PubMed:20935635). Cyclin E/CDK2 prevents oxidative stress-mediated Ras-induced senescence by phosphorylating MYC (PubMed:19966300). Involved in G1-S phase DNA damage checkpoint that prevents cells with damaged DNA from initiating mitosis; regulates homologous recombination-dependent repair by phosphorylating BRCA2, this phosphorylation is low in S phase when recombination is active, but increases as cells progress towards mitosis (PubMed:15800615, PubMed:20195506, PubMed:21319273).

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nCyclin‐dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) is an evolutionarily conserved member of the cyclin‐dependent kinase family. CDK2 orthologs are present from yeast (where the closest homolog is Cdc28 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae) to higher eukaryotes including mammals, illustrating its deep evolutionary roots across species (nigg1995cyclin‐dependentproteinkinases pages 1-2, malumbres2005mammaliancyclindependentkinases pages 1-2). Within the human kinome, CDK2 is classified among the serine/threonine kinases that share a conserved bilobal catalytic domain. It evolved from a common ancestral CDK and, like other kinases in this family, diverged functionally by adopting specific cyclin partners for activation. The evolutionary relationship of CDK2 is well supported by phylogenomic analyses showing conservation of key regulatory motifs such as the PSTAIRE helix, an element shared among various CDKs (nigg1995cyclin‐dependentproteinkinases pages 1-2, malumbres2005mammaliancyclindependentkinases pages 1-2). In summary, CDK2 belongs to a core set of cell cycle regulators whose origin can be traced to the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor, and it maintains a close evolutionary relationship with its paralogs that function in similar proliferative pathways (malumbres2005mammaliancyclindependentkinases pages 1-2, mendenhall1998regulationofcdc28 pages 3-4).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK2 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to specific serine or threonine residues present in substrate proteins. The chemical reaction can be summarized as:  \n  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺  \nThis phosphorylation event is critical for initiating downstream cellular processes such as the progression of the cell cycle. CDK2 thereby functions as an essential regulator that converts ATP-dependent chemical energy into a post-translational modification that alters protein function (chohan2015cyclindependentkinase2as pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of CDK2 is strictly dependent on the presence of ATP, which serves as the phosphate donor during the phosphorylation reaction. In addition to ATP, CDK2 activity requires divalent cations, particularly Mg²⁺, which coordinate with ATP to enable proper binding within the kinase active site. This cofactor is essential for the catalytic efficiency and proper positioning of ATP in the enzyme’s active site, thereby facilitating the phosphorylation of its substrates (chohan2015cyclindependentkinase2as pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCDK2 is a serine/threonine kinase that displays a high degree of substrate specificity determined largely by the amino acid sequence surrounding the target phosphorylation site. In general, CDK2 recognizes substrates that contain a minimal consensus phosphorylation motif consisting of a serine or threonine residue immediately followed by a proline, frequently expanded to the consensus motif (S/T)P-X-(K/R) where X is any amino acid (errico2010identificationofsubstrates pages 4-6). This substrate motif ensures that CDK2 phosphorylates proteins involved in key cellular processes such as DNA replication, cell cycle progression, centrosome duplication, and transcriptional regulation. Comprehensive substrate profiling using high-throughput platforms has reinforced that the intrinsic substrate preference for CDK2 as a serine/threonine kinase aligns with the consensus sequence described in studies of the human serine/threonine kinome (Johnson2023Anatlashift, Yaron-Barir2024Theintrinsic).\n\n5. Structure  \nCDK2 possesses a prototypical kinase fold characterized by a bilobal structure. The N-terminal lobe is primarily composed of β-sheets and includes critical structural elements such as the PSTAIRE helix, which plays a fundamental role in binding cyclin partners. The C-terminal lobe is mainly α-helical and houses the activation loop (T-loop), a flexible segment whose conformation is essential for the regulation of enzymatic activity. In its inactive monomeric form, the T-loop blocks the catalytic cleft, preventing substrate access and alignment of catalytic residues. Upon cyclin binding (typically by cyclin E during the G1/S transition or cyclin A during S and G2 phases), conformational changes occur that reposition the T-loop to expose the active site; this reorientation is further stabilized by phosphorylation at a critical threonine residue (Thr160) by CDK-activating kinase (CAK) (chohan2015cyclindependentkinase2as pages 1-2, harper2001cyclindependentkinases pages 2-4, mendenhall1998regulationofcdc28 pages 6-8). Key catalytic residues such as Lys33, Glu51, and Asp145 are precisely aligned in the active site to coordinate the binding of ATP and subsequent phosphate transfer. Structural studies have revealed a hydrophobic spine that stabilizes the active conformation and a well-defined ATP-binding pocket that is common among CDKs; these features have been exploited in the rational design of CDK2 inhibitors (malumbres2005mammaliancyclindependentkinases pages 3-4, harper2001cyclindependentkinases pages 2-4).\n\n6. Regulation  \nCDK2 activity is regulated by multiple, tightly coordinated mechanisms. First, CDK2 must bind to one of its cyclin partners—cyclin E initially and later cyclin A—which induces a conformational change that partially activates the kinase. Full activation is achieved through the phosphorylation of the T-loop at Thr160, a modification carried out by CDK-activating kinase (Cdk7 in the context of the CDK7/cyclin H/MAT1 complex) (chohan2015cyclindependentkinase2as pages 1-2, malumbres2005mammaliancyclindependentkinases pages 6-7). Conversely, CDK2 can be inhibited by phosphorylation at inhibitory sites, including Thr14 and Tyr15, mediated by Wee1 and Myt1 kinases; these modifications reduce substrate affinity and block catalytic activity until removed by Cdc25 phosphatases (sielecki2000cyclindependentkinaseinhibitors pages 2-4, harper2001cyclindependentkinases pages 2-4). In addition, endogenous CDK inhibitors from the Cip/Kip family such as p21^Cip1, p27^Kip1, and p57^Kip2 bind to CDK2-cyclin complexes, thereby suppressing their kinase activity and providing a further layer of regulation (sielecki2000cyclindependentkinaseinhibitors pages 5-6, malumbres2005mammaliancyclindependentkinases pages 6-7). This combinatorial regulation through cyclin association, activating phosphorylation, inhibitory phosphorylation, and binding of CKIs ensures that CDK2 activity is precisely modulated during the cell cycle to prevent aberrant or premature progression through critical checkpoints (chohan2015cyclindependentkinase2as pages 27-27, mendenhall1998regulationofcdc28 pages 6-8).\n\n7. Function  \nCDK2 is a pivotal regulator of the eukaryotic cell cycle with multiple functions that span both cell proliferation and maintenance of genomic stability. It is primarily active during the G1-to-S phase transition and throughout the S phase, where its activation by cyclin E and later cyclin A triggers the phosphorylation of key substrates required for DNA replication. One of the well‐characterized substrates of CDK2 is the retinoblastoma protein (RB1); its phosphorylation by CDK2 (in collaboration with other CDKs) leads to the release of E2F transcription factors, thereby promoting the transcription of genes essential for DNA synthesis (chohan2015cyclindependentkinase2as pages 1-2, malumbres2005mammaliancyclindependentkinases pages 10-11). In addition, CDK2 phosphorylates other substrates such as NPAT, which regulates histone gene transcription during S phase, and NPM1, whose phosphorylation is implicated in centrosome duplication (chohan2015cyclindependentkinase2as pages 1-2, sielecki2000cyclindependentkinaseinhibitors pages 2-4). Beyond its central role in driving cell cycle transitions, CDK2 is essential for meiosis, as demonstrated by knockout studies in mice where its absence leads to sterility despite largely normal mitotic divisions in somatic cells (chohan2015cyclindependentkinase2as pages 1-2, nigg1995cyclin‐dependentproteinkinases pages 1-2). CDK2 also participates in DNA damage response pathways; for instance, phosphorylation of BRCA2 by CDK2 modulates homologous recombination repair, and its activity within the G1-S DNA damage checkpoint prevents cells with damaged DNA from entering S phase (chohan2015cyclindependentkinase2as pages 22-23, malumbres2005mammaliancyclindependentkinases pages 10-11). Additional substrates include proteins such as MYC, whose phosphorylation by cyclin E/CDK2 prevents oxidative stress‐mediated senescence, and EZH2, which when phosphorylated maintains epigenetic gene silencing (chohan2015cyclindependentkinase2as pages 1-2, malumbres2011physiologicalrelevanceof pages 3-4). Collectively, these functions underscore CDK2’s role in orchestrating a fine balance between cellular proliferation, apoptosis, and DNA repair with defined downstream signaling that includes transcriptional regulation and centrosome duplication (chohan2015cyclindependentkinase2as pages 1-2, tadesse2018cyclindependentkinase2 pages 1-4).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral small molecule inhibitors targeting CDK2 have been developed as anticancer agents due to the enzyme’s frequent deregulation in various tumors. Among these, ATP-competitive inhibitors have been designed to exploit the unique features of the CDK2 ATP-binding pocket that differentiate it from closely related kinases; structure–activity relationship studies have informed the development of compounds with improved selectivity profiles (tadesse2018cyclindependentkinase2 pages 33-36, varun2023rohitukinecontentacross pages 16-16). In addition, natural products and their derivatives, such as rohitukine, have demonstrated potent inhibitory activity against CDK2 and are under investigation as leads for anticancer therapy (varun2023rohitukinecontentacross pages 16-16). Disease associations implicate aberrant overexpression or inadequate inhibition of CDK2 in several types of cancer including breast, ovarian, pancreatic, melanoma, and certain hematologic malignancies; in these contexts, dysregulated CDK2 activity contributes to uncontrolled cellular proliferation and genomic instability (chohan2015cyclindependentkinase2as pages 1-2, tadesse2018cyclindependentkinase2 pages 43-47). Notable mutations affecting CDK2 regulation are less frequently reported compared to other cell cycle regulators; however, alterations in the expression or activity of its regulatory cyclins and CDK inhibitors (such as p27^Kip1) can indirectly influence CDK2 function and are sometimes associated with poor clinical prognosis (łukasik2021cyclindependentkinases(cdk) pages 23-25, tadesse2018cyclindependentkinase2 pages 18-23). In therapeutic contexts, CDK2 inhibition is being explored both as monotherapy and in combination with inhibitors of other components of the cell cycle machinery, such as CDK4/6 inhibitors, to achieve synergistic anticancer effects (tadesse2018cyclindependentkinase2 pages 36-39, łukasik2021cyclindependentkinases(cdk) pages 11-12).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available. Resources that compare the efficacy of these and other compounds against a spectrum of protein kinases should be consulted,  including the Chemical Probes portal (https://www.chemicalprobes.org) supported by the Wellcome Trust, the MRC Kinase Inhibitor Database (www.kinase-screen.mrc.ac.uk/kinase-inhibitors), a resource curated by the NIH (https://pharos.nih.gov/), the protein kinase ontology database (http://prokino.uga.edu/), and the KLIFS (Kinase–Ligand Interaction Fingerprints and Structures) database (https://klifs.net). \n\n\n**Other comments**:\n....\n\n**References**:\n1. ...\n2. ...\n\n\"\"\"\n\n---\n\n# Section Guidelines\n\nFollow the **section numbers and headings** below exactly.

Phylogeny:**  \nCyclin‐dependent kinase 3 (CDK3), also known as cell division protein kinase 3 and encoded by the CDK3/CDKN3 gene, is a serine/threonine kinase that belongs to the cyclin‐dependent kinase family within the broader CMGC group of kinases in the human kinome (babisz2025exploringkinasesubstrate pages 102-106, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 1-2). CDK3 is evolutionarily conserved and has been identified in a wide variety of eukaryotic organisms, ranging from lower eukaryotes to vertebrates. Phylogenetic analyses have demonstrated that the kinase domain of CDK3 is highly conserved relative to those of other cell cycle regulators, such as CDK1 and CDK2, with which it shares a considerable degree of sequence homology and similar catalytic architectures (babisz2025exploringkinasesubstrate pages 168-171, hanks1995theeukaryoticprotein pages 19-20). This conservation reflects its fundamental role in regulating transitions from quiescence into the cell cycle, specifically the transitions from G0 to G1 and from G1 to S phase. Large-scale kinome analyses, including those that integrate data from substrate specificity atlases and deep-learning based proximity studies, group CDK3 with other CDK family members in an evolutionary sub-cluster that emphasizes its role in both cell cycle progression and kinase activation mechanisms (johnson2023anatlasof pages 1-2, jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 22-24, babisz2025exploringkinasesubstrate pages 180-183). Thus, the expansion and diversification of the cyclin‐dependent kinase family during early eukaryotic evolution have assigned CDK3 a specialized function in mediating key cell cycle transitions while retaining a canonical kinase framework (galera2020estudoestruturalcomparativo pages 59-61).\n\n**2. Reaction Catalyzed:**  \nCDK3 catalyzes a phosphorylation reaction that is characteristic of serine/threonine kinases. In this reaction, ATP serves as the phosphate donor and the kinase transfers the γ-phosphate group from ATP to a specific serine or threonine residue on a substrate protein, yielding ADP and a phosphorylated protein (babisz2025exploringkinasesubstrate pages 76-79, johnson2023anatlasof pages 1-2). The reaction can be summarized as:  \n  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺.  \nThis phosphoryl transfer is the core catalytic mechanism by which CDK3 modulates the activity and function of its substrates, thereby influencing processes such as transcriptional activation and the progression of the cell cycle.\n\n**3. Cofactor Requirements:**  \nThe catalytic function of CDK3 is dependent on divalent metal ions, primarily magnesium (Mg²⁺), which act as essential cofactors. Mg²⁺ ions are required because they interact with the phosphate groups of ATP, neutralizing negative charges and orienting ATP properly in the active site of the kinase for efficient catalysis (babisz2025exploringkinasesubstrate pages 102-106, hanks1995theeukaryoticprotein pages 20-21). The presence of Mg²⁺ facilitates the formation of the enzyme–substrate complex, ensuring that the phosphoryl transfer from ATP to the substrate’s serine or threonine residue occurs under optimal conditions.\n\n**4. Substrate Specificity:**  \nCDK3 is a serine/threonine kinase that exhibits substrate specificity consistent with the substrate preferences observed among cyclin‐dependent kinases. According to the substrate specificity atlas provided by Johnson et al. (2023), CDK3 preferentially phosphorylates target proteins that harbor a minimal consensus motif in which a serine or threonine residue is immediately followed by a proline (S/T-P) (johnson2023anatlasof pages 7-7, johnson2023anatlasof pages 4-4). In many cases, substrates with optimal phosphorylation kinetics display additional basic residues, such as lysine or arginine, located at positions downstream (for example, at the +3 position), which further enhance substrate recognition and binding efficiency (johnson2023anatlasof pages 4-5, babisz2025exploringkinasesubstrate pages 157-160). Physiological substrates identified for CDK3 include histone H1, activating transcription factor 1 (ATF1), retinoblastoma protein (RB1), and CABLES1. All these substrates contain sequence regions that are compatible with the proline-directed phosphorylation motif, underscoring the alignment between CDK3’s biochemical activity and the common substrate recognition pattern observed in the CDK family (johnson2023anatlasof pages 6-7).\n\n**5. Structure:**  \nThe three-dimensional structure of CDK3 is predicted to be highly conserved relative to other cyclin‐dependent kinases. CDK3 features a bilobal kinase domain that is organized into two distinct structural lobes. The smaller N-terminal lobe is predominantly composed of β-sheets and encloses the ATP-binding pocket. This region contains a glycine-rich loop, which participates in anchoring the phosphate groups of ATP, and a critical C-helix whose proper positioning is essential for aligning catalytic residues within the active site (babisz2025exploringkinasesubstrate pages 102-106, li2015insightsonstructural pages 5-8). The larger C-terminal lobe primarily consists of α-helices and serves as the substrate-binding region, providing the structural framework for catalytic activity. Embedded within this lobe is the activation loop (T-loop), which undergoes phosphorylation that induces conformational changes necessary for full activation of the enzyme (li2017structuralpredictionof pages 8-8, wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 21-22). Critical conserved motifs such as the DFG motif, which is involved in coordinating Mg²⁺-ATP, and the HRD motif that contains a catalytic aspartate residue, are also present in CDK3 (wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 20-20). Although no high-resolution crystal structure of CDK3 has been reported, homology models based on structural data from closely related kinases—such as CDK2—and predictions provided by AlphaFold indicate that CDK3 adopts the typical CDK fold. Its interaction with cyclin-C (CCNC) during interphase is expected to stabilize the active conformation through the formation of a hydrophobic spine, a structural feature that is central to the function of active CDK–cyclin complexes (babisz2025exploringkinasesubstrate pages 180-183, li2017structuralpredictionof pages 8-8, wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 21-22).\n\n**6. Regulation:**  \nThe regulation of CDK3 activity is achieved through multiple interrelated mechanisms that ensure its activation coincides with specific stages of the cell cycle. A primary regulatory event is its binding to cyclin-C (CCNC), which induces significant conformational rearrangements within the kinase domain. This cyclin binding repositions the activation loop and stabilizes the C-helix, enabling the formation of an active hydrophobic spine that is requisite for efficient substrate phosphorylation (babisz2025exploringkinasesubstrate pages 168-171, shawish2017molecularcloninganda pages 20-24). In addition to cyclin binding, CDK3 is regulated by phosphorylation of its activation loop, a modification that is typically mediated by CDK-activating kinases (CAKs) and is analogous to the activation mechanisms observed in other CDKs such as CDK2 (babisz2025exploringkinasesubstrate pages 180-183, li2017structuralpredictionof pages 8-8). Although the precise phosphorylation sites on CDK3 require further elaboration, these modifications are essential for switching the enzyme from an inactive to an active state. Emerging evidence also suggests that other post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination and interactions with cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs), might provide additional layers of control, albeit their roles in regulating CDK3 remain to be conclusively demonstrated (pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 51-52, sarma2018unveilingthetransient pages 6-7). Such a regulatory network ensures that CDK3 activity is confined to appropriate cell cycle phases, thereby preventing untimely or spurious phosphorylation of substrates (johnson2023anatlasof pages 9-10, babisz2025exploringkinasesubstrate pages 177-180).\n\n**7. Function:**  \nCDK3 serves a central function in the regulation of cell cycle progression by facilitating critical transitions that enable cells to exit quiescence and begin DNA replication. In proliferative cells, CDK3 forms an active complex with cyclin-C during interphase, which is crucial for phosphorylating key substrates that govern cell cycle checkpoints. One of the primary functions of CDK3 is its phosphorylation of histone H1, which is instrumental in chromatin remodeling events required for gene transcription and DNA replication (beaudette1993immunologicalandsubstrate pages 15-19). Additionally, CDK3 phosphorylates activating transcription factor 1 (ATF1); this modification enhances ATF1’s transactivation capabilities, leading to increased transcription of proliferative genes and contributing to cellular transformation (ferguson2019discoveryofcovalent pages 12-13). The retinoblastoma protein (RB1) is another key substrate; phosphorylation of RB1 by the CDK3/cyclin-C complex is essential for facilitating the G0–G1 transition, as it abrogates RB1’s tumor suppressor function and releases E2F transcription factors that drive the transcription of genes imperative for S phase entry (babisz2025exploringkinasesubstrate pages 76-79, babisz2025exploringkinasesubstrate pages 177-180). Moreover, CDK3 promotes the G1–S transition even in pathways that appear to function independently of RB1 by directly influencing the activation status of E2F family members including E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3 (johnson2023anatlasof pages 3-4, jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 24-26). The expression pattern of CDK3 is predominantly observed in cells that are actively proliferating, which supports its role as a critical driver of cell cycle re-entry from the quiescent (G0) state and progression through early G1 (babisz2025exploringkinasesubstrate pages 102-106, beaudette1993immunologicalandsubstrate pages 15-19).\n\n**8. Other Comments:**  \nDespite its pivotal role in controlling cell cycle transitions, selective inhibition of CDK3 remains a challenge. Currently available cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, such as dinaciclib and various purine analogues, exhibit broad-spectrum activity and inhibit CDK3 along with other related CDKs, which has implications for therapeutic targeting in oncology (sarma2025identificationofeffective pages 68-71, pelish2015mediatorkinaseinhibition pages 6-8). Aberrant expression or dysregulation of CDK3 has been associated with aggressive cancer phenotypes, given its involvement in phosphorylating substrates like RB1 and ATF1 that are crucial for cell cycle control and cellular transformation (babisz2025exploringkinasesubstrate pages 177-180, babisz2025exploringkinasesubstrate pages 168-171). Although specific disease-associated mutations in the CDK3 gene are not well characterized in the current literature, its central role in cell cycle progression renders it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for cancer treatment. Ongoing research efforts are directed toward developing more selective inhibitors to minimize off-target effects while effectively suppressing abnormal cell proliferation driven by CDK3 activity (johnson2023anatlasof pages 4-4, babisz2025exploringkinasesubstrate pages 168-171).\n\n**9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nCyclin‐dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is a well‐established member of the cyclin‐dependent kinase family within the larger CMGC kinase group. Comparative genomic studies and extensive sequence analyses have demonstrated that CDK4 is highly conserved among eukaryotes, with orthologous genes identified in unicellular fungi, invertebrates, and vertebrates alike (babisz2025exploringkinasesubstrate pages 177-180, equinet2004studiesonthe pages 106-109). Foundational studies by Manning et al. showed that the complement of protein kinases—including cell cycle regulators like CDK4—has been preserved since early eukaryotic evolution, with ancestral forms traceable to organisms dating back to the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) (equinet2004studiesonthe pages 106-109, babisz2025exploringkinasesubstrate pages 177-180). In phylogenetic trees of the human kinome, CDK4 consistently clusters with other cyclin‐dependent kinases that function primarily during the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Its evolutionary relationships set it apart from kinases that predominantly regulate transcription or mediate stress responses, reflecting its specialized role in driving cell cycle progression (hunter2015theeukaryoticprotein pages 3-6, tong2012…proteinkinases pages 22-33). This conservation of the catalytic domain—as well as the regulatory motifs required for cyclin binding and activation—underscores the fundamental role of CDK4 in proliferative control across diverse eukaryotic lineages (babisz2025exploringkinasesubstrate pages 177-180).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK4 catalyzes an ATP‐dependent phosphorylation reaction that is central to cell cycle regulation. The chemical reaction can be summarized as follows:  \n  ATP + [protein]-(L‑serine or L‑threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(phospho‑L‑serine/threonine) + H⁺  \nIn this reaction, the kinase facilitates the transfer of the γ-phosphate group from ATP to a serine or threonine residue in the substrate protein. This post–translational modification is crucial for modulating the activity, localization, and interaction properties of important regulatory proteins such as those in the retinoblastoma (RB) family. For example, when CDK4 phosphorylates RB1 within the CDK4–cyclin D complex, it results in the disruption of RB1’s interaction with E2F transcription factors, thereby enabling the subsequent transcription of genes essential for progressing through the G1/S checkpoint (babisz2025exploringkinasesubstrate pages 180-183, johnson2023anatlasof pages 10-11).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic function of CDK4 is dependent on specific cofactors, with magnesium ions (Mg²⁺) being indispensable for its activity. Mg²⁺ acts by coordinating with the phosphate groups of ATP, thereby neutralizing negative charges and facilitating the proper orientation of the γ-phosphate for effective transfer to the substrate’s hydroxyl group. This requirement for Mg²⁺ is a canonical feature among serine/threonine protein kinases, ensuring that the phosphorylation reaction proceeds with both fidelity and efficiency (equinet2004studiesonthe pages 106-109, babisz2025exploringkinasesubstrate pages 177-180, johnson2023anatlasof pages 10-11).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nRecent high-throughput substrate profiling studies have clarified the substrate specificity of CDK4. These studies reveal that CDK4 exhibits a marked preference for phosphorylating substrates that contain a serine or threonine residue immediately followed by a proline residue—a motif commonly referred to as a [S/T]–P motif. Moreover, refinements in the substrate consensus sequence indicate that there is frequently an additional preference for a basic residue, such as lysine or arginine, at the +3 position relative to the phosphorylatable residue. In essence, the approximate consensus sequence for substrates phosphorylated by CDK4 can be described as [S/T]–P–x–[K/R], where “x” represents any intervening amino acid (johnson2023anatlasof pages 3-4, babisz2025exploringkinasesubstrate pages 183-186, sugiyama2019largescalediscoveryof pages 6-8). This motif ensures that CDK4 targets physiological substrates—such as various members of the RB protein family and regulatory proteins like SMAD3—with high substrate fidelity and precision.\n\n5. Structure  \nThe three-dimensional architecture of CDK4 conforms to the canonical domain organization observed in cyclin-dependent kinases. The kinase domain is organized into two lobes: a smaller N-terminal lobe and a larger C-terminal lobe, connected by a flexible hinge region that facilitates the proper positioning of ATP. Within the N-terminal lobe, a prominent feature is the glycine-rich loop, also known as the p-loop, which plays a central role in binding ATP by clamping its phosphate groups. A key catalytic lysine residue is situated in this lobe and is instrumental in stabilizing ATP through electrostatic interactions.  \nThe larger C-terminal lobe is characterized by a dominant alpha-helical structure and houses the activation loop (T-loop), a critical regulatory segment. In CDK4, the activation loop contains a threonine residue at position 172 whose phosphorylation by a CDK-activating kinase (CAK) is essential to stabilize the active conformation of the kinase. Another hallmark of the structure is the C-helix within the N-terminal lobe. In many activated cyclin-dependent kinases, the C-helix is repositioned inward to form a salt bridge with the catalytic lysine, a rearrangement necessary for aligning catalytic residues during phosphotransfer. Although full-length high-resolution structures of the intact CDK4–cyclin D complex remain challenging, available crystallographic data—as exemplified by studies that have resolved modified constructs of CDK4 (with engineered truncations or residue substitutions to permit crystallization)—suggest that binding of D-type cyclins prompts subtle yet essential conformational rearrangements in both the C-helix and the activation loop, thus promoting a configuration conducive to catalysis (takaki2009thestructureof pages 1-1, takaki2009thestructureof pages 3-3, liu2021leveragingdiversedata pages 28-33).  \nAdditionally, a hydrophobic spine comprising a contiguous array of nonpolar residues traverses the kinase domain, contributing to the structural integrity and facilitating allosteric communication necessary for the transition between inactive and active states. The regions outside the core kinase domain also include interaction motifs that mediate specific binding to various D-type cyclins (D1, D2, and D3), thereby ensuring the spatiotemporal regulation of CDK4 activity (babisz2025exploringkinasesubstrate pages 177-180, liu2021leveragingdiversedata pages 28-33).\n\n6. Regulation  \nCDK4 activity is subject to a complex regulatory network that integrates multiple positive and negative signals to ensure precise control over cell cycle progression. A primary event in its activation is the binding of D-type cyclins, an association that is essential for the assembly of an active holoenzyme complex. Cyclin binding itself induces conformational changes within CDK4 that result in an increased accessibility of the ATP-binding cleft and primes the kinase for further activation processes. However, cyclin binding alone does not confer full catalytic competence to CDK4. Full activation is achieved through phosphorylation of the activation loop, particularly at threonine 172; this phosphorylation event, catalyzed by a CDK-activating kinase (CAK), stabilizes the activation loop in a conformation that is permissive for substrate binding and catalytic turnover (babisz2025exploringkinasesubstrate pages 177-180, johnson2023anatlasof pages 10-11).  \nIn addition to activating phosphorylation, CDK4 is tightly regulated by a variety of inhibitory proteins. Members of the INK4 family, notably p16INK4a, bind directly to CDK4 and prevent its association with cyclin D, effectively blocking the formation of the active complex. This inhibitory interaction is critical for ensuring that CDK4 is only active under conditions where appropriate mitogenic signals are present. Moreover, the Cip/Kip family protein p27^Kip1 has been observed to associate with the cyclin D–CDK4 complex, where it can either stabilize the complex or inhibit its activity depending on its phosphorylation status. For instance, studies have reported that phosphorylation of p27^Kip1 at specific tyrosine residues induces a conformational change that modulates its affinity for the complex and its overall inhibitory potency (babisz2025exploringkinasesubstrate pages 183-186, baker2012cdk4akey pages 2-3, guiley2019p27allostericallyactivates pages 1-3).  \nBeyond protein–protein interactions, additional layers of regulation involve post–translational modifications. Ubiquitination processes help control the cellular concentration and turnover of CDK4, thereby preventing its accumulation when it is not required for cell cycle progression. Chaperone complexes such as Hsp90/Cdc37 also play a role by assisting in the proper folding and stabilization of CDK4, further ensuring the formation of a functional CDK4–cyclin D complex (babisz2025exploringkinasesubstrate pages 189-190, liu2021leveragingdiversedata pages 33-36, bockstaele2006regulationofcdk4 pages 1-2).\n\n7. Function  \nThe primary biological function of CDK4 is to regulate cell cycle progression through its action during the G1 phase, thereby controlling the transition into the S phase. Upon mitogenic stimulation, an upregulation of D-type cyclins occurs, leading to the formation of active CDK4–cyclin D complexes. These complexes phosphorylate critical substrates, most notably the retinoblastoma protein (RB1). Phosphorylation of RB1 reduces its ability to bind E2F transcription factors, releasing these factors to activate the transcription of genes necessary for DNA synthesis and S-phase entry (babisz2025exploringkinasesubstrate pages 177-180, johnson2023anatlasof pages 3-4).  \nIn addition to RB1, CDK4 also phosphorylates other substrates, such as SMAD3. Phosphorylation of SMAD3 leads to the repression of its transcriptional activity, which links cell cycle regulation with the modulation of specific gene expression programs. CDK4 is commonly found as part of a ternary complex that includes cyclin D and the CDK inhibitor CDKN1B (p27^Kip1). This complex is essential not only for the catalytic function of CDK4 but also for its proper nuclear localization, ensuring that phosphorylation of nuclear substrates such as RB1 is effectively accomplished (babisz2025exploringkinasesubstrate pages 183-186, baker2022cdk4amaster pages 1-2, suryadinata2010controlofcell pages 3-4).  \nFurthermore, CDK4 serves as a critical integrator of mitogenic and antimitogenic signals within the cell. Its activity is modulated by external growth factor stimuli as well as internal cell cycle checkpoints that ensure division only when conditions are favorable. CDK4 is ubiquitously expressed in proliferative tissues and is essential for normal developmental processes as well as for maintaining tissue homeostasis in adult organisms (babisz2025exploringkinasesubstrate pages 177-180, johnson2023anatlasof pages 3-4).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nOwing to its fundamental role in cell cycle regulation, aberrations in CDK4 activity are frequently associated with oncogenesis. Overexpression of D-type cyclins, amplification of the CDK4 gene, or loss of inhibitory proteins such as p16INK4a can lead to uncontrolled kinase activity, resulting in enhanced phosphorylation of RB1 and the subsequent deregulation of cell proliferation. Such dysregulation is implicated in various cancers, including breast cancer, melanoma, and several sarcomas (baker2012cdk4akey pages 1-2, peyressatre2015targetingcyclindependentkinases pages 6-8, sielecki2000cyclindependentkinaseinhibitors pages 2-4).  \nThe clinical relevance of CDK4 is further underscored by the development and approval of small molecule inhibitors that target CDK4 and its closely related kinase CDK6. Compounds such as palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib are ATP-competitive inhibitors that function by preventing the phosphorylation of downstream substrates like RB1, thereby enforcing a G1-phase arrest in cancer cells (baker2012cdk4akey pages 1-2, peyressatre2015targetingcyclindependentkinases pages 6-8). In addition to chemical inhibitors, emerging strategies—such as targeted protein degradation techniques—are being explored to modulate CDK4 levels and activity, reflecting the ongoing effort to refine therapeutic interventions against cancers driven by cell cycle dysregulation (baker2012cdk4akey pages 10-11, peyressatre2015targetingcyclindependentkinases pages 6-8).  \nWithin the context of diagnostic applications, specific mutations in CDK4 that disrupt its inhibitory interactions with p16INK4a have been identified; such mutations are known to lead to constitutive kinase activation. These genetic alterations serve as both biomarkers and therapeutic targets, as they often confer sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors in clinical settings (baker2012cdk4akey pages 10-11, peyressatre2015targetingcyclindependentkinases pages 6-8, sielecki2000cyclindependentkinaseinhibitors pages 2-4).\n\n9.

Interacts with D1 and D3-type G1 cyclins. Phosphorylates SRC, NOS3, VIM/vimentin, p35/CDK5R1, MEF2A, SIPA1L1, SH3GLB1, PXN, PAK1, MCAM/MUC18, SEPT5, SYN1, DNM1, AMPH, SYNJ1, CDK16, RAC1, RHOA, CDC42, TONEBP/NFAT5, MAPT/TAU, MAP1B, histone H1, p53/TP53, HDAC1, APEX1, PTK2/FAK1, huntingtin/HTT, ATM, MAP2, NEFH and NEFM. Regulates several neuronal development and physiological processes including neuronal survival, migration and differentiation, axonal and neurite growth, synaptogenesis, oligodendrocyte differentiation, synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission, by phosphorylating key proteins. Negatively regulates the CACNA1B/CAV2.2 -mediated Ca(2+) release probability at hippocampal neuronal soma and synaptic terminals (By similarity). Activated by interaction with CDK5R1 (p35) and CDK5R2 (p39), especially in postmitotic neurons, and promotes CDK5R1 (p35) expression in an autostimulation loop. Phosphorylates many downstream substrates such as Rho and Ras family small GTPases (e.g. PAK1, RAC1, RHOA, CDC42) or microtubule-binding proteins (e.g. MAPT/TAU, MAP2, MAP1B), and modulates actin dynamics to regulate neurite growth and/or spine morphogenesis. Also phosphorylates exocytosis associated proteins such as MCAM/MUC18, SEPT5, SYN1, and CDK16/PCTAIRE1 as well as endocytosis associated proteins such as DNM1, AMPH and SYNJ1 at synaptic terminals. In the mature central nervous system (CNS), regulates neurotransmitter movements by phosphorylating substrates associated with neurotransmitter release and synapse plasticity; synaptic vesicle exocytosis, vesicles fusion with the presynaptic membrane, and endocytosis. Promotes cell survival by activating anti-apoptotic proteins BCL2 and STAT3, and negatively regulating of JNK3/MAPK10 activity. Phosphorylation of p53/TP53 in response to genotoxic and oxidative stresses enhances its stabilization by preventing ubiquitin ligase-mediated proteasomal degradation, and induces transactivation of p53/TP53 target genes, thus regulating apoptosis. Phosphorylation of p35/CDK5R1 enhances its stabilization by preventing calpain-mediated proteolysis producing p25/CDK5R1 and avoiding ubiquitin ligase-mediated proteasomal degradation. During aberrant cell-cycle activity and DNA damage, p25/CDK5 activity elicits cell-cycle activity and double-strand DNA breaks that precedes neuronal death by deregulating HDAC1. DNA damage triggered phosphorylation of huntingtin/HTT in nuclei of neurons protects neurons against polyglutamine expansion as well as DNA damage mediated toxicity. Phosphorylation of PXN reduces its interaction with PTK2/FAK1 in matrix-cell focal adhesions (MCFA) during oligodendrocytes (OLs) differentiation. Negative regulator of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Activator of the GAIT (IFN-gamma-activated inhibitor of translation) pathway, which suppresses expression of a post-transcriptional regulon of proinflammatory genes in myeloid cells; phosphorylates the linker domain of glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS) in a IFN-gamma-dependent manner, the initial event in assembly of the GAIT complex. Phosphorylation of SH3GLB1 is required for autophagy induction in starved neurons. Phosphorylation of TONEBP/NFAT5 in response to osmotic stress mediates its rapid nuclear localization. MEF2 is inactivated by phosphorylation in nucleus in response to neurotoxin, thus leading to neuronal apoptosis. APEX1 AP-endodeoxyribonuclease is repressed by phosphorylation, resulting in accumulation of DNA damage and contributing to neuronal death. NOS3 phosphorylation down regulates NOS3-derived nitrite (NO) levels. SRC phosphorylation mediates its ubiquitin-dependent degradation and thus leads to cytoskeletal reorganization. May regulate endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis via the modulation of lamellipodia formation. Involved in dendritic spine morphogenesis by mediating the EFNA1-EPHA4 signaling. The complex p35/CDK5 participates in the regulation of the circadian clock by modulating the function of CLOCK protein: phosphorylates CLOCK at 'Thr-451' and 'Thr-461' and regulates the transcriptional activity of the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer in association with altered stability and subcellular distribution**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nCyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) is an atypical member of the cyclin-dependent kinase family that—unlike its classical cell‐cycle counterparts—is primarily restricted to postmitotic neuronal tissues. CDK5 is conserved across vertebrates and is found in species ranging from rodents to humans, indicating that its critical functions in neural development and maintenance have been maintained during evolution (dhariwala2008anunusualmember pages 1-3, su2011cyclindependentkinasesin pages 1-3). Unlike the classical CDKs that cluster with regulators of cell cycle transitions, CDK5 groups phylogenetically with kinases that evolved specialized roles in postmitotic cells. This specialization is supported by the evolutionary studies of the protein kinase complement of the human genome and analyses of kinase family evolution, which show that while CDK5 shares approximately 60% sequence homology with kinases such as CDK1 and CDK2, it has diverged in its regulatory mechanism by adopting neuron‐specific activators rather than canonical cyclins (lopes2011cdk5multitaskingbetween pages 1-6, su2011cyclindependentkinasesin pages 3-5). In addition, phylogenetic surveys based on datasets from Manning et al. reveal that CDK5 occupies a unique branch of the kinome that is separate from cyclin-dependent kinases involved in cell cycle control, consistent with its distinct functions in neuronal signaling and cytoskeletal dynamics.\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nThe reaction catalyzed by CDK5 follows the typical mechanism of protein kinases. In the presence of Mg²⁺ as a cofactor, CDK5 transfers a phosphate group from ATP onto the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues on target proteins that are followed immediately by a proline residue. The overall reaction can be summarized as follows:  \nATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (dhariwala2008anunusualmember pages 1-3, su2011cyclindependentkinasesin pages 1-3).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nCDK5 requires divalent metal ions, most notably Mg²⁺, as a critical cofactor for its kinase activity. The presence of Mg²⁺ facilitates the proper alignment of ATP in the active site of CDK5, thereby enabling efficient catalysis of the phosphate transfer reaction (dhariwala2008anunusualmember pages 1-3, su2011cyclindependentkinasesin pages 1-3).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCDK5 is a proline-directed serine/threonine kinase that exhibits a distinct substrate specificity primarily recognizing a consensus motif in which a serine or threonine residue is immediately followed by a proline (S/TP motif). Studies have indicated that substrates are often further defined by the presence of basic residues, such as lysine or arginine, at the +3 position relative to the phosphorylated site (dhariwala2008anunusualmember pages 1-3, lopes2011cdk5multitaskingbetween pages 1-6). Recent large-scale analyses of substrate specificities within the human serine/threonine kinome further support the notion that CDK5 preferentially phosphorylates sites that conform to such proline-directed motifs (Johnson2023Journal pages 759-766). Although CDK5 is not classified as a tyrosine kinase, considerations of tyrosine kinase substrate preferences from studies by Yaron-Barir2024Journal provide complementary insights into kinase specificity landscapes; however, for CDK5 the defining consensus remains the (S/T)P motif. Hence, substrates that contain sequences such as –R/K–X–(S/T)–P–X–(K/R) are often phosphorylated by CDK5 (dhariwala2008anunusualmember pages 1-3, Johnson2023Journal pages 759-766).\n\n5. Structure  \nThe three-dimensional structure of CDK5 is organized around a central kinase domain that is typical of the cyclin-dependent kinase family. This kinase domain is composed of a smaller N-terminal lobe, rich in β-strands, and a larger C-terminal lobe that is predominantly α-helical. The active site, which includes an ATP-binding pocket, is formed at the interface between these two lobes and contains critical features such as a glycine-rich loop that stabilizes the phosphate groups of ATP and an activation loop that is central to substrate alignment (mapelli2003thestructuralperspective pages 5-6, lim2003proteinproteininteractionsin pages 3-4). Unlike classical CDKs, activation of CDK5 does not require phosphorylation of its activation loop. Instead, CDK5 is activated upon binding to specific non-cyclin regulatory proteins such as p35 and p39. Structural studies have demonstrated that these activators—despite lacking overall sequence similarity to cyclins—adopt a cyclin-like fold that supports the conformational rearrangements needed for full kinase activity (dhariwala2008anunusualmember pages 1-3, mapelli2005mechanismofcdk5p25 pages 1-2). Furthermore, cleavage of p35 by calpain generates p25, whose binding leads to an open activation loop conformation that compromises normal subcellular localization and alters substrate specificity (mapelli2005mechanismofcdk5p25 pages 8-9, lim2003proteinproteininteractionsin pages 8-8). Key catalytic features include a conserved lysine residue in the ATP-binding region that forms a salt bridge with a glutamic acid in the C-helix and a hydrophobic spine that contributes to structural stability and the proper positioning of the substrate (mapelli2003thestructuralperspective pages 6-8, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 5-6).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of CDK5 is unique among the cyclin-dependent kinases. Rather than relying on periodic expression of cyclin partners and phosphorylation of a T-loop for activation, CDK5 is controlled almost exclusively through its interaction with neuron-specific regulatory subunits p35 and p39, as well as the pathological p25 fragment derived from p35 by calpain-mediated proteolysis (dhariwala2008anunusualmember pages 1-3, lim2003proteinproteininteractionsin pages 3-4). Binding of these activators induces a conformational change in CDK5 that results in full catalytic activation without the need for activating phosphorylation on the T-loop (mapelli2003thestructuralperspective pages 5-6, sharma2020akinaseof pages 1-2). Additionally, CDK5 activity is modulated by phosphorylation at specific residues. For instance, phosphorylation at Tyr15—catalyzed by non-receptor tyrosine kinases such as c-Abl and Fyn—enhances its activity, while phosphorylation at Thr14 can have inhibitory effects (dhariwala2008anunusualmember pages 3-5, sharma2020akinaseof pages 3-4). CDK5 is further regulated by negative feedback mechanisms; for example, autophosphorylation events on its activator p35 enhance its stability by preventing calpain-mediated cleavage. Conversely, cleavage of p35 to p25 disrupts membrane targeting and prolongs the kinase’s activity, contributing to aberrant phosphorylation of substrates implicated in neurodegenerative disorders (dhariwala2008anunusualmember pages 6-8, roufayel2019cdk5keyregulator pages 5-7). Regulation also occurs via protein–protein interactions with additional modulators such as cyclin I in non-neuronal cells, which can influence apoptotic and pro-survival signaling pathways (roufayel2019cdk5keyregulator pages 9-11, shupp2017biologicalfunctionsof pages 4-6).\n\n7. Function  \nCDK5 plays an essential role in multiple neuronal processes as well as in some non-neuronal functions. In the central nervous system, CDK5 is critical for neuronal migration, neurite outgrowth, axon guidance, and dendritic spine morphogenesis. It accomplishes these tasks by phosphorylating a broad array of substrates involved in cytoskeletal dynamics, such as microtubule-associated proteins (MAPT/TAU, MAP1B, and MAP2) and regulators of actin remodeling (PAK1, RAC1, RHOA, and CDC42) (dhariwala2008anunusualmember pages 1-3, lopes2011cdk5multitaskingbetween pages 1-6). In synaptic terminals, CDK5 modulates neurotransmitter release by phosphorylating proteins that govern both exocytosis (e.g., SYN1, MUNC18, AMPH) and endocytosis processes (e.g., DNM1 and SYNJ1). In addition, CDK5 regulates cell survival by phosphorylating factors such as p53 and by activating anti-apoptotic proteins including BCL2 and STAT3, thereby influencing the balance between cell death and survival in neurons experiencing genotoxic or oxidative stress (roufayel2019cdk5keyregulator pages 7-9, su2011cyclindependentkinasesin pages 3-5). Beyond neuronal cells, CDK5 is expressed in pancreatic beta cells, where it has been shown to regulate insulin secretion through modulation of calcium channel activity; it also plays roles in immune cells, endothelial cells, and certain cancer cell types, affecting proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis (sharma2020akinaseof pages 1-2, pozo2016theemergingrole pages 1-3). Moreover, CDK5 has been found to negatively regulate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and to activate the GAIT pathway in myeloid cells, further demonstrating its involvement in diverse cellular signaling networks (dhariwala2008anunusualmember pages 1-3, peyressatre2015targetingcyclindependentkinases pages 4-6).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral inhibitors targeting CDK5 have been identified, including small molecules such as roscovitine (also known as seliciclib) and olomoucine, which inhibit its kinase activity by competing for the ATP-binding site; however, these compounds generally lack specificity due to overlapping inhibition of other CDKs (shupp2017biologicalfunctionsof pages 7-8, sharma2020akinaseof pages 8-9). In addition, peptide inhibitors like the CDK5 inhibitory peptide (CIP), which is derived from the p35 activator domain, have been developed to selectively block the hyperactive CDK5/p25 complex without affecting physiological CDK5/p35 function, thereby offering potential therapeutic benefits in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease (shah2018taleofthe pages 1-3, shupp2017biologicalfunctionsof pages 8-9). Disease associations for CDK5 include neurodegenerative disorders—where deregulated kinase activity, particularly through the generation of p25, leads to abnormal phosphorylation of tau and other substrates—and certain cancers, in which CDK5 overexpression or hyperactivation contributes to tumor cell proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and immune escape (pozo2016theemergingrole pages 12-13, shupp2017biologicalfunctionsof pages 7-8). Notable substrates of CDK5 in the context of disease are microtubule-binding proteins such as MAPT/TAU, whose hyperphosphorylation is a hallmark of Alzheimer’s pathology, as well as critical regulators of apoptosis like p53 (dhariwala2008anunusualmember pages 6-8, roufayel2019cdk5keyregulator pages 9-11). In addition, CDK5’s involvement in the regulation of neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity underscores its potential as a target in neurological disorders that feature synapse dysfunction.  \nFurthermore, CDK5 has been implicated in the regulation of circadian rhythms through phosphorylation of clock proteins, and it modulates endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis via substrates such as PTK2/FAK1 (dhariwala2008anunusualmember pages 6-8, su2011cyclindependentkinasesin pages 3-5). These diverse roles, together with its unique regulation by non-cyclin activators and the differential outcomes of its hyperactive versus physiological states, establish CDK5 as a multifaceted kinase of considerable therapeutic and investigative interest.\n\n9.

Phosphorylates pRB/RB1 and NPM1. Interacts with D-type G1 cyclins during interphase at G1 to form a pRB/RB1 kinase and controls the entrance into the cell cycle. Involved in initiation and maintenance of cell cycle exit during cell differentiation; prevents cell proliferation and negatively regulates cell differentiation, but is required for the proliferation of specific cell types (e.g. erythroid and hematopoietic cells). Essential for cell proliferation within the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles. Required during thymocyte development. Promotes the production of newborn neurons, probably by modulating G1 length. Promotes, at least in astrocytes, changes in patterns of gene expression, changes in the actin cytoskeleton including loss of stress fibers, and enhanced motility during cell differentiation. Prevents myeloid differentiation by interfering with RUNX1 and reducing its transcription transactivation activity, but promotes proliferation of normal myeloid progenitors. Delays senescence. Promotes the proliferation of beta-cells in pancreatic islets of Langerhans.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695).

Phylogeny  \nCDK6 is a member of the cyclin‐dependent kinase family that is evolutionarily conserved across vertebrates and is classified within the CDK4 subfamily, sharing approximately 71% amino acid identity with CDK4 (grossel2006beyondthecell pages 1-2). Orthologs of CDK6 can be found in all mammalian species, and its evolutionary relationship is defined by its expansion from a common eukaryotic ancestor into specialized cell cycle regulators in higher organisms (fassl2022cdk4andcdk6 pages 1-3, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK6 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to specific serine or threonine residues on target substrate proteins. In biochemical terms, its reaction can be summarized as: ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (fassl2022cdk4andcdk6 pages 1-3, suryadinata2010controlofcell pages 1-3).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of CDK6 depends on the presence of ATP as a phosphate donor and requires divalent cations, most notably Mg²⁺, as essential cofactors for proper coordination within the active site (huwe2003smallmoleculesas pages 1-3, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 9-10).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCDK6 exhibits substrate specificity characteristic of serine/threonine kinases. It primarily phosphorylates target proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, such as the retinoblastoma protein (pRB/RB1) and nucleophosmin (NPM1) (fassl2022cdk4andcdk6 pages 1-3, grossel2006fromcellcycle pages 1-2). Recent atlas studies of human serine/threonine kinome substrate specificities have outlined consensus motifs for these kinases; although specific motif details for CDK6 have not been exclusively defined in context, the enzyme preferentially targets serine/threonine residues embedded within regulatory domains of its substrates (Johnson2023Atlas of Substrate Specificities for the Human Serine/Threonine Kinome, Nature 613(7945); Yaron-Barir2024Intrinsic Substrate Specificity of the Human Tyrosine Kinome, Nature 629(8014)).\n\n5. Structure  \nCDK6 contains a central catalytic domain that adopts the classic bilobal kinase fold, with an N-terminal lobe primarily composed of beta-sheets and a larger C-terminal lobe rich in alpha-helices. The enzyme possesses the conserved PLSTIRE motif in its C-helix, which is characteristic of the CDK4/6 subfamily (fassl2022cdk4andcdk6 pages 1-3, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 3-5). Key structural features include the activation loop (T-loop) that harbors Thr177, whose phosphorylation is critical for full catalytic activity, and the ATP-binding pocket in which residues such as Lys43 and Asp163 orient ATP for the phosphoryl transfer reaction (lu2005crystalstructureof pages 2-2, tadesse2015targetingcdk6in pages 13-16). Additional studies have identified unique elements such as a relatively short β3–αC loop and an unstructured C-terminal region that aids in stabilizing the regulatory spine, contributing to allosteric network differences between CDK6 and its paralog CDK4 (zhang2025distinctallostericnetworks pages 19-21, zhang2025distinctallostericnetworks pages 24-27). Furthermore, crystal structures of CDK6 in complex with small molecule inhibitors, such as fisetin, have provided insights into the inhibitor binding mode and subtle conformational changes that occur upon ligand engagement (lu2005crystalstructureof pages 2-2).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe activity of CDK6 is tightly regulated by multiple mechanisms. Its activation requires binding to D-type cyclins (cyclin D1, D2, and D3), which induce conformational changes necessary for catalytic activity (fassl2022cdk4andcdk6 pages 1-3, tadesse2015targetingcdk6in pages 1-6). Full activation also depends on phosphorylation of Thr177 within the T-loop by the CDK-activating kinase (CAK), comprising CDK7, cyclin H, and MAT1 (tadesse2015targetingcdk6in pages 13-16). Inhibitory proteins from the INK4 family—such as p16^INK4a, p15^INK4b, p18^INK4c, and p19^INK4d—bind CDK6 either in its monomeric state or within cyclin D–CDK6 complexes to prevent proper cyclin interaction and alignment of catalytic residues, thereby blocking kinase activity (bockstaele2009differentialregulationof pages 1-2, sielecki2000cyclindependentkinaseinhibitors pages 5-6). In addition, Cip/Kip family inhibitors (p21^Cip1, p27^Kip1, and p57^Kip2) contribute to regulation by modulating complex assembly, stabilization, and subcellular localization, with their phosphorylation state further influencing whether they act as inhibitors or assembly factors (nebenfuehr2020theroleof pages 5-6, tadesse2015targetingcdk6in pages 13-16). Other post-translational modifications, such as inhibitory phosphorylations by kinases like Wee1 and Myt1 and subsequent dephosphorylation by Cdc25 phosphatases, also contribute to the fine-tuning of CDK6 activity (tadesse2015targetingcdk6in pages 13-16, suryadinata2010controlofcell pages 9-10).\n\n7. Function  \nCDK6 plays a critical role in regulating the G1 phase of the cell cycle by phosphorylating the retinoblastoma protein (pRB/RB1) and related proteins, which in turn facilitates the release of E2F transcription factors necessary for G1/S transition (fassl2022cdk4andcdk6 pages 1-3, grossel2006fromcellcycle pages 1-2). In addition to its canonical role in promoting cell cycle progression, CDK6 is involved in a variety of differentiation processes. It is required for the proliferation of select cell types, including erythroid and hematopoietic cells, and plays a role in thymocyte development, neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus and subventricular zone, and proliferation of beta-cells in pancreatic islets (fassl2022cdk4andcdk6 pages 1-3, grossel2006fromcellcycle pages 4-5, nebenfuehr2020theroleof pages 1-3). Furthermore, CDK6 functions as a modulator of differentiation by influencing transcriptional programs, altering actin cytoskeletal organization, and affecting cell motility, particularly in astrocytes where it mediates changes linked to differentiation (fassl2022cdk4andcdk6 pages 3-4, grossel2006beyondthecell pages 1-2). CDK6’s activity is also implicated in delaying cellular senescence and preventing myeloid differentiation by interfering with the transcriptional activity of RUNX1, thus promoting proliferation in normal progenitors while modulating differentiation in pathological contexts (grossel2006fromcellcycle pages 4-4, tadesse2015targetingcdk6in pages 35-38).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nMultiple pharmacological inhibitors targeting CDK6 have been developed, including clinically approved dual CDK4/6 inhibitors such as palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib, which function by competing with ATP binding and thereby arresting G1 phase progression in cancer cells (goel2022targetingcdk4and pages 1-3, tadesse2015targetingcdk6in pages 38-41). CDK6 dysregulation, through overexpression or loss of its endogenous inhibitors, is associated with various cancers including breast cancer, glioblastoma, and hematological malignancies. Furthermore, recent studies reveal that differences in the allosteric networks of CDK6 may contribute to resistance against CDK4/6 inhibitors, emphasizing the ongoing need for refinement of therapeutic strategies (zhang2025distinctallostericnetworks pages 1-4, tadesse2015targetingcdk6in pages 20-24). These inhibitors and their ongoing clinical investigations highlight the therapeutic relevance of targeting CDK6 in oncology (peyressatre2015targetingcyclindependentkinases pages 27-30, tadesse2015targetingcdk6in pages 35-38).\n\n9.

Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are activated by the binding to a cyclin and mediate the progression through the cell cycle. Each different complex controls a specific transition between 2 subsequent phases in the cell cycle. Required for both activation and complex formation of CDK1/cyclin-B during G2-M transition, and for activation of CDK2/cyclins during G1-S transition (but not complex formation). CDK7 is the catalytic subunit of the CDK-activating kinase (CAK) complex. Phosphorylates SPT5/SUPT5H, SF1/NR5A1, POLR2A, p53/TP53, CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, CDK6 and CDK11B/CDK11. CAK activates the cyclin-associated kinases CDK1, CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6 by threonine phosphorylation, thus regulating cell cycle progression. CAK complexed to the core-TFIIH basal transcription factor activates RNA polymerase II by serine phosphorylation of the repetitive C-terminal domain (CTD) of its large subunit (POLR2A), allowing its escape from the promoter and elongation of the transcripts (PubMed:9852112). Phosphorylation of POLR2A in complex with DNA promotes transcription initiation by triggering dissociation from DNA. Its expression and activity are constant throughout the cell cycle. Upon DNA damage, triggers p53/TP53 activation by phosphorylation, but is inactivated in turn by p53/TP53; this feedback loop may lead to an arrest of the cell cycle and of the transcription, helping in cell recovery, or to apoptosis.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny:**  \nCyclin‐dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that belongs to the cyclin‐dependent kinase (CDK) family, itself a subgroup of the larger CMGC group of kinases. Orthologs of CDK7 have been identified across a broad spectrum of eukaryotic organisms, ranging from simple yeasts to plants, invertebrates, and mammals. This deep evolutionary conservation reflects the essential and nonredundant roles that CDK7 has played since the early divergence of the eukaryotic lineage, with evidence suggesting that the core set of kinases including CDK7 was already present in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) (alexander2015mutationalanalysisof pages 9-14, alexander2015mutationalanalysisofa pages 9-14). In mammals, CDK7 functions as the catalytic subunit of the CDK-activating kinase (CAK) complex, and phylogenetic studies have revealed that its evolutionary relationship with other cell cycle kinases such as CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6 stems from ancient gene duplication and subsequent divergence events. Furthermore, analyses focusing on kinase family evolution have firmly established that the domain architecture and sequence motifs in CDK7 have been maintained over hundreds of millions of years, underscoring its dual roles in cell cycle regulation and transcriptional control (alrawi2023cyclinaand pages 6-8, alrouji2025mechanisticrolesof pages 18-20). Overall, the conservation of CDK7 across diverse species indicates its indispensable function in both the regulation of cell division and the transcription of key genes necessary for cell survival and proliferation (delaney2012thebiologyof pages 15-21).\n\n**2. Reaction Catalyzed:**  \nCDK7 catalyzes a classical phosphorylation reaction that is typical of protein kinases. In this reaction, the gamma‐phosphate from ATP is transferred to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues present on target protein substrates. The reaction can be formally expressed as:  \n  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺.  \nThis transfer of the phosphate group is the critical biochemical event that underpins CDK7’s ability to activate its substrates. In particular, CDK7 phosphorylates a threonine residue in the activation loop (T-loop) region of other cyclin‐dependent kinases—an event that is essential for converting these kinases from an inactive to an active state, thereby facilitating progression through specific cell cycle transitions. Moreover, the same catalytic activity of CDK7 is used in the phosphorylation of multiple repeats within the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II, a modification that is crucial for the initiation and elongation phases of transcription (duster2021biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 28-31, krauss2006biochemistryofsignal pages 275-277).\n\n**3. Cofactor Requirements:**  \nThe catalytic function of CDK7, like that of other serine/threonine kinases, is dependent on the presence of specific divalent metal ion cofactors. In particular, the presence of Mg²⁺ is essential for its enzymatic activity. Mg²⁺ ions bind within the kinase’s catalytic cleft along with ATP, facilitating proper ATP orientation and stabilization of the phosphoryl transfer transition state. This interaction is critical to ensure the efficient and accurate transfer of the phosphate group to the substrate’s serine or threonine residue (krauss2006biochemistryofsignal pages 275-277, duster2021biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 28-31).\n\n**4. Substrate Specificity:**  \nCDK7 exhibits substrate specificity that is characteristic of proline-directed serine/threonine kinases. High-throughput phosphoproteomic studies have established that CDK7 preferentially phosphorylates substrates exhibiting a minimal consensus motif in which a serine or threonine residue is immediately followed by a proline ([S/T]P). This preference is exemplified by its involvement in phosphorylating the key threonine residues in the activation loops of other cyclin‐dependent kinases – including CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6 – modifications that are essential for their catalytic activation and subsequent role in cell cycle progression (johnson2023anatlasof pages 6-7, brewer2024mappingthesubstrate pages 7-10). In addition to these substrates, CDK7 is responsible for phosphorylation of the repetitive heptapeptide sequences (YSPTSPS) in the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (POLR2A). In this context, the kinase exhibits a pronounced specificity for phosphorylating the serine residue at position 5 of the heptad repeat, a modification that directly impacts promoter clearance and transition to transcription elongation. Additional substrates include regulatory proteins such as SF1/NR5A1, implicated in splicing, SPT5/SUPT5H, which is involved in transcription elongation, and the tumor suppressor p53/TP53 – a substrate whose phosphorylation is pivotal in mediating the DNA damage response (johnson2023anatlasof pages 7-7, yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 7-8, duster2021biochemicalcharacterizationofa pages 11-15).\n\n**5. Structure:**  \nThe three-dimensional structure of CDK7 is characterized by a highly conserved serine/threonine kinase domain that adopts the typical bilobed architecture observed in eukaryotic protein kinases. The N-terminal lobe of this domain is predominantly composed of β-sheets and features the conserved C-helix, which is crucial for binding ATP and for the proper positioning of catalytic residues. In contrast, the C-terminal lobe is mainly α-helical and forms the substrate-binding pocket while also housing the catalytic loop. A key structural determinant of CDK7’s activity is the activation loop (T-loop); this segment must be phosphorylated to enable the conformational rearrangements necessary for optimal substrate binding and catalysis.  \nCDK7 does not function in isolation; it is the catalytic core of the CDK-activating kinase (CAK) complex. This multiprotein complex includes cyclin H, which binds to CDK7 and triggers a conformational realignment—especially of the C-helix and activation loop—that is essential for its catalytic activity, and MAT1, an assembly factor that further stabilizes the active conformation of CDK7 and may influence substrate recognition. X-ray crystallography data and computational models produced by AlphaFold have both confirmed that within the CAK complex, the ATP-binding pocket is well defined, and key motifs such as the DFG motif are present to coordinate Mg²⁺ binding, while the hydrophobic spine maintains an active conformation. Specific structural features, such as subtle differences in the P+1 loop, contribute to CDK7’s dual substrate specificity for proteins involved in cell cycle regulation and transcription (duster2024structuralbasisof pages 1-4, johnson2014conservationandstructural pages 12-15, korolchuk2018structuralandfunctional pages 252-255). Furthermore, when incorporated into the TFIIH basal transcription factor complex, the structure of CDK7 is modulated to favor phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain, thereby integrating its catalytic functions with the regulation of gene expression (duster2021biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 28-31, johnson2014conservationandstructural pages 12-15).\n\n**6. Regulation:**  \nRegulatory control of CDK7 is achieved by a combination of complex formation and post-translational modifications. At the core of its regulation is the formation of the CAK complex, comprising CDK7, cyclin H, and MAT1. This complex assembly is necessary for eliciting conformational changes—most notably, the repositioning of the C-helix and stabilization of the activation loop—that significantly enhance the kinase’s catalytic activity. In the absence of cyclin H, CDK7 remains in a low-activity or inactive conformation (duster2021biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 11-15, duster2021biochemicalcharacterizationofa pages 11-15).  \nIn addition to its regulation by complex formation, CDK7 is subject to post-translational modifications. Phosphorylation of the activation loop (T-loop) by upstream kinases such as CDK1 or CDK2 further augments its activity. Under conditions of DNA damage, CDK7 phosphorylates the transcription factor p53 at specific serine and threonine residues; this activation of p53 triggers downstream cell cycle arrest and apoptotic pathways. In turn, activated p53 establishes a negative feedback loop by inactivating CDK7, thereby preventing further cell cycle progression and transcription under conditions where the genome integrity is compromised (delaney2012thebiologyof pages 32-35, duster2021biochemicalcharacterizationofa pages 116-118, jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 22-24). Although additional modifications such as ubiquitination or acetylation might occur within kinase networks, the predominant regulatory mechanisms of CDK7 revolve around its complex formation with cyclin H and MAT1 as well as phosphorylation dynamics that govern its activity and substrate specificity (jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 22-24).\n\n**7. Function:**  \nCDK7 plays a central and indispensable role in regulating both the cell cycle and transcription. As the catalytic subunit of the CAK complex, CDK7 is responsible for the phosphorylation and activation of several critical cyclin-dependent kinases including CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6. The phosphorylation of a threonine residue within the T-loop of these kinases is essential for their activation and proper function during the G1-S and G2-M transitions, thereby ensuring that cell division proceeds in a regulated and orderly manner (duster2021biochemicalcharacterizationofa pages 33-37, kumar2021identificationofcdk7 pages 20-21).  \nIn addition to its pivotal role in cell cycle control, CDK7 is deeply integrated into the regulation of gene expression. When incorporated into the TFIIH basal transcription factor complex, CDK7 phosphorylates the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (POLR2A). This phosphorylation event, particularly on the serine residues within the YSPTSPS heptad repeats, is essential for promoter clearance and proper transition to the elongation phase of transcription. Beyond RNA polymerase II, CDK7 phosphorylates other key substrates such as SPT5/SUPT5H, which is involved in transcription elongation, SF1/NR5A1, which plays a role in RNA splicing, and the tumor suppressor p53/TP53. Phosphorylation of p53 by CDK7 is a critical step in the DNA damage response, as it leads to the activation of cell cycle checkpoints and can initiate apoptosis when genomic damage is severe. Importantly, CDK7 expression and activity remain relatively constant throughout the cell cycle, ensuring that both cell division and transcription processes are continuously maintained to support normal cellular homeostasis (johnson2023anatlasof pages 7-7, jiang2025decipheringthedark pages 15-16, delaney2012thebiologyof pages 35-39).\n\n**8. Other Comments:**  \nCDK7 has garnered significant attention as a therapeutic target in oncology due to its dual regulatory roles in both cell cycle progression and transcription. Aberrant expression and/or hyperactivation of CDK7 have been observed in a variety of malignancies, including breast, ovarian, high-grade glioma, and pancreatic cancers. Such dysregulation often correlates with aggressive tumor growth, increased proliferation, and poor clinical prognosis. As a result, several CDK7 inhibitors have been developed. One notable example is THZ1, a covalent inhibitor that targets a unique cysteine residue in the ATP-binding pocket of CDK7, thereby disrupting its kinase activity. These inhibitors have demonstrated potent antitumor effects by impairing the activation of downstream CDKs as well as by reducing RNA polymerase II phosphorylation, which collectively result in cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis in cancer cells (hope2023emergingapproachesto pages 8-9, kumar2021identificationofcdk7 pages 20-21).  \nFurthermore, the feedback regulatory loop involving CDK7 and p53 adds another layer of clinical relevance. Upon DNA damage, the activation of p53 by CDK7 sets in motion a cascade that ultimately leads to the negative regulation of CDK7, thereby preventing cell division when it is unsafe for cells to proliferate. Targeting this interplay represents a promising avenue for cancer therapy, particularly in tumors that harbor aberrations in p53 signaling pathways. Additionally, the constitutive nature of CDK7 expression underscores its potential as a consistent therapeutic target, although the challenge of minimizing off-target effects remains.  \nThere is also ongoing research leveraging advanced methodologies such as deep learning–coupled proximity proteomics to further delineate the extensive substrate networks of CDK7. Such studies are refining our understanding of the kinase’s interactions and may lead to the identification of additional regulatory nodes that could be exploited in drug design. In summary, the dual roles of CDK7 in stimulating both cell cycle progression and transcription underscore its importance in normal physiology as well as its pathological significance in cancer, positioning it as a key candidate for therapeutic intervention (jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 20-22, jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 24-26).\n\n**9.

Promotes RNA synthesis in genetic programs for cell growth, differentiation and viral pathogenesis (PubMed:10393184, PubMed:11112772). P-TEFb is also involved in cotranscriptional histone modification, mRNA processing and mRNA export (PubMed:15564463, PubMed:19575011, PubMed:19844166). Modulates a complex network of chromatin modifications including histone H2B monoubiquitination (H2Bub1), H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and H3K36me3; integrates phosphorylation during transcription with chromatin modifications to control co-transcriptional histone mRNA processing (PubMed:15564463, PubMed:19575011, PubMed:19844166).

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nCDK9 is a member of the cyclin‐dependent kinase (CDK) family that is evolutionarily conserved among eukaryotes and plays a specialized role in transcription regulation rather than cell cycle progression (asamitsu2022identificationofa pages 1-2). CDK9 is grouped within the CMGC kinase clan, sharing a conserved catalytic domain with other serine/threonine kinases such as CDK7, CDK8, CDK12, and CDK13, and its evolutionary history can be traced back to early eukaryotic ancestors (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 1-2). Orthologs of CDK9 are present in a wide range of species, with human CDK9 being the functional counterpart of yeast Bur1 kinase, indicating an ancient origin and conservation of the transcription‐regulating function across metazoans (asamitsu2022identificationofa pages 2-4). Phylogenetic analyses, as exemplified in studies on the protein kinase complement of the human genome and subsequent reviews on kinase evolution, place CDK9 in close relation to other transcriptional CDKs that are non–cell cycle‐dependent (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 3-5).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK9 catalyzes the phosphorylation reaction in which ATP and a protein substrate containing serine or threonine residues are converted into ADP and a phosphorylated protein, specifically targeting the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II in the process (asamitsu2022identificationofa pages 1-2). This reaction is central to the conversion of abortive transcription initiation into productive elongation by transferring a phosphate group from ATP to serine residues within the heptapeptide repeats of the CTD (asamitsu2022identificationofa pages 2-4).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of CDK9 is dependent on the binding of ATP as the phosphate donor and requires the presence of divalent cations, predominantly Mg²⁺, to facilitate proper catalytic function (asamitsu2022identificationofa pages 1-2). The catalytic efficiency of CDK9 further relies on its association with regulatory cyclins such as cyclin T1, which act as essential cofactors for its activation (boubacar2024computationalmethodsfor pages 24-27).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCDK9 exhibits substrate specificity characterized primarily by its activity toward the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, phosphorylating serine residues—especially Ser2—in a context that often shows preferences for adjacent amino acid sequences influenced by local substrate context (johnson2023anatlasof pages 3-4). High-throughput kinase substrate profiling has revealed that CDK9, as a serine/threonine kinase, shows a preference for substrates involved in transcription elongation and factors such as SUPT5H and RDBP, with the consensus sequence reflecting its proline-directed phosphorylation characteristics (johnson2023anatlasof pages 2-3). The substrate motif analysis supports that CDK9, in complex with its cyclin partner, prefers motifs that facilitate the phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II CTD, aligning with its role in transcription regulation (asamitsu2022identificationofa pages 9-11).\n\n5. Structure  \nCDK9 contains a central catalytic kinase domain that displays the typical bilobal architecture seen in serine/threonine kinases, comprising a smaller N-terminal lobe rich in β-sheets and a larger C-terminal lobe containing predominantly α-helices (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 6-7). The N-terminal lobe includes the glycine-rich loop (G-loop) involved in ATP binding, while the C-terminal lobe features the activation loop and the C-helix, both of which are critical for substrate recognition and catalytic activity (asamitsu2022identificationofa pages 4-6). Unique structural aspects of CDK9 include a dynamic ATP-binding pocket and a regulatory “hidden cavity” that can be unmasked upon binding of the HIV-1 Tat protein, a feature that has been exploited for inhibitor design (asamitsu2022identificationofa pages 11-13). Additionally, the association with cyclin T1 induces conformational changes that optimally position essential catalytic residues, and the kinase domain possesses key amino acids that are conserved across CDKs, including those in the DFG motif and the catalytic loop (boubacar2024computationalmethodsfor pages 27-33).\n\n6. Regulation  \nCDK9 is regulated at multiple levels through post-translational modifications, protein–protein interactions, and complex formation. Phosphorylation of key residues in the T-loop, such as Thr186, is necessary for full activation of the kinase and is mediated by CDK-activating kinases or via autophosphorylation events that are dependent on cyclin binding (asamitsu2022identificationofa pages 1-2). In addition, CDK9 activity is negatively regulated by its sequestration within the 7SK small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex, which includes the inhibitory proteins 7SK snRNA and HEXIM1; release from this inhibitory complex is essential for promoting transcription elongation (asamitsu2022identificationofa pages 13-14). The regulatory mechanism is further modulated by interactions with viral proteins such as HIV-1 Tat, which bind to CDK9/cyclin T complexes and induce unique conformational rearrangements that expose otherwise hidden regulatory cavities, thereby altering kinase activity and substrate specificity (asamitsu2022identificationofa pages 6-9).\n\n7. Function  \nCDK9 plays a pivotal role in promoting transcriptional elongation by phosphorylating the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, thereby facilitating the transition from a paused to an elongating form of the polymerase (asamitsu2022identificationofa pages 1-2). Through its activity as a component of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) complex, which forms upon binding with cyclin T1, CDK9 regulates the transcription of genes associated with cell growth, differentiation, and viral pathogenesis (asamitsu2022identificationofa pages 2-4). The kinase also phosphorylates additional substrates such as DSIF, NELF, and transcription factors including MYOD1 and EP300, which in turn contribute to mRNA processing, histone modification, and chromatin remodeling (asamitsu2022identificationofa pages 14-15, candolfi2014roleofcdk9 pages 82-85). CDK9’s role in controlling cytokine-inducible transcription networks further implicates it in the regulation of signaling pathways such as TNF-inducible RELA/p65 and IL-6-inducible STAT3, thereby integrating extracellular signals with transcriptional responses (asamitsu2022identificationofa pages 1-2). Its activity is not only central to normal cellular transcription but also contributes to oncogenic processes and viral replication, particularly in the context of HIV, where CDK9 is hijacked by the HIV Tat protein to promote viral gene expression (asamitsu2022identificationofa pages 11-13, ksionsko2024mechanisticcharacterizationof pages 108-110).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral small molecule inhibitors have been developed targeting CDK9, including compounds that bind the ATP-binding site and those that exploit the unique hidden cavity induced by Tat binding; examples include flavopiridol and other novel inhibitors currently under clinical evaluation for cancer and viral infections (asamitsu2022identificationofa pages 6-9, ksionsko2024mechanisticcharacterizationof pages 115-117). CDK9 is also implicated in replication stress responses and genome integrity maintenance, where its kinase activity helps to limit the accumulation of single-stranded DNA under replication arrest conditions (candolfi2014roleofcdk9 pages 17-21). Disease associations for CDK9 prominently include various cancers, especially hematologic malignancies such as T-cell lymphomas, and viral infections where its role in transcription is exploited by pathogens like HIV (ksionsko2024mechanisticcharacterizationof pages 117-120, asamitsu2022identificationofa pages 1-2). In addition, the CDK9/cyclin-K complex can substitute for the canonical CDK9/cyclin-T P-TEFb in vitro, broadening the functional repertoire of CDK9 and its importance in coordinated transcriptional regulation and potentially DNA repair processes (asamitsu2022identificationofa pages 14-15, candolfi2014roleofcdk9 pages 21-28).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nCyclin‐dependent kinase 10 (CDK10, gene: CDK10, UniProt: Q15131) is a member of the cyclin‐dependent kinase family that belongs to the CMGC group of kinases, a subgroup of the eukaryotic protein kinome conserved from yeast to mammals, although a yeast homologue is notably absent for CDK10 (duster2021biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 116-118). In evolutionary terms, CDK10 clusters with other transcription‐related CDKs and is phylogenetically more related to kinases such as CDK11 than to the classical cell cycle CDKs (e.g., CDK1, CDK2) (guen2013cdk10cyclinmis pages 1-1, guen2017theawakeningof pages 1-2). Its evolutionary origin can be traced to the expansion of the CDK family in metazoans, and its partnership with Cyclin M (also known as Cyclin Q; gene FAM58A) is conserved among higher organisms, highlighting an evolutionarily conserved regulatory module that is part of an ancient cell regulatory machinery (duster2021biochemicalcharacterizationofa pages 23-28, łukasik2021cyclindependentkinases(cdk) pages 5-7). Moreover, when compared with the global kinome described by Manning and co-workers, CDK10 falls into a subset of kinases with roles in transcription, reinforcing its distinct evolutionary trajectory from purely cell cycle‐regulatory kinases (Manning2002, Manning2002).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK10 catalyzes the transfer of a γ-phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl side chain of serine or threonine residues in target proteins. The chemical reaction can be summarized as: ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (duster2021biochemicalcharacterizationofa pages 86-89). This classical serine/threonine phosphorylation reaction is typical of members of the CDK family (colas2020cyclindependentkinasesand pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of CDK10 depends on the presence of ATP as the phosphate donor and requires magnesium ions (Mg²⁺) as an essential cofactor for catalysis (duster2021biochemicalcharacterizationofa pages 86-89). Mg²⁺ coordinates ATP binding in the active site and assists in proper orientation for effective phosphoryl transfer to the target substrates (duster2021biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 33-37).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCDK10 exhibits substrate specificity that is in line with many serine/threonine kinases, primarily targeting serine/threonine residues that are followed by a proline residue in the substrate sequence. In vitro studies have demonstrated that CDK10 phosphorylates the transcription factor ETS2 on adjacent serine residues, leading to its proteasomal degradation (guen2013cdk10cyclinmis pages 1-2, bazzi2021cdk10ingastrointestinal pages 1-2). Furthermore, CDK10 phosphorylates regulators of actin cytoskeleton organization such as PKN2, thereby influencing actin dynamics and negatively regulating ciliogenesis through the modulation of RhoA signaling (bazzi2021cdk10ingastrointestinal pages 1-2, duster2021biochemicalcharacterizationofa pages 15-18). In addition to ETS2 and PKN2, CDK10 has been shown to modify other substrates including segments of the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain (CTD) and the proto-oncogene c-Myc, with biochemical assays indicating a modest preference for the phosphorylation of serine residues within (S/T)P motifs (duster2021biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 89-93, guen2017theawakeningof pages 2-3). According to recent high-throughput kinase substrate profiling, such as that presented by Johnson et al. (2023), serine/threonine kinases frequently display substrate motifs enriched in basic residues at defined positions relative to the phosphoacceptor; thus, CDK10 is thought to share a consensus that is centered on a minimal (S/T)P motif with preferential flanking sequences that enhance its catalytic efficiency (Johnson2023). This pattern contrasts with tyrosine kinases whose intrinsic substrate recognition preferences have been separately characterized (Yaron-Barir2024).\n\n5. Structure  \nCDK10 is a 360 amino acid protein characterized by the canonical bilobal structure of eukaryotic protein kinases, comprising an N-terminal lobe mainly involved in ATP binding and a larger C-terminal lobe that is primarily responsible for substrate recognition (duster2021biochemicalcharacterizationofa pages 86-89). A notable structural feature of CDK10 is its modified cyclin interaction motif “PISSLRE,” which is a variant of the canonical PSTAIRE motif found in other CDKs; this modification is essential for its specific interaction with Cyclin M (duster2021biochemicalcharacterizationofa pages 86-89, guen2013cdk10cyclinmis pages 1-2). Within the kinase domain, the catalytic loop contains a critical aspartate residue (Asp163) that acts as a proton acceptor during phosphoryl transfer, and mutation of this residue (e.g., D163N) abolishes catalytic activity, underscoring its central role in the enzyme’s function (duster2021biochemicalcharacterizationofa pages 86-89). In addition to the catalytic loop, the activation segment or T-loop contains a key threonine residue (Thr196) whose phosphorylation is required for full activation of CDK10, although the upstream kinase responsible for this modification has not been definitively identified (duster2021biochemicalcharacterizationofa pages 86-89). CDK10 also possesses a bipartite nuclear localization signal located at its C-terminus, a feature that directs the enzyme—or more specifically, the CDK10/Cyclin M complex—to the nucleus where many of its substrates are localized (duster2021biochemicalcharacterizationofa pages 86-89, duster2021biochemicalcharacterizationofa pages 11-15). Cyclin M, the activating subunit of CDK10, is a relatively small protein of approximately 248 amino acids that contains two cyclin box domains. Although Cyclin M lacks an intrinsic nuclear localization signal, its stable binding to CDK10 is essential for the correct subcellular distribution and catalytic competence of the complex (guen2013cdk10cyclinmis pages 1-2, duster2021biochemicalcharacterizationofa pages 33-37). Despite the absence of a high-resolution crystal structure for the CDK10/Cyclin M complex, biochemical and biophysical studies, including those employing fusion proteins and mutagenesis strategies, have provided a clear view of the overall domain organization and the key catalytic and regulatory features that govern CDK10 function (duster2021biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 33-37, sun2005homologymodelingand pages 1-2).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe activity of CDK10 is principally regulated through its association with Cyclin M, which is required for its catalytic activity; CDK10 alone is catalytically inactive (guen2013cdk10cyclinmis pages 1-2, duster2021biochemicalcharacterizationofa pages 15-18). Phosphorylation plays a critical role in modulating CDK10 function: phosphorylation at threonine 196 within the activation loop is necessary for full catalytic activity, while additional phosphorylation events, such as those occurring at serine 351 when co-expressed with Cyclin M, may contribute to regulation of protein–protein interactions or stability (duster2021biochemicalcharacterizationofa pages 86-89, duster2021biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 33-37). In cellular contexts, CDK10 activity is further modulated by the proteasomal degradation pathways; for example, phosphorylation of its substrate ETS2 by the CDK10/Cyclin M complex facilitates subsequent ubiquitin-dependent degradation of ETS2 (guen2013cdk10cyclinmis pages 5-6). This process not only regulates the level of ETS2 but also influences downstream signaling cascades such as MAPK signaling (bazzi2021cdk10ingastrointestinal pages 1-2). In addition, regulatory mechanisms such as interactions with other factors (e.g., HSP90 and possibly the prolyl isomerase Pin1) may influence CDK10 stability and function, although the precise details of these interactions require further elucidation (duster2021biochemicalcharacterizationofa pages 112-116). Overall, the principal regulatory features of CDK10 include its dependency on Cyclin M for activation, the requirement for activating phosphorylation events on the T-loop (Thr196), and its ability to modulate substrate stability through phosphorylation-dependent degradation pathways (guen2013cdk10cyclinmis pages 5-6, guen2017theawakeningof pages 4-6).\n\n7. Function  \nCDK10 exerts a multifaceted role in cellular function primarily through its kinase activity, which directs the phosphorylation of key regulatory proteins. One of the primary substrates of CDK10 is the ETS2 transcription factor; phosphorylation of ETS2 by CDK10 promotes its proteasomal degradation, thereby negatively regulating ETS2-dependent transcriptional programs and influencing downstream signaling pathways such as the MAPK cascade (bazzi2021cdk10ingastrointestinal pages 1-2, guen2013cdk10cyclinmis pages 5-6). In addition, CDK10 phosphorylates actin dynamics regulators, such as protein kinase N2 (PKN2), thereby participating in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton organization. This activity is linked to its role as a negative regulator of ciliogenesis because phosphorylation of PKN2 by the CDK10/Cyclin M complex promotes RhoA signaling, which in turn represses both the assembly and elongation of primary cilia (bazzi2021cdk10ingastrointestinal pages 1-2, duster2021biochemicalcharacterizationofa pages 15-18). Furthermore, CDK10 has been implicated in transcriptional regulation beyond its action on ETS2; substrates such as RNA polymerase II CTD and the oncoprotein c-Myc have been identified in biochemical assays, suggesting that CDK10 modulates processes related to gene expression and cell proliferation (duster2021biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 89-93, guen2017theawakeningof pages 2-3). CDK10 is expressed in several tissues and cell types, and its expression levels have been correlated with clinical parameters in gastrointestinal cancers where it may function either as a tumor suppressor or, in certain contexts, as an oncogene (bazzi2021cdk10ingastrointestinal pages 1-2, duster2022functionalcharacterizationof pages 1-2). In breast cancer cells, reduced expression of CDK10 is associated with tamoxifen resistance, highlighting its importance in hormone-dependent signaling pathways and therapeutic response (guen2013cdk10cyclinmis pages 5-6, guen2017theawakeningof pages 4-6). Thus, the functional repertoire of CDK10 encompasses regulation of transcription factor turnover, modulation of cytoskeletal dynamics, and control of cell cycle progression, all of which contribute to its roles in development and disease (robert2021functionalcharacterizationof pages 1-2).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral experimental inhibitors developed for related CDKs have shown inhibitory activity against CDK10, although no inhibitor specific to CDK10 is yet approved for clinical use. ATP-competitive inhibitors such as Flavopiridol, Dinaciclib, and NVP-2 have been reported to inhibit CDK10 activity in biochemical assays; in particular, NVP-2 displays potent inhibition and shares overlapping inhibitor profiles with CDK9 (duster2021biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 93-97, robert2020developmentofa pages 10-10). In addition, recent high-throughput screening assays, including the homogeneous miniaturized kinase assay developed by Robert et al. (2020), have enabled the identification of first-generation small-molecule inhibitors targeting the CDK10/Cyclin M complex (robert2020developmentofa pages 1-2). CDK10 dysfunction is also implicated in developmental disorders; mutations affecting Cyclin M (FAM58A) that disrupt CDK10 complex formation are causative for STAR syndrome, an X-linked developmental disorder characterized by syndactyly, telecanthus, and renal malformations (guen2013cdk10cyclinmis pages 5-6, guen2017theawakeningof pages 7-8). Beyond developmental syndromes, altered CDK10 expression levels have been associated with cancer progression. For instance, reduced CDK10 expression in breast cancer cells correlates with increased ETS2 stability and enhanced MAPK signaling, contributing to drug resistance and poorer clinical outcomes (bazzi2021cdk10ingastrointestinal pages 1-2, guen2017theawakeningof pages 7-8). Future research may further clarify the kinase’s structure–function relationships and facilitate the development of more selective inhibitors that could be used to modulate its activity in disease contexts. Additionally, recent substrate specificity profiling efforts, as exemplified by studies on the human serine/threonine kinome (Johnson2023) and the human tyrosine kinome (Yaron-Barir2024), provide a framework that may be analogous for CDK10, emphasizing its preference for (S/T)P motifs and reinforcing its classification within the serine/threonine kinase category.\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nCyclin‐dependent kinase 14 (CDK14), also known as KIAA0834 or PFTK1, is a member of the cyclin‐dependent kinase family that falls within the CMGC group of the human kinome. CDK14 is evolutionarily conserved among metazoans, and orthologs have been detected from invertebrate species such as Drosophila to mammals, underscoring that this kinase subfamily emerged in an early ancestor of metazoans and has retained its role in the control of cell division over evolutionary time (bradley2019evolutionofprotein pages 1-2, briedis2008thedistributionand pages 205-208). Classic studies on the kinase complement of the human genome have established that CDK14, together with other members of the PFTAIRE subfamily, diverged early from the canonical cyclin‐dependent kinases; these kinases maintain conserved catalytic domains and cyclin-binding regions that are essential for their function in cell cycle regulation (krupa2002therepertoireof pages 2-3, bradley2019evolutionofprotein pages 19-21). In addition, subsequent analyses have demonstrated that CDK14 clusters with related PFTAIRE kinases, sharing significant sequence conservation within the kinase core that is indicative of their common origin and functional similarity in mediating phosphorylation events necessary for cell proliferation and developmental signaling (Manning et al. 2002, Manning et al. 2002, bradley2019evolutionofprotein pages 21-22). Thus, CDK14 is assigned to the CMGC group and more specifically to the cyclin‐dependent kinases that regulate cell cycle progression as well as transcription, and its tight conservation suggests a crucial role in eukaryotic biology (briedis2008thedistributionand pages 205-208).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK14 catalyzes the ATP‐dependent phosphorylation reaction that transfers the gamma‐phosphate group from ATP to serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins. The chemical reaction can be summarized as:  \n  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺  \nThis phosphotransfer reaction represents the fundamental enzymatic activity that defines serine/threonine kinases and enables CDK14 to modulate downstream signaling pathways through the reversible phosphorylation of target proteins (bradley2019evolutionofprotein pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of CDK14 is dependent on divalent metal ions, predominantly Mg²⁺, which are required to coordinate the binding of ATP in the active site of the enzyme. The presence of Mg²⁺ not only stabilizes the nucleotide but also facilitates the precise positioning of the gamma‐phosphate group for transfer to the substrate’s serine or threonine residue. This requirement for Mg²⁺ is a common characteristic of serine/threonine protein kinases and is critical for effective phosphoryl transfer during catalysis (bradley2019evolutionofprotein pages 21-22, kostich2002humanmembersof pages 11-12).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nThe substrate specificity of CDK14 is defined by its ability to recognize serine/threonine phosphorylation sites within specific amino acid motifs. Data from the comprehensive atlas of substrate specificities for the human serine/threonine kinome indicate that CDK family kinases typically prefer proline‐directed motifs, meaning that a phosphorylatable serine or threonine residue is frequently positioned immediately upstream of a proline residue. In the context of CDK14, one experimentally validated target is the Wnt pathway co‐receptor LRP6, which is phosphorylated by CDK14 at Ser-1490—a modification that is consistent with a [S/T]P motif. Although an exact consensus sequence solely for CDK14 has not been fully delineated, its assignment to the cyclin‐dependent kinase family strongly suggests that the recognition pattern incorporates not only the proline adjacent to the phosphoacceptor but also additional flanking residues that may include basic amino acids or other determinants that help direct substrate binding (johnson2023anatlasof pages 10-11, alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 114-118, alrawi2023cyclinaand pages 13-15). Moreover, additional studies indicate that substrate specificity in related kinases is further refined by the interaction with activating cyclins that contribute to conformational changes in the active site, thus enhancing the selectivity for substrates that display the characteristic proline-directed amino acid pattern (johnson2023anatlasof pages 6-7, bradley2019evolutionofprotein pages 21-22).\n\n5. Structure  \nCDK14 exhibits a canonical protein kinase structure that is typical of cyclin‐dependent kinases. The enzyme is characterized by a central kinase domain of approximately 250–300 amino acids that is partitioned into an N-terminal lobe and a larger C-terminal lobe. The N-terminal lobe is mainly composed of β-sheets and houses the glycine-rich loop, which plays a critical role in ATP binding. In contrast, the C-terminal lobe is predominantly α-helical and contains key catalytic elements including the catalytic loop, the activation loop (often referred to as the T-loop), and the C-helix. The activation loop is particularly important as it undergoes conformational changes upon phosphorylation and cyclin binding, thereby acting as a molecular switch that modulates access to the active site (faezov2023alphafold2modelsof pages 1-4, johnson2023anatlasof pages 4-5).  \n\nA defining structural feature of CDK14 is its hydrophobic spine, a series of conserved hydrophobic residues that stabilize the active conformation of the enzyme. In addition, the C-helix within the C-terminal lobe is oriented such that, upon proper cyclin interaction, it forms a critical salt bridge with a conserved lysine residue in the ATP-binding pocket. This alignment of the catalytic residues is essential for efficient phosphoryl transfer during the catalytic cycle (scheeff2005structuralevolutionof pages 10-11, kostich2002humanmembersof pages 4-5).  \n\nFurthermore, CDK14 contains a conserved cyclin-binding domain, which is responsible for its interaction with regulatory cyclins such as cyclin D3 (CCDN3) and, in some studies, cyclin Y. The binding of these cyclins induces conformational rearrangements that are necessary for the full activation of the kinase. Structural predictions from recent AlphaFold2 models have reinforced the notion that CDK14 adopts a typical CDK fold, complete with the expected catalytic cleft, activation segment, and regulatory regions, even though a dedicated high-resolution crystal structure for CDK14 has not yet been published (faezov2023alphafold2modelsof pages 20-23, faezov2023alphafold2modelsof pages 23-25).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulatory mechanisms governing CDK14 activity are intrinsically linked to its association with cyclins and post-translational modifications. The binding of cyclin D3 (CCDN3) is essential for CDK14 activation, as cyclin association induces conformational changes that properly orient the activation loop and catalytic residues, thereby facilitating efficient substrate phosphorylation. In several studies, cyclin Y has also been implicated as an activating partner, providing further evidence of the versatility in cyclin-mediated regulation of CDK14 (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 114-118, alrawi2023cyclinaand pages 32-35).  \n\nPost-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, play a pivotal role in modulating the activity of CDK14. Although specific phosphorylation sites within the activation loop of CDK14 are still under investigation, the regulatory paradigm mirrors that of other CDKs wherein phosphorylation acts as a switch that transitions the kinase from an inactive to an active state. In addition to phosphorylation, there is the potential for regulation through protein–protein interactions and ubiquitination events that may impact protein stability and turnover during distinct phases of the cell cycle (alrawi2023cyclinaand pages 17-20, reinhardt2023acriticalevaluation pages 22-23).  \n\nFurthermore, interactions with 14-3-3 proteins have been reported to influence the binding of cyclins, particularly with cyclin Y; such interactions are thought to enhance complex formation and may also affect the subcellular localization of the CDK14-cyclin complex, thereby fine-tuning the kinase’s activity in response to cellular signals (mikolcevic2012orphankinasesturn pages 2-3, alrawi2023cyclinaand pages 6-8). Collectively, these regulatory mechanisms ensure that CDK14 activity is precisely modulated in time and space during the progression of the cell cycle.\n\n7. Function  \nCDK14 functions primarily as a serine/threonine–protein kinase that plays a significant role in the control of the eukaryotic cell cycle. One of its well-documented functions includes the phosphorylation of the Wnt co-receptor LRP6 at Ser-1490 during the G2/M phase, an event that is critical for the activation of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling. This phosphorylation event contributes to the regulation of cell proliferation and developmental processes (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 114-118, alrawi2023cyclinaand pages 32-35).  \n\nIn addition to modulating Wnt signaling, CDK14 interacts with cyclin D3 (CCDN3) to regulate cell cycle progression. In vitro studies have demonstrated that CDK14 is capable of phosphorylating the retinoblastoma protein (RB1), although the physiological relevance of this phosphoregulation in vivo remains to be conclusively established. Beyond its roles in cell cycle control, emerging evidence suggests that CDK14 may also participate in other cellular processes such as meiosis and neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, there is data indicating that CDK14 can indirectly modulate insulin-responsive glucose transport, adding a possible metabolic dimension to its functional repertoire (briedis2008thedistributionand pages 205-208, kostich2002humanmembersof pages 11-12).  \n\nExpression studies have shown that CDK14 is present in a variety of proliferative tissues, including those of the nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, and reproductive organs. The ubiquitous as well as tissue-specific expression pattern of CDK14 supports its critical role in coordinating cell division and signal transduction processes. By integrating signals from both cyclin partners and upstream regulatory pathways, CDK14 acts as a nodal point that influences not only cell cycle transitions but also the broader network of pathways that govern cell proliferation and differentiation (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 114-118, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 1-2).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nAlthough numerous inhibitors targeting members of the cyclin-dependent kinase family have been developed, there remains a lack of highly selective and clinically approved inhibitors specific for CDK14. Some covalent inhibitors designed against the broader TAIRE subfamily of CDKs exhibit activity against CDK14; however, these compounds typically show pan-TAIRE specificity and thus inhibit related kinases, complicating assessments of selectivity. As such, CDK14 currently represents an attractive candidate for further drug discovery research aimed at developing selective inhibitors (ferguson2019discoveryofcovalent pages 12-13, poll2024aresourcedatabase pages 6-9).  \n\nIn terms of disease association, dysregulation of CDK14 has been implicated in aberrant cell cycle control and dysregulated Wnt signaling pathways—features that are commonly observed in various types of cancer. While specific disease mutations and their direct functional consequences remain to be extensively characterized, overexpression or hyperactivation of CDK14 has been observed in multiple tumor types, suggesting potential links to oncogenic processes. Continued research into the regulation and substrate interactions of CDK14 may eventually establish its utility as a therapeutic target in proliferative disorders and other pathological conditions (krupa2002therepertoireof pages 2-3, alrawi2023cyclinaand pages 32-35).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny:**  \nCyclin‐dependent kinase 15 (CDK15), also referred to as PFTK2 or ALS2CR7, is a member of the cyclin‐dependent kinase family within the CMGC group of serine/threonine kinases. Comparative studies of the human kinome indicate that CDK15 shares the highly conserved catalytic core that is a signature of all CDKs. Sequence alignments and domain analyses show that CDK15 clusters with the atypical CDKs, specifically grouping members in the PFTAIRE subgroup alongside CDK14. This subgroup is defined by a conserved PFTAIRE motif that is present in the cyclin binding region, and the evolutionary divergence seen in these regions likely reflects differences in regulatory interactions among family members. Orthologs of CDK15 have been identified in a broad range of vertebrate species, supporting its ancient evolutionary origin that predates the divergence of modern vertebrates. This conservation across species highlights the preservation of its catalytic mechanisms while allowing specialized functions to emerge. Moreover, the evolutionary lineage of CDK15 is distinct from that of the canonical cell cycle regulators (for example, CDK1 and CDK2), suggesting that while it retains the critical structural motifs characteristic of CDKs, it has evolved additional or alternative roles such as involvement in apoptotic signaling pathways. (amrhein2022discoveryof3amino1hpyrazolebased pages 28-30, johnson2023anatlasof pages 1-2, karimbayli2022dissectingtherole pages 16-19, karimbayli2022dissectingtherolea pages 16-19, kamkar2015pftaire1(cyclindependent pages 24-29)\n\nThe phylogenetic placement of CDK15 within the atypical CDKs indicates that, despite its shared ancestry with cell cycle–regulating CDKs, it has undergone evolutionary refinement that distinguishes its biological role. These sequence comparisons underscore that while the core catalytic domain is maintained, regions responsible for cyclin interactions and substrate specificity are variable. Such divergence is common among kinases that have adopted more specialized cellular functions. Therefore, CDK15 is conserved through vertebrate evolution and is clearly segregated in the human kinome into a subgroup that is associated with more specialized regulatory processes, such as modulating apoptosis rather than driving cell cycle transitions. (johnson2023anatlasof pages 1-2)\n\n**2. Reaction Catalyzed:**  \nCDK15 catalyzes an ATP‐dependent phosphorylation reaction that is a hallmark of serine/threonine protein kinases. The enzyme mediates the transfer of the γ‐phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues on its protein substrates. Expressed in a succinct chemical equation, this reaction is:  \n\n  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺.  \n\nThis reaction underpins the modification of substrate proteins, converting them into their active or functionally distinct phosphorylated forms. Such phosphorylation events are crucial for the propagation and regulation of downstream signaling cascades, ensuring precise control of cellular responses. In the case of CDK15, this catalytic mechanism is employed to regulate antiapoptotic processes by modifying key substrates. (amrhein2022discoveryof3amino1hpyrazolebased pages 28-30, johnson2023anatlasof pages 1-2, bradley2019evolutionofprotein pages 1-2)\n\n**3. Cofactor Requirements:**  \nThe kinase activity of CDK15 is strictly dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions, with Mg²⁺ serving as the principal cofactor. Mg²⁺ interacts directly with ATP in the active site of CDK15, effectively stabilizing the negative charges on the phosphate groups and facilitating the nucleophilic attack required for phosphoryl transfer. This stabilization is a necessary step in achieving an energetically favorable transition state during the catalytic process. In serine/threonine kinases such as CDK15, the dependence on Mg²⁺ is a well-accepted requirement, and no evidence suggests that alternative metal ions (such as Mn²⁺ or Ca²⁺) substitute with comparable efficiency in this enzymatic reaction. The specificity for Mg²⁺ is thus an integral component of CDK15’s mechanism of phosphoryl group transfer. (amrhein2022discoveryof3amino1hpyrazolebased pages 28-30, east2024quantitativeproteomicmass pages 3-4, johnson2023anatlasof pages 1-2)\n\n**4. Substrate Specificity:**  \nDetailed substrate specificity profiling using comprehensive peptide library assays has demonstrated that CDK15 displays substrate preferences that mirror those observed in numerous cyclin‐dependent kinases. In particular, CDK15 preferentially phosphorylates serine or threonine residues when these amino acids are immediately followed by a proline residue, a feature that is characteristic of proline-directed kinases. Thus, the enriched consensus motif is expected to be an S/T-P motif, which forms the minimal element for recognition. However, additional flanking sequences may influence binding efficacy and contribute to the overall substrate fidelity observed in CDK15 activity. Empirical evidence further supports that CDK15 phosphorylates BIRC5 (Survivin) specifically at threonine 34—an event that is critical for its role in modulating apoptotic signaling pathways. Computational motif analyses and scoring matrices generated from large-scale substrate specificity atlases indicate that several substrate determinants besides the minimal S/T-P motif exist, contributing to optimal substrate interaction. These analyses suggest that recognition by CDK15 is governed by conserved active site residues that not only prefer a proline in the +1 position but may also involve additional positive or negative selection residues within the neighborhood of the phosphorylation site. The substrate specificity for CDK15 is, therefore, a composite of a primary proline-directed motif with additional sequence determinants that enhance substrate selectivity. (johnson2023anatlasof pages 1-2, johnson2023anatlasof pages 7-7, karimbayli2022dissectingtherole pages 16-19, jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 22-24, bradley2019evolutionofprotein pages 15-16, essegian2022datadrivencomputational pages 30-34)\n\n**5. Structure:**  \nThe three-dimensional structure of CDK15 conforms to the canonical architecture typical of cyclin‐dependent kinases. The central feature is a conserved protein kinase domain, which is predicted to adopt a bilobal configuration. The N-terminal lobe is composed largely of β-sheets, while the C-terminal lobe predominantly contains α-helices. These two lobes come together to form a catalytic cleft that houses the ATP-binding pocket, an essential element for catalysis. Within this domain, several key motifs have been identified based on sequence conservation and computational modeling.  \nOne critical element is the DFG motif located at the start of the activation loop; this motif plays a decisive role in coordinating the Mg²⁺ ion and positioning ATP for phosphoryl transfer. Similarly, a catalytic aspartate residue, located in the catalytic loop, is indispensable for transferring the phosphate group from ATP to the substrate. The C-helix in the N-terminal lobe is another vital structural element, responsible for the proper alignment of catalytic residues and stabilization of the kinase’s active conformation. The activation or T-loop, which is a flexible segment within the kinase domain, undergoes phosphorylation-induced conformational changes that switch the enzyme from an inactive to an active state. Although no crystal structure specific to CDK15 has yet been published, state-of-the-art models, such as those rendered by AlphaFold, predict a structure consistent with the established CDK fold.  \nAdditionally, CDK15 possesses N- and C-terminal extensions that deviate from the conserved kinase core. These terminal regions are less conserved among the CDKs and may be involved in mediating protein–protein interactions or dictating subcellular localization. While the precise functional contributions of these extensions remain to be comprehensively characterized, they might provide interaction surfaces for potential regulatory partners. Overall, the structural model of CDK15 highlights a well-organized kinase domain with all the canonical features required for ATP binding and phosphoryl transfer, interspersed with variable regions that may confer regulatory specificity or subcellular targeting. (johnson2023anatlasof pages 7-7, bradley2019evolutionofprotein pages 9-11, east2024quantitativeproteomicmass pages 3-4, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 6-7, kamkar2015pftaire1(cyclindependent pages 24-29)\n\n**6. Regulation:**  \nRegulatory control of CDK15 is achieved by mechanisms that are common among cyclin‐dependent kinases. Central to its regulation are post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation within the activation loop. The phosphorylation of residues in this region is known to induce conformational shifts that enable the full catalytic activity of the enzyme, a paradigm well-documented in other CDKs. While the specific cyclin partner(s) for CDK15 have not been definitively identified, its classification within the CDK family suggests that cyclin binding is likely an essential regulatory event. In many CDKs, cyclin association serves both as a mechanism for substrate recruitment and as an allosteric activator that stabilizes the active conformation of the catalytic domain.  \nAdditional layers of regulation may include ubiquitination, which could affect the stability and turnover of CDK15, although direct experimental evidence for such modification in CDK15 remains limited. Moreover, potential allosteric regulators might exist that influence its kinetic parameters or substrate specificity, as seen with other kinases; however, these regulatory modes have not been firmly established for CDK15. An important aspect of CDK15 regulation is its role in promoting cell survival via the phosphorylation of BIRC5 (Survivin) at threonine 34. This modification is directly linked to its antiapoptotic function, indicating that the precise control of CDK15’s activity is integrated into the broader apoptotic signaling network. Maintaining the proper phosphorylation state of both CDK15 and its substrate is therefore pivotal in deciding cell fate, particularly in conditions where TRAIL/TNFSF10-induced apoptosis is a factor. In summary, the regulation of CDK15 likely involves activation through T-loop phosphorylation and possibly cyclin binding, with additional post-translational modifications contributing to its fine-tuned control. (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 6-7, bradley2019evolutionofprotein pages 11-12, karimbayli2022dissectingtheroleb pages 16-19, amrhein2022discoveryof3amino1hpyrazolebased pages 28-30, jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 20-22)\n\n**7. Function:**  \nCDK15 functions as a serine/threonine protein kinase with a critical role in the regulation of apoptotic signaling. Its primary functional activity is to phosphorylate the inhibitor of apoptosis protein BIRC5 (Survivin) specifically at threonine 34. This modification is integral to CDK15’s antiapoptotic function, as it stabilizes Survivin by preventing its proteolytic degradation. By doing so, CDK15 counteracts signals that would otherwise lead to the activation of caspases and the execution of apoptosis, particularly in response to TRAIL/TNFSF10 stimulation.  \nThe impact of CDK15 activity on cell survival has implications in a variety of cellular contexts. Expression analyses, although not entirely comprehensive, have indicated that CDK15 is expressed in multiple tissues; there is evidence to suggest that its expression may be relatively higher in neural tissues, which aligns with its alternative designation as ALS2CR7. This elevated expression in specific tissues may reflect a specialized role in protecting differentiated cells from apoptotic stress. Beyond its antiapoptotic activity, CDK15 is also implicated in broader signaling networks that govern cell cycle regulation and transcription, although its precise role in these processes remains less well defined compared to canonical CDKs involved in cell cycle progression. Overall, CDK15 occupies an important niche in the intracellular decision-making processes that balance survival and programmed cell death, primarily by modulating the phosphorylation state of key substrates like Survivin. (amrhein2022discoveryof3amino1hpyrazolebased pages 28-30, johnson2023anatlasof pages 1-2, karimbayli2022dissectingtherole pages 16-19, colas2020cyclindependentkinasesand pages 1-2, gopinathan2011establishedandnovel pages 1-4)\n\n**8. Other Comments:**  \nCDK15 is known under several alternative names, including Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 2 chromosomal region candidate gene 7 protein, Cell division protein kinase 15, and Serine/threonine-protein kinase PFTAIRE-2, each reflecting its varied historical discovery and functional characterizations. Despite extensive research into the antiapoptotic mechanisms that involve Survivin phosphorylation, selective inhibitors targeting CDK15 specifically are not yet available. Broad-spectrum CDK inhibitors may affect CDK15 activity unintentionally; however, the development of compounds with high specificity for CDK15 remains an important objective. Moreover, while the antiapoptotic role of CDK15 is well documented, disease associations—particularly its potential links with neurodegenerative disorders (indicated by the ALS2CR7 nomenclature) or oncogenic pathways—have not been conclusively established through genetic mutation studies. The current literature underscores that there is a significant gap in understanding the detailed regulation, cellular interacting partners, and complete repertoire of substrates for CDK15. Continued research employing high-throughput proteomics, structural modeling, and rational inhibitor design is anticipated to further elucidate these aspects and potentially reveal new therapeutic avenues.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nCyclin‐dependent kinase 16 (CDK16), also known as PCTAIRE1 or PCTK1, is a member of the PCTAIRE subfamily of cyclin‐dependent kinases, a group that is evolutionarily conserved across eumetazoans. Within the human kinome, CDK16 is grouped with related kinases CDK17 and CDK18, and it shows significant sequence similarity in the kinase domain to other CDKs such as CDK2 and CDK5. Based on the analyses by Manning et al. (2002) describing the protein kinase complement of the human genome and the evolutionary trajectory from yeast to mammals, CDK16 belongs to the CMGC group of serine/threonine kinases. Its orthologs are present in all mammalian species and more broadly in metazoans, while its unique PCTAIRE motif in the αC-helix distinguishes it from classical cell cycle regulators. This phylogenetic context underscores its placement in an evolutionary “core” set of kinases that emerged early in eukaryotic evolution, a set that includes not only members of the cell cycle machinery but also kinases with specialized functions in post-mitotic tissues such as the brain and testis (Manning2002Science, Manning2002Trends; karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 1-2, mikolcevic2012orphankinasesturn pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK16 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to hydroxyl groups on serine or threonine residues in proteins. The canonical reaction can be represented as:  \n  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺  \nThis reaction is typical of serine/threonine kinases in the cyclin-dependent kinase family and aligns with the reaction mechanisms described for related kinases (dixon2015structureandinhibition pages 23-28).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of CDK16 is dependent upon the presence of divalent metal ions such as Mg²⁺, which are essential for coordinating ATP within the active site and enabling efficient phosphate transfer. In biochemical assays, Mg²⁺ (and in some instances Mn²⁺ as an alternative cofactor) is required to facilitate the kinase activity of CDK16, consistent with the cofactor dependencies reported for many CDK family members (dixon2015structureandinhibition pages 43-45, endicott2013structuralcharacterizationof pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCDK16 is a serine/threonine kinase with substrate specificity generally aligned with the proline-directed phosphorylation pattern typical of CDKs. In particular, CDK16 can phosphorylate substrates that carry specific sequence motifs, although the exact consensus motif for CDK16 has not been fully elucidated. Experimentally, CDK16 phosphorylates substrates such as the N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor (NSF), thereby regulating NSF oligomerization, and has been shown in vitro to phosphorylate cyclin Y at serine 336. In broader studies focusing on serine/threonine kinase substrate preferences, an atlas has been constructed that details the intrinsic specificity of many such kinases, where substrates typically exhibit a preference for a serine or threonine residue immediately followed by a proline. Additional insights also come from studies examining the intrinsic substrate specificity of tyrosine kinases, which, although not directly applied to CDK16, help establish the context of kinase substrate discrimination within the kinome; however, CDK16 remains defined as a serine/threonine kinase (Johnson2023Atlas pages 759-766, Yaron-Barir2024Atlas pages 1174-1181, xie2018cdk16phosphorylatesand pages 9-13).\n\n5. Structure  \nCDK16 contains a centrally located kinase domain that is characteristic of the CDK family, flanked by distinctive N-terminal and C-terminal extensions. The kinase domain itself comprises the typical bilobal fold with an N-terminal lobe consisting mainly of β-sheets and a glycine-rich loop, and a larger C-terminal lobe that is predominantly α-helical. Key structural features include the DFG motif, which coordinates Mg²⁺ ions necessary for catalytic activity, and the PCTAIRE motif located within the αC-helix, which distinguishes CDK16 from classical CDKs that generally contain the PSTAIRE sequence. Crystal structures, such as those reported in studies using the inhibitor indirubin E804, reveal that in the absence of cyclin binding, CDK16 adopts an intrinsically inactive conformation with a displaced αC-helix and an activation loop in a “DFG-out” conformation; however, binding of the regulatory partner cyclin Y induces a conformational shift toward an active kinase state, as the cyclin interaction facilitates proper alignment of the catalytic residues (dixon2015structureandinhibition pages 147-151, endicott2013structuralcharacterizationof pages 3-5, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 2-4). In addition, the N-terminal extension harbors regulatory elements including a phosphorylation site at serine 153, which plays a key role in modulating the binding of cyclin Y. The overall three-dimensional organization of CDK16 thus features a conserved catalytic core with unique regulatory appendages that are critical for its isoform-specific interactions and subcellular targeting (mikolcevic2012orphankinasesturn pages 2-3, dixon2015structureandinhibition pages 28-33).\n\n6. Regulation  \nRegulation of CDK16 occurs primarily through its association with cyclin Y, which is essential for kinase activation. In its monomeric form, CDK16 is catalytically inactive, and cyclin binding is required to induce the conformational rearrangements necessary for active substrate phosphorylation. A critical regulatory event is the phosphorylation of CDK16 at serine 153, a residue that is part of a consensus sequence for protein kinase A (PKA). Phosphorylation at this site negatively regulates the interaction between CDK16 and cyclin Y, thereby inhibiting kinase activity. In certain cellular contexts, a decrease in serine 153 phosphorylation permits the formation of an active CDK16–cyclin Y complex; this regulatory mechanism is particularly evident in testicular tissue, where lower levels of phosphorylated serine 153 correlate with active CDK16 required for spermatogenesis (mikolcevic2012orphankinasesturn pages 10-11, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 17-18). Additionally, allosteric regulation through cyclin binding induces rearrangement of the C-helix and the activation loop, facilitating ATP binding and substrate recognition. Other regulatory mechanisms, including interactions with proteins such as 14-3-3 and potential phosphorylation by additional kinases such as CDK5/p35, contribute further to the fine-tuning of CDK16 activity in neuronal cells and during vesicle trafficking events (hernandezortega2019phosphoregulationofthe pages 5-7, janackova2023mechanismusregulacecyklindependentní pages 20-24).\n\n7. Function  \nCDK16 plays diverse roles in cellular physiology that encompass vesicle-mediated transport, exocytosis, and the regulation of hormone release in the brain. One of its critical functions is the phosphorylation of NSF, a key regulatory step in controlling NSF oligomerization. This activity is important for vesicular trafficking and exocytosis in neuronal cells, where CDK16 regulates the release of growth hormone (GH1) by brain neurons. Beyond its role in exocytosis, CDK16 is required for normal spermatogenesis; its activity is crucial in postmeiotic spermatids, and loss of CDK16 function in animal models results in impaired sperm differentiation and fertility defects. CDK16 is also implicated in neuronal differentiation and dendrite development, possibly by modulating components of the cytoskeletal and vesicle trafficking machinery, and it has been associated with the regulation of insulin secretion in pancreatic beta-cells in response to changes in blood glucose levels. In vitro, CDK16 has been shown to phosphorylate cyclin Y at serine 336, further highlighting its capacity to regulate components of its own activation complex (amrhein2022discoveryof3amino1hpyrazolebased pages 1-3, amrhein2022discoveryof3amino1hpyrazolebased pages 3-4, xie2018cdk16phosphorylatesand pages 13-13, li2022cdk16promotesthe pages 18-18, mikolcevic2012cyclindependentkinase16pctaire pages 2-3).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral small-molecule inhibitors have been developed or identified that target CDK16 activity. For instance, selective 3-amino-1H-pyrazole-based compounds have been reported to inhibit CDK16 with high potency; compound 43d is one such inhibitor that has been used to illuminate the biological functions of the PCTAIRE kinase family (amrhein2022discoveryof3amino1hpyrazolebased pages 1-3). Additionally, broader-spectrum kinase inhibitors such as dabrafenib and rebastinib, originally developed for other kinase targets, have been shown to inhibit CDK16 activity in various cellular assays (dixon2015structureandinhibition pages 147-151). CDK16’s involvement in critical processes such as vesicle trafficking, neuronal differentiation, and spermatogenesis, as well as its potential role in the regulation of insulin secretion, makes it an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in disorders ranging from infertility to certain neurodegenerative conditions and metabolic syndromes. However, while the inhibition of CDK16 may offer clinical benefits, the specificity of available inhibitors is a matter of ongoing research, and further work is required to develop compounds that selectively target CDK16 without affecting other cyclin-dependent kinases (pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 17-18, dixon2015structureandinhibition pages 40-43).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nCDK17 (also known as PCTAIRE2 or PCTK2) is a member of the PCTAIRE subfamily of cyclin‐dependent kinases. It is grouped together with related kinases CDK16 (PCTAIRE1) and CDK18 (PCTAIRE3), which share a conserved catalytic domain and unique N‐ and C‐terminal extensions that are less conserved compared to classical cell cycle CDKs. Orthologs of CDK17 are found across eumetazoans and its phylogenetic placement is consistent with the evolution of specialized kinase functions in terminally differentiated tissues, particularly in the nervous system (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 114-118, mikolcevic2012orphankinasesturn pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK17 catalyzes the phosphorylation reaction using ATP as a substrate. The chemical reaction involved is:  \nATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺  \nThis reaction underlies the essential kinase activity observed in serine/threonine protein kinases (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 29-32).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe enzymatic activity of CDK17 is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions. In particular, Mg²⁺ is required as a cofactor to facilitate proper binding of ATP within the catalytic site (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 29-32).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCDK17 exhibits substrate specificity characteristic of proline‐directed serine/threonine kinases. Experimental profiling using high‐throughput peptide substrate phosphorylation assays has demonstrated that the kinase preferentially phosphorylates serine or threonine residues when these residues are immediately followed by a proline in the peptide sequence. This indicates that the consensus phosphorylation motif for CDK17 is defined by (S/T)-P preference, a feature shared with other cyclin‐dependent kinases in the CMGC group (johnson2023anatlasof pages 2-3, johnson2023anatlasof pages 4-4, johnson2023anatlasof pages 7-7).\n\n5. Structure  \nCDK17 contains a central catalytic kinase domain approximating 250 amino acids in length that displays the common bi-lobal architecture observed for CDKs. The N-terminal lobe is predominantly composed of β-sheets and a glycine-rich (G-) loop, whereas the C-terminal lobe is mainly α-helical and includes the activation loop whose conformation is critical for enzymatic activity. A distinctive feature of CDK17 is the replacement of the canonical PSTAIRE motif found in many CDKs by a PCTAIRE sequence in the C-helix, which is important for cyclin binding and dictates part of its functional specificity. Flanking the kinase domain are less conserved N-terminal and C-terminal extensions that are thought to mediate interactions with regulatory partners and may contribute to subcellular localization. Additionally, the kinase domain harbors the conserved HRD and DFG motifs essential for catalysis and has been modeled to share structural similarities with other active forms of CDKs despite limited direct crystallographic data on CDK17 itself (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 32-35, endicott2013structuralcharacterizationof pages 3-5).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of CDK17 involves a combination of cyclin binding, phosphorylation events, and potential interactions with regulatory proteins such as 14-3-3. Although the specific cyclin partner for CDK17 remains less definitively characterized compared to classical cell cycle CDKs, evidence supports that cyclin Y may function in its activation, analogous to observations made for other PCTAIRE kinases. Activation typically requires the formation of a CDK-cyclin complex that induces conformational changes exposing the active site; in the case of CDK17, phosphorylation on key amino acid residues by upstream kinases (including protein kinase A in some cellular contexts) has been noted to modulate its kinase activity and subcellular distribution. Moreover, interaction with 14-3-3 proteins can influence the localization and stability of the kinase, further contributing to its regulatory control in terminally differentiated neurons (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 118-121, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 17-18).\n\n7. Function  \nCDK17 is primarily expressed in terminally differentiated neurons, and its biological role is thought to be distinct from the classical cell cycle regulatory functions of many other CDKs. It has been characterized as a serine/threonine kinase based on its ability to phosphorylate substrates such as histone H1, by similarity to other kinases of the CDK family. The neuronal expression pattern implies a role in neuronal differentiation and possibly in the regulation of chromatin dynamics within post-mitotic cells. Furthermore, although detailed downstream signaling pathways remain to be fully elucidated, CDK17 is implicated in processes intrinsic to neuronal function and may participate in specialized signaling pathways that differ from those governing cell proliferation (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 114-118, johnson2023anatlasof pages 7-7, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 17-18).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSelective inhibitors that exclusively target CDK17 have not yet been comprehensively characterized; existing pan-CDK inhibitors may affect its activity, albeit without established specificity. In addition, although bioinformatic analyses and limited experimental data have linked CDK17 expression with neurodegenerative conditions, particularly given its neuronal enrichment, definitive disease associations and the clinical relevance of CDK17 mutations or dysregulation are still under investigation. Further detailed biochemical studies and high-resolution structural analyses are needed to clarify its precise substrates, inhibitor sensitivity, and the full spectrum of its physiological functions (amrhein2022discoveryof3amino1hpyrazolebased pages 1-3, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 17-17).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nCyclin‐dependent kinase 18 (CDK18), also known as PCTAIRE3 or PCTK3, is a member of the PCTAIRE subfamily of the cyclin‐dependent kinases, which diverged from the classical cell cycle CDKs early in eukaryotic evolution. Its orthologs are found widely in metazoans, and its evolutionary conservation is evident from sequence comparisons that reveal a kinase domain sharing approximately 52–60% identity with related kinases such as CDK16 (PCTAIRE1) and CDK17 (PCTAIRE2) (pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 1-2, cole2009pctkproteinsthe pages 2-4). CDK18 is assigned to the atypical CDK group that does not feature the canonical PSTAIRE motif but instead carries a defining PCTAIRE sequence in its C-helix, a change that is thought to influence its cyclin-binding properties and regulatory interactions (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 6-7, lazzaro1997characterizationofa pages 32-34). This kinase has been phylogenetically linked to other kinases involved both in cell cycle-independent processes (especially those in terminally differentiated cells) and in key signaling cascades, thereby placing it in a distinct functional and evolutionary branch within the overall human kinome (pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 1-2, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 4-6).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK18 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to specific serine/threonine residues on target protein substrates. The reaction can be described by the general equation: ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 6-7, barone2016humancdk18promotes pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe enzymatic activity of CDK18, like that of other cyclin‐dependent serine/threonine kinases, depends on the presence of divalent metal ions, most notably Mg²⁺, which is required for ATP binding and catalysis (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 6-7).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCDK18 functions as a serine/threonine kinase; although its precise consensus substrate motif has not been completely delineated, it is understood to display substrate specificity characteristics shared by many proline‐directed kinases. Available experimental data and proteomic surveys suggest that its substrate preferences resemble those of other CDKs, favoring phosphorylation at serine or threonine residues that are often immediately followed by a proline residue. Additionally, an atlas of substrate specificities for the human serine/threonine kinome indicates that kinases of this family generally target motifs with basic residues surrounding the phosphorylation site; however, the exact amino acid consensus for CDK18 remains less fully characterized (Johnson2023Atlas pages 759-766, pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 2-3).\n\n5. Structure  \nCDK18 comprises a central, highly conserved kinase domain flanked by extended N-terminal and shorter C-terminal regions. The kinase domain contains all the signature motifs found in the CDK family, including the glycine-rich loop involved in ATP binding, the catalytic HRD motif, and the DFG motif essential for coordinating Mg²⁺ and ATP binding (cole2009pctkproteinsthe pages 2-4, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 6-7). Uniquely, CDK18 harbors a variant motif—namely the PCTAIRE sequence in place of the canonical PSTAIRE—which is critical for its interaction with potential cyclin partners and for dictating conformational dynamics distinct from classical CDKs (pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 2-3, cole2009pctkproteinsthe pages 5-7). Although no experimental crystal structure of CDK18 is currently available, homology modeling based on the resolved structure of CDK16 (PCTAIRE1) (PDB ID: 5G6V) provides insight into its bi-lobal fold with an N-terminal lobe largely composed of β-strands and a C-terminal lobe dominated by α-helices. In this model, structural features such as the activation loop and the C-helix align with those of other active CDKs, while additional unique sequences—especially within the N-terminal extension—may serve as regulatory modules or mediate specific protein-protein interactions (pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 2-3, endicott2013structuralcharacterizationof pages 3-5).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of CDK18 activity involves multiple layers of control. Key regulatory mechanisms include binding to cyclins—most notably cyclin A2 and potentially cyclin E1—which are traditionally required to induce the conformational changes necessary for full catalytic activity (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 38-41, pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 11-13). In addition to cyclin binding, phosphorylation plays an important regulatory role; for instance, phosphorylation at serine 12 by protein kinase A (PKA) has been shown to enhance CDK18’s kinase activity independently as well as in conjunction with cyclin binding (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 38-41, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 9-10). CDK18 has also been reported to interact with regulatory proteins such as 14-3-3 and may be subject to further modulation through ubiquitination channels, with components like the ubiquitin ligase STUB1 potentially influencing its stability and localization (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 35-38, pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 13-14). These post-translational modifications constitute a complex regulatory network that controls the activation state and substrate engagement of CDK18, ensuring appropriate responses in terminally differentiated cells.\n\n7. Function  \nCDK18 is expressed preferentially in terminally differentiated cells, with notable expression in the brain and other post-mitotic tissues, but it is also detected in non-neuronal tissues such as kidney and heart (pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 1-2, cole2009pctkproteinsthe pages 2-4). Functionally, CDK18 is implicated in signal transduction cascades in terminally differentiated cells and may contribute to regulating cell cycle checkpoint responses in non-proliferative contexts. Its activity appears to be linked to modulation of the actin cytoskeleton and vesicular transport processes, including the regulation of aquaporin-2 trafficking via interactions with COPII complex components and regulatory proteins such as STUB1, which functions as an A-kinase anchoring protein (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 35-38, karimbayli2022dissectingtherole pages 68-71). CDK18 has also been associated with the maintenance of genome stability by participating in the cellular response to replication stress and the ATR-mediated DNA damage response, as evidenced by studies demonstrating increased DNA damage upon CDK18 depletion in cancer cell models (barone2016humancdk18promotes pages 1-2, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 18-19). In neuronal cells, CDK18’s capability to phosphorylate substrates such as tau has raised interest in its potential involvement in neurodegenerative disorders, although the detailed substrate spectrum in this compartment remains to be defined (cole2009pctkproteinsthe pages 8-10).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nAt present, selective inhibitors that specifically target CDK18 remain poorly characterized; most available small molecule inhibitors tend to be pan-CDK inhibitors that affect a broad spectrum of cyclin-dependent kinases. Some compounds, such as Dabrafenib, have been reported to inhibit related PCTAIRE kinases at clinically relevant concentrations, indicating that CDK18 might be susceptible to similar pharmacological interventions (karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 6-7, pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 4-6). Disease associations for CDK18 include its involvement in maintaining genomic stability and in signal transduction pathways relevant to cancer biology as well as neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s disease, where aberrant phosphorylation of tau protein has been noted (cole2009pctkproteinsthe pages 8-10, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 13-14). Although detailed reports on specific disease mutations or selective inhibitor efficacies are limited, the available data underscore CDK18’s emerging importance as a potential therapeutic target in oncology and neurology (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 41-44, barone2016humancdk18promotes pages 12-13).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nCyclin‐dependent kinase 20 (CDK20), also known as CCRK, belongs to the cyclin‐dependent kinase family within the CMGC group of serine/threonine kinases. Members of the CDK family are evolutionarily conserved across eukaryotes, and CDK20 is classified among the atypical CDKs that do not fall in the classical cell‐cycle CDKs such as CDK1 or CDK2. Its sequence conservation in the catalytic domain places it within the subgroup of kinases sharing a common evolutionary origin with other CDKs, as detailed in studies of kinase classification (malumbres2009cyclindependentkinasesa pages 2-4, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 1-2). Orthologs of CDK20 can be identified in other mammalian species, and its presence among the “dark kinome” reflects its relatively understudied status compared to canonical CDKs. Phylogenetic analyses based on conserved kinase domains indicate that CDK20 clusters with other members of the CMGC group, thereby inheriting the proline‐directed substrate preference typical of this family (johnson2023anatlasof pages 4-5, shah2020cdksfamilya pages 5-7).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nThe catalytic activity of CDK20 follows the canonical reaction characteristic of protein kinases. CDK20 transfers the γ‐phosphate from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine/threonine residues in substrate proteins. The overall reaction can be summarized as:  \n  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺  \nThis reaction is fundamental to modulating the function of downstream substrate proteins through phosphorylation (johnson2023anatlasof pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of CDK20, like that of most serine/threonine kinases, requires a divalent cation cofactor. Specifically, magnesium ions (Mg²⁺) are essential for proper ATP binding and phosphoryl transfer. The presence of Mg²⁺ aligns with the common cofactor requirement observed in the kinome and underlines its biochemical similarity to other members of the CMGC group (johnson2023anatlasof pages 1-2, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 2-3).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nSubstrate specificity for CDK20 is inferred from its membership in the CDK family, which as a group typically phosphorylate serine/threonine residues that precede or are immediately followed by a proline residue. In particular, members of the CDK subgroup are known to have a proline-directed consensus motif, generally favoring an S/T-P sequence. Detailed experimental profiling of human serine/threonine kinases by Johnson et al. has revealed that the CDK family exhibits strong enrichment for substrates with a proline at the +1 position relative to the phosphoacceptor site, with additional influences imparted by flanking basic residues that further modulate substrate recognition (johnson2023anatlasof pages 1-2, johnson2023anatlasof pages 6-7). Although explicit motifs unique to CDK20 have not been isolated in the published atlas, its classification within the cyclin-dependent kinase family strongly suggests that its substrate specificity conforms to the characteristic proline-directed motif, with potential nuances governed by its own regulatory and structural features (johnson2023anatlasof pages 3-4, malumbres2009cyclindependentkinasesa pages 2-4).\n\n5. Structure  \nCDK20 possesses a central catalytic domain typical of protein kinases that is approximately 250–300 amino acids in length. This domain is organized into two lobes: an N-terminal lobe that is predominantly composed of β-sheets and a C-terminal lobe that is mainly α-helical. Key structural features include a highly conserved ATP-binding cleft, the activation loop (T-loop), a DFG motif required for coordination of magnesium and ATP, and a C-helix that undergoes positioning changes upon cyclin binding. Although no dedicated crystal structure solely for CDK20 may be described in the primary literature provided, structural insights from related CDKs and large-scale kinase structural analyses provide a reliable model for its organization (elokely2013proteinkinasesstructure pages 40-49, wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 20-20). In addition, AlphaFold models of homologous CDKs suggest that the kinase domain of CDK20 may include additional regulatory sequences that facilitate cyclin interaction and substrate engagement. The conserved features, such as the glycine-rich loop in the N-terminal lobe and the catalytic HRD motif in the catalytic loop, are present in CDK20, reinforcing its ability to catalyze phosphorylation reactions. Furthermore, structural comparison with other CDKs indicates that CDK20 may exhibit unique insertions or extensions outside the kinase domain that could be important for its regulatory function in modulating primary cilium assembly and activation of downstream targets like CDK2 (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 2-3, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 1-2).\n\n6. Regulation  \nRegulation of CDK20 activity appears to follow general principles common to cyclin-dependent kinases. CDK20 is activated through binding of a regulatory cyclin partner, and this association induces conformational changes that reposition its C-helix and stabilize the activation loop, thereby facilitating optimal substrate binding. An established function of CDK20 is the activation of CDK2 by phosphorylating its Thr-160 residue, which is a critical post-translational modification required for full CDK2 activation (oskomic2025keap1nrf2interactionin pages 14-15). In addition, regulatory phosphorylation events at key residues within CDK20’s activation loop likely occur, although specific modification sites beyond its catalytic targets remain to be fully characterized. Control by cyclins, such as cyclin H or cyclin Y – as is the case for closely related CDKs – may also contribute to its spatial and temporal regulation in the cell. Overall, CDK20 regulation involves both conformational modulation upon cyclin binding and phosphorylation events that facilitate its kinase activity toward specific substrates (shah2020cdksfamilya pages 5-7, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 9-10).\n\n7. Function  \nCDK20 performs multiple roles critical to both developmental signaling and cell cycle regulation. One of its most notable functions is its requirement for high-level Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) responses during neural tube development. By coordinating with the protein TBC1D32, CDK20 plays a central role in controlling the structure of the primary cilium – a specialized cellular organelle essential for proper Shh signal transduction and subsequent activation of GLI2 transcription factors. Additionally, CDK20 is implicated in cell growth control through its activation of CDK2, a key regulator of cell cycle progression. Phosphorylation of CDK2 at Thr-160 by CDK20 is critical for advancing the cell cycle, linking CDK20’s kinase activity to the regulation of cell proliferation (johnson2023anatlasof pages 1-2, chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 21-22). Expression data indicate that CDK20 is active in tissues where precise regulation of cell division and signal transduction is required, notably in developing neural tissue. Its dual roles in modulating primary cilium assembly and cell cycle control suggest that it is an integral component of signaling pathways that coordinate developmental processes with proliferative capacity (hope2023emergingapproachesto pages 1-2, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 9-10).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nCDK20 is also known by several alternative names, including CDK-activating kinase p42, Cell cycle-related kinase, Cell division protein kinase 20, Cyclin-dependent protein kinase H, and Cyclin-kinase-activating kinase p42. These synonyms reflect its diverse identification in different studies and its multifaceted roles in cell regulation. Although specific inhibitors targeting CDK20 have not yet been extensively characterized, its central role in primary cilium maintenance and CDK2 activation earmarks it as a potential therapeutic target, especially in contexts where aberrant Shh signaling or dysregulated cell division contributes to disease. Its overexpression or mutation might be linked with developmental abnormalities or cancer, although detailed disease associations and the impact of mutations on its function remain subjects for ongoing investigation. The integration of large-scale substrate specificity data, detailed phylogenetic analysis, and structural modeling is expected to further refine our understanding of CDK20 and facilitate the development of selective small-molecule inhibitors (pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 56-56, pluta2024cyclin‐dependentkinasesmasters pages 28-29).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nFructosamine-3-kinase (FN3K; UniProt Q9H479) is an evolutionarily conserved member of the protein kinase‐like (PKL) superfamily that appears in a wide range of species including mammals, birds, plants, and lower eukaryotes as well as prokaryotes. FN3K orthologs have been identified in metazoans where gene duplication events have given rise not only to the canonical FN3K but also to a related protein (FN3K-related protein, FN3K-RP), with the two sharing approximately 65% sequence identity and adjacent genomic organization (avemaria2015possibleroleof pages 1-2, schaftingen2012enzymaticrepairof pages 2-4). Comparative analyses using evolutionary systems biology approaches have placed FN3K within the “eukaryotic‐like kinases” cluster that is distinct from classical eukaryotic protein kinases, yet sharing key catalytic and nucleotide‐binding features with small–molecule kinases such as aminoglycoside phosphotransferases (shrestha2023elucidatingtheunderstudied pages 13-17, shrestha2023elucidatingtheunderstudiedc pages 13-17). Its phylogenetic distribution is consistent with its presence in a core set of enzymes that appeared in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) as supported by studies of the human kinome (Manning2002The protein kinase complement of the human genome, Manning2002Evolution of protein kinase signaling from yeast to man) and further expanded by more recent computational analyses (shrestha2023elucidatingtheunderstudied pages 1-13). This conservation indicates that FN3K likely plays a fundamental role in cellular maintenance across different organisms (avemaria2015possibleroleof pages 1-2, shrestha2023elucidatingtheunderstudieda pages 1-13).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nFN3K catalyzes an ATP-dependent phosphorylation reaction that specifically targets the fructosamine moiety on glycated proteins. The reaction can be summarized as follows: ATP + [protein]-fructoselysine → ADP + [protein]-fructoselysine-3-phosphate + H⁺. Phosphorylation at the 3-position of the sugar adduct destabilizes the glycated linkage, resulting in an unstable fructoselysine-3-phosphate intermediate that spontaneously decomposes under physiological conditions to regenerate the unmodified lysine residue along with the release of inorganic phosphate and a reactive deoxy derivative (avemaria2015possibleroleof pages 1-2, beisswenger2001humanfructosamine3kinasepurification pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of FN3K depends on the presence of ATP as the phosphate donor and requires divalent metal ions most commonly Mg²⁺ to coordinate with nucleotide phosphates during the catalytic process. These cofactors are necessary for proper binding and stabilization of ATP within the enzyme’s active site, as demonstrated in biochemical studies and enzyme assays (krause2006aconvenienthplc pages 1-2, garg2025themolecularbasis pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nFN3K exhibits a highly selective substrate specificity for fructosamine residues that are covalently attached to lysine side chains on proteins. It preferentially phosphorylates protein-bound fructoselysine rather than free fructosamines or other ketosamine intermediates, a preference that is reflected in the markedly lower Km values observed for glycated proteins compared to free sugar substrates (beisswenger2001humanfructosamine3kinasepurification pages 4-6, avemaria2015possibleroleof pages 1-2). In addition, FN3K is capable of phosphorylating structural isomers such as psicosamines and ribulosamines, thereby broadening its substrate profile, though the enzyme demonstrates especially high specificity towards fructoselysine adducts (beeraka2021thetamingof pages 12-14, garg2025themolecularbasis pages 1-2). Notably, recent large-scale studies of kinase substrate preferences for serine/threonine kinases and tyrosine kinases have provided extensive maps of consensus motifs, and while FN3K does not phosphorylate conventional protein serine/threonine or tyrosine residues, the rigorous substrate specificity analyses reported by Johnson et al. (2023) and Yaron-Barir et al. (2024) serve as a benchmark for understanding how kinases discern their substrates (Johnson2023An atlas of substrate specificities for the human serine/threonine kinome, Yaron-Barir2024The intrinsic substrate specificity of the human tyrosine kinome). These studies highlight that FN3K’s substrate motif does not conform to classical consensus sequences but rather is defined by the chemical nature of the glycated lysine adduct (shrestha2023elucidatingtheunderstudied pages 27-32).\n\n5. Structure  \nFN3K is composed of 309 amino acids, resulting in an approximate molecular weight of 34–35 kDa as determined by purification studies from human tissues (beisswenger2001humanfructosamine3kinasepurification pages 1-2). The enzyme adopts a protein kinase-like fold that comprises a bilobal structure with a smaller, β-strand–rich N-terminal lobe responsible for binding ATP, and a larger, predominantly α-helical C-terminal lobe that provides the substrate-binding surface (garg2025themolecularbasis pages 3-4, shrestha2023elucidatingtheunderstudiedc pages 27-32). A unique structural feature of FN3K is the presence of a conserved cysteine residue located within the ATP-binding P-loop. This cysteine is critical for redox-sensitive regulation; under oxidizing conditions, it promotes the formation of an interchain disulfide bond that results in a strand-exchange dimer conformation, leading to altered enzymatic activity (shrestha2023elucidatingtheunderstudied pages 27-32, shrestha2023elucidatingtheunderstudieda pages 90-95). In contrast, reducing conditions disrupt the disulfide linkage, favoring the monomeric and catalytically active form of the enzyme (shrestha2023elucidatingtheunderstudied pages 17-22, shrestha2023elucidatingtheunderstudieda pages 90-95). In addition, AlphaFold multimer models and crystallographic data from plant homologs such as Arabidopsis thaliana FN3K have provided insights into the spatial organization of key catalytic residues, the orientation of the nucleotide-binding pocket, and the disposition of substrate-interacting elements (garg2025themolecularbasis pages 3-4, shrestha2023elucidatingtheunderstudied pages 13-17). These structural insights collectively underscore FN3K’s classification within the protein kinase family while highlighting its unique adaptations for recognizing and processing nonprotein sugar adducts.\n\n6. Regulation  \nRegulation of FN3K occurs primarily through redox-dependent mechanisms. The enzyme contains a conserved cysteine in its ATP-binding P-loop; the oxidation status of this cysteine determines the oligomeric state and catalytic competency of FN3K. Under oxidizing conditions, the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds between this P-loop cysteine stabilizes an inactive dimeric conformation, whereas reduction of the bond shifts the equilibrium toward the active monomeric form (shrestha2023elucidatingtheunderstudied pages 27-32, shrestha2020aredoxactiveswitch pages 1-1). This redox switch has been implicated in modulating FN3K activity under conditions of oxidative stress and is supported by both in vitro analyses and cell-based studies (garg2025themolecularbasis pages 8-10, shrestha2023elucidatingtheunderstudied pages 17-22). In addition to redox regulation, FN3K activity is modulated at the level of gene polymorphism and expression, with evidence that genetic variation in the FN3K gene alters its enzymatic efficiency and may correlate with glycation levels in diabetic patients (avemaria2015possibleroleof pages 1-2, beisswenger2001humanfructosamine3kinasepurification pages 6-7). No specific post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation or ubiquitination have been definitively mapped in FN3K; current experimental data primarily underscore the importance of its redox-regulated disulfide formation in controlling its catalytic state.\n\n7. Function  \nFN3K is principally involved in the enzymatic deglycation of proteins. It phosphorylates fructosamine modifications – typically fructoselysine residues – formed by the nonenzymatic addition of reducing sugars such as glucose to lysine side chains. The phosphorylation reaction destabilizes the glycation adducts, thereby facilitating their spontaneous decomposition and effectively “repairing” the protein by restoring the free amine group (avemaria2015possibleroleof pages 1-2, beisswenger2001humanfructosamine3kinasepurification pages 1-2). This deglycation activity is particularly important in long-lived cells such as erythrocytes, where accumulation of glycated proteins contributes to cellular dysfunction in diabetic conditions (krause2006aconvenienthplc pages 1-2). In addition, FN3K has been reported to phosphorylate and thereby deglycate non-traditional substrates, including psicosamines and ribulosamines, expanding its functional repertoire (beeraka2021thetamingof pages 12-14, garg2025themolecularbasis pages 1-2). FN3K also plays a role in modulating the function of the transcription factor NFE2L2/NRF2 by reversing glycation modifications that impair its activity, which suggests a role for FN3K in the cellular response to oxidative stress (garg2025themolecularbasis pages 8-10, shrestha2023elucidatingtheunderstudied pages 95-101). Expression of FN3K is ubiquitous, with high levels reported in erythrocytes, the lens, and brain tissues – an expression pattern consistent with its role in protecting long-lived proteins from irreversible glycation-induced damage (avemaria2015possibleroleof pages 1-2, beisswenger2001humanfructosamine3kinasepurification pages 6-7).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nFN3K has drawn interest as a potential therapeutic target given its central role in protein deglycation and the modulation of advanced glycation end product (AGE) formation—a process implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications and certain age-related diseases. Although detailed inhibitor profiles for FN3K have yet to be fully established, structural studies have opened the possibility of designing small-molecule inhibitors that specifically target its redox-sensitive regulatory mechanism (garg2025themolecularbasis pages 8-10, shrestha2023elucidatingtheunderstudied pages 27-32). In addition, polymorphisms in the FN3K gene have been associated with variable enzyme activity and glycation levels in diabetic patients, suggesting that genetic screening for FN3K variants may be useful in patient stratification and in guiding personalized therapeutic approaches (avemaria2015possibleroleof pages 1-2, beisswenger2001humanfructosamine3kinasepurification pages 6-7). In parallel, insights from substrate specificity atlases for the human serine/threonine and tyrosine kinomes (Johnson2023An atlas of substrate specificities for the human serine/threonine kinome, Yaron-Barir2024The intrinsic substrate specificity of the human tyrosine kinome) provide context regarding kinase substrate recognition even though FN3K’s unique substrate type sets it apart from canonical protein kinases. These collective findings underscore FN3K’s significance as a repair enzyme that may impact cellular responses to hyperglycemia and oxidative stress without invoking additional regulatory pathways beyond those already identified.\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nSerine/threonine‐protein kinase DCLK1 (also known as DCAMKL1, DCDC3A, or KIAA0369; UniProt: O15075) is a member of the doublecortin (DCX) family that is evolutionarily conserved among metazoans. DCLK1 falls within the larger calcium/calmodulin‐dependent kinase (CAMK) group and shares conserved sequence motifs and domain architecture with kinases involved in neuronal migration and microtubule regulation. Orthologs of DCLK1 are found across mammalian species and other eukaryotes, and gene duplication events have produced related paralogs such as DCLK2 and DCLK3. In addition, alternative splicing generates isoforms (for example, DCLK1.1 and DCLK1.2) that differ primarily in the sequence and length of their C‐terminal regulatory tail, which modulates autoinhibition. These evolutionary relationships and isoform‐specific variations underscore a conserved kinase core accompanied by unique regulatory elements that have emerged during eukaryotic evolution (venkat2023mechanisticandevolutionary pages 1-2, dijkmans2010thedoublecortingene pages 10-11).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nDCLK1 catalyzes the phosphorylation reaction in which ATP and a protein substrate containing serine or threonine are converted to ADP, a phosphorylated protein, and a proton. This reaction can be summarized as:  \n  ATP + [protein]‑(L‑serine or L‑threonine) → ADP + [protein]‑(L‑serine/threonine)‑phosphate + H⁺  \nThis chemical transformation is typical for serine/threonine kinases and is central to the regulation of numerous cellular processes (carli2022thefunctionofa pages 257-259).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of DCLK1 is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions. In common with many serine/threonine kinases, DCLK1 requires Mg²⁺ as a cofactor for optimal ATP binding and phosphoryl transfer. This Mg²⁺ dependency is necessary to stabilize the negative charges of ATP’s phosphate groups during catalysis (patel2016biochemicalandstructural pages 3-4, venkat2023mechanisticandevolutionary pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nDCLK1 is a serine/threonine kinase with substrate specificity that, based on recent substrate‐specificity profiling studies, favors certain consensus motifs typical of the human serine/threonine kinome. In addition to its autophosphorylation capabilities, proteomic and phosphoproteomic studies have revealed that DCLK1 modulates phosphorylation on several substrates involved in cytoskeletal regulation, RNA processing, autophagy, and cell cycle control. In particular, phosphorylation sites identified in substrates such as RPS6KA3, ATG9A, CMTR1, BIRC3, and CDC42BPG suggest that DCLK1 recognizes and phosphorylates sequences with specific amino acid preferences. Recent work (Johnson et al. 2023) has provided an atlas of substrate specificities for the human serine/threonine kinome, and although the precise consensus motif for DCLK1 is still under active investigation, it appears to require a local environment that may include hydrophobic and basic residues proximal to the phosphorylation site (carli2022thefunctionofa pages 150-154, carli2023structureguidedpredictionof pages 16-17).\n\n5. Structure  \nDCLK1 is a multidomain protein characterized by a modular organization that underpins its dual functions as both a microtubule‐associated protein (MAP) and a catalytic kinase. The N-terminus comprises two tandem doublecortin (DC) domains—designated DC1 and DC2—that share approximately 80% and 87% sequence similarity, respectively, with the classical DCX protein. DC1 preferentially binds to polymerized microtubules (α/β-tubulin heterodimers), whereas DC2 has the capacity to interact with both polymerized and soluble tubulin, thereby facilitating microtubule nucleation and stabilization (carli2022thefunctionof pages 42-45, carli2022thefunctionof pages 45-48; dijkmans2010thedoublecortingene pages 10-11).\n\nConnecting the DC domains to its catalytic domain is a PEST-rich linker region that is enriched in proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine residues. This region is thought to be highly accessible on the protein surface and may act as a docking platform for other regulatory proteins or proteolytic enzymes such as calpain. Following the PEST linker, the C-terminal portion of DCLK1 contains a serine/threonine kinase domain that adopts a canonical bilobal structure comprising an N-terminal lobe responsible for ATP binding and a larger C-terminal lobe responsible for substrate recognition. Within the kinase domain, key elements including the glycine-rich loop, the catalytic loop (featuring the invariant D511 residue critical for catalysis), the DFG motif in the activation segment, and the C-helix (which participates in a critical salt bridge with a lysine residue) have been identified by crystallographic studies and are consistent with a CaMKI-like fold (patel2016biochemicalandstructural pages 1-3, carli2022thefunctionof pages 42-45).\n\nThe C-terminal tail of DCLK1 functions as an autoinhibitory domain (AID) that modulates kinase activity. Structural models, including those derived from AlphaFold predictions, suggest that this tail makes intramolecular contacts with the catalytic domain, occluding the ATP-binding site and thereby suppressing kinase activity in the absence of appropriate activating signals. A well-known kinase-dead mutation, D511N, serves as an important functional marker by abolishing catalytic activity and simultaneously altering microtubule binding, underscoring the interdependence of the kinase and microtubule-regulatory functions (carli2022thefunctionof pages 42-45, carli2022thefunctionof pages 45-48, patel2016biochemicalandstructural pages 3-4).\n\n6. Regulation  \nDCLK1 is regulated at multiple levels through post-translational modifications as well as intramolecular interactions that control the balance between its kinase activity and microtubule binding. Autophosphorylation is a key regulatory mechanism whereby DCLK1 phosphorylates itself on specific serine residues, including those within or near the DC domains. In particular, phosphorylation at Ser32—a residue homologous to Ser28 in DCX—acts as a molecular switch that modulates DCLK1’s affinity for microtubules, with phosphorylation leading to reduced microtubule binding and enhanced actin interaction (carli2022thefunctionof pages 42-45, carli2022thefunctionofa pages 150-154, rogers2020autoregulatorycontrolof pages 1-3).\n\nThe PEST-rich linker region is heavily phosphorylated by multiple kinases including CDK5, GSK3, ERK1, and JNK; these modifications influence cellular localization and microtubule polymerization dynamics. This region may also serve as a site for proteolytic cleavage, further regulating the availability of distinct isoforms with different functional properties (carli2022thefunctionof pages 42-45, carli2022thefunctionof pages 45-48). In addition, the C-terminal autoinhibitory domain exerts negative regulation on the kinase domain by physically interfering with substrate and ATP access; removal of this domain or mutations that destabilize its interaction (such as D511N) results in derepression of kinase activity and altered intracellular distribution (carli2022thefunctionofb pages 45-48, rogers2020autoregulatorycontrolof pages 3-5).\n\nUpstream regulators, including kinases such as GSK3B and MARK1, have been implicated in modulating phosphorylation within the N-terminal regions of DCLK1. Moreover, there is evidence that DCLK1 activity may influence adjacent phosphatases (for example ILKAP) that indirectly regulate phosphorylation of its own regulatory sites. These convergent mechanisms contribute to a highly dynamic and context-dependent regulation of DCLK1 in cellular pathways (carli2022thefunctionof pages 210-213, rogers2020autoregulatorycontrolof pages 1-3).\n\n7. Function  \nDCLK1 is a multifunctional protein that integrates kinase signaling with microtubule dynamics, thus contributing to both neuronal development and cellular homeostasis. In the developing brain, DCLK1 is implicated in calcium-signaling pathways that control neuronal migration, thereby affecting the proper formation of cortical layers. Its prominent expression in neuronal progenitor cells and migrating neurons supports a role in guiding axon outgrowth, dendritic branching, and cellular polarity during neurogenesis (carli2022thefunctionofa pages 38-42, carli2022thefunctionofa pages 45-48).\n\nBeyond its roles in the nervous system, DCLK1 is overexpressed in several solid tumors, including gastric, colorectal, pancreatic, and renal cancers, where it correlates with poor clinical outcomes. In these settings, DCLK1 functions as a marker of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and is implicated in promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell invasion, and metastasis. Proteomic analyses have identified an array of potential substrates whose phosphorylation by DCLK1 modulates cytoskeletal reorganization, cell cycle progression, and extracellular matrix remodeling. These substrates include proteins involved in MAPK signaling (e.g., RPS6KA3), autophagy (e.g., ATG9A), anti-apoptotic pathways (e.g., BIRC3), and RNA processing (e.g., CMTR1) (carli2022thefunctionof pages 160-180, carli2022thefunctionofb pages 210-213).\n\nDCLK1’s dual capacity to function as a microtubule-binding MAP and a catalytic kinase ensures that it can coordinate intracellular transport, mitotic spindle organization, and cell polarity. This coordination is essential during cell division and migration and provides a mechanistic link between structural dynamics and signal transduction. The aberrant expression and activity of DCLK1 in malignant cells contribute to dysregulated cell motility and invasiveness, in part by altering the phosphorylation state of key cytoskeletal regulators (carli2022thefunctionof pages 38-42, carli2022thefunctionofa pages 210-213).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral small-molecule inhibitors targeting DCLK1 have been developed, most notably DCLK1‑IN‑1, which has demonstrated potent and selective inhibition of DCLK1 kinase activity in preclinical models. These inhibitors are being investigated for their potential to reverse oncogenic phenotypes, particularly in gastrointestinal cancers. In addition, chemical biology toolkits have been established that include engineered kinase-dead mutants (such as D511N) to dissect DCLK1 function and to validate inhibitor specificity (ferguson2020discoveryofa pages 7-8, liu2020chemicalbiologytoolkit pages 10-11).\n\nDCLK1 is also associated with altered vesicular trafficking and extracellular vesicle composition in tumor cells, which may contribute to changes in the tumor microenvironment and promote metastatic behavior. In several cancer studies, DCLK1 overexpression correlates with enhanced EMT and poor overall survival, underscoring its potential as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target. In the context of neurobiology, DCLK1 participates in key calcium-signaling pathways that are critical for normal brain development and cellular homeostasis, suggesting that its dysregulation may also contribute to neurological disorders.\n\nNotable disease mutations affecting DCLK1 have not been described in detail in the current context; however, the kinase-dead mutation D511N is frequently used as a functional inactivation control in experimental systems. The interplay between DCLK1’s kinase activity and its microtubule-binding function is central to its role in both normal development and disease, and ongoing studies continue to refine our understanding of its regulatory mechanisms via phosphorylation and proteolytic processing (chen2023molecularmechanismof pages 15-17).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nSerine/threonine‐protein kinase DCLK2, also known by the gene symbols DCLK2, DCAMKL2, DCDC3B, and DCK2, is a member of the doublecortin (DCX) superfamily. This family is characterized by the presence of tandem doublecortin (DCX) domains, which mediate microtubule binding, and a C‐terminal serine/threonine kinase domain that is linked to the calcium/calmodulin‐dependent kinase (CaMK) clade. Within the human kinome, DCLK2 is grouped with its paralogs DCLK1 and DCLK3; the phylogenetic analysis indicates that the divergence between DCLK1 and DCLK2 occurred during vertebrate evolution, with both forming distinct monophyletic clades that are absent in invertebrates, whereas DCLK3 represents a more divergent and ancestral paralog within the DCX‐containing kinases (hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 3-5, venkat2023mechanisticandevolutionary pages 4-5, reiner2006theevolvingdoublecortin pages 1-2). Further, seminal studies on the protein kinase complement of the human genome have placed DCLK2 within the calcium/calmodulin‐dependent kinase group, which itself traces its origins to the last common ancestor of eukaryotes; this evolutionary framework establishes DCLK2 as part of an ancient and conserved signaling module that has undergone gene duplication and subsequent specialization in vertebrates (venkat2023mechanisticandevolutionary pages 1-2, reiner2006theevolvingdoublecortin pages 2-4, Manning2002Science, Manning2002Trends).  \n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nDCLK2 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to the –OH group of serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins. The overall catalyzed reaction can be represented as:  \n  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺  \nThis reaction is a hallmark of serine/threonine kinases and underpins the role of DCLK2 in modulating the phosphorylation state of its substrates (template information).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of DCLK2 requires the presence of divalent cations, with Mg²⁺ serving as the key cofactor. Mg²⁺ ions are essential for optimal binding of ATP within the nucleotide-binding pocket and thereby facilitate the transfer of the phosphate group to substrate proteins (template information).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nDCLK2, as a member of the serine/threonine kinases within the CaMK-related subgroup, phosphorylates substrates on serine/threonine residues. Although detailed substrate motifs for DCLK2 have not been exclusively delineated in the provided context, the atlas of substrate specificities for the human serine/threonine kinome indicates that kinases in similar families often display preferences for motifs enriched in basic residues preceding the phosphorylatable serine or threonine. In the context of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), DCLK2 phosphorylates TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) at Ser172, a modification that is critical for TBK1 activation and subsequent tumorigenic processes (hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 3-5, hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 10-11, johnson2023anatlasof pages 4-4, johnson2023anatlasof pages 4-5). Thus, in addition to its general serine/threonine kinase activity, DCLK2 exhibits substrate selectivity that underlies its role in specific signaling cascades and cellular contexts.  \n\n5. Structure  \nDCLK2 possesses a modular architecture that is typical of proteins within the doublecortin family. The N-terminal region comprises two DCX domains that are critical for binding to microtubules, thereby contributing to the regulation of microtubule dynamics and neuronal migration. Each DCX domain is approximately 90 amino acids in length and contains conserved motifs critical for interaction with polymerized tubulin (reiner2006theevolvingdoublecortin pages 1-2, reiner2006theevolvingdoublecortin pages 11-12). Following the DCX domains, DCLK2 contains a C-terminal serine/threonine kinase domain that adopts a conventional bilobal fold. This catalytic domain contains the characteristic glycine-rich loop, the catalytic HRD motif within the activation loop (T-loop), and the DFG motif that coordinates the binding of Mg²⁺ and ATP (venkat2023mechanisticandevolutionary pages 23-24, patel2016biochemicalandstructural pages 3-4). In certain isoforms identified in cancer cells, variations in the C-terminal tail have been observed; for instance, the DCLK2203 isoform, which lacks an autoinhibitory threonine (T693) that is present in the DCLK2201 isoform, displays higher intrinsic kinase activity (hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 10-11). Although high-resolution structural data on full-length DCLK2 are not provided in the context, available information from related DCLK family members and AlphaFold modeling predict that the kinase domain of DCLK2 is flanked by flexible regulatory regions that could contribute to allosteric control and interaction with other proteins. The conserved key residues within the kinase domain, including those that form the hydrophobic spine and the C-helix, are essential for its catalytic function and are maintained within DCLK2 (venkat2023mechanisticandevolutionary pages 23-24, reiner2006theevolvingdoublecortin pages 12-14).  \n\n6. Regulation  \nThe activity of DCLK2 is regulated at multiple levels. Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, play a pivotal role in modulating its kinase activity. For example, the phosphorylation of its substrates, such as TBK1 on Ser172, is a critical regulatory event that enhances downstream signaling in oncogenic contexts like clear cell renal cell carcinoma (hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 3-5, hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 10-11). In addition, isoform-specific regulatory mechanisms have been described in related DCLK family kinases; differences in the length and composition of the C-terminal regulatory segments can lead to autoinhibition or “supercharging” of the catalytic activity, as seen in comparisons between DCLK1 isoforms (venkat2023mechanisticandevolutionary pages 15-17, venkat2023mechanisticandevolutionary pages 14-15). Although such detailed dissection has been performed primarily for DCLK1, the conservation of key regulatory motifs—such as residues that mimic ATP binding and modulate the hydrophobic spine—suggests that similar mechanisms operate in DCLK2. In addition, regulation by mRNA decay pathways appears to be significant; for instance, in ccRCC, decreased activity of the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway results in elevated levels of the active DCLK2 isoform (hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 10-11). This transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, combined with the potential for phosphorylation-dependent conformational changes, constitutes the multifaceted regulation of DCLK2.  \n\n7. Function  \nDCLK2 is implicated in a range of cellular processes through its dual functionality as both a microtubule-associated protein and a serine/threonine kinase. The doublecortin domains facilitate binding to microtubules, thereby influencing neuronal migration, axon growth, and microtubule polymerization—a function that is critically important during brain development (reiner2006theevolvingdoublecortin pages 4-7, ramkumar2018remappingthemicrotubule pages 17-19, ayanlaja2017distinctfeaturesof pages 8-9). In addition, DCLK2’s kinase activity plays a key role in signaling pathways relevant to both neurodevelopment and oncogenesis. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma, for example, DCLK2 phosphorylates TBK1 at Ser172, an event that is essential for TBK1 activation and supports tumor cell proliferation, tumor growth, and metastasis (hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 3-5, hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 10-11). Beyond cancer, by similarity to its paralog DCLK1, DCLK2 is predicted to contribute to the down-regulation of cyclic AMP response element (CRE)-dependent gene activation, likely via phosphorylation of the CREB coactivator CRTC2/TORC2, resulting in the retention of TORC2 in the cytoplasm (Information section; carli2022thefunctionof pages 42-45). DCLK2’s expression pattern is observed in neural tissues given its shared domain architecture with other DCX family proteins; this suggests a role in neuronal migration and neural network formation, as well as in the maintenance of microtubule stability in mature neurons (reiner2006theevolvingdoublecortin pages 2-4, chard2022investigatingproteinsproximal pages 205-208). The involvement of DCLK2 in both developmental and oncogenic signaling pathways underscores its function as a critical regulatory node in cellular homeostasis and disease.  \n\n8. Other Comments  \nSelective inhibition of the DCLK family has become an area of active investigation due to the oncogenic potential of these kinases. Notably, DCLK1-IN-1, a potent and selective inhibitor originally developed for DCLK1, has been shown to effectively target both DCLK1 and DCLK2 kinase activities with high specificity, as demonstrated by chemoproteomic profiling and kinome-wide screening assays (ferguson2020discoveryofa pages 1-2, ferguson2020discoveryofa pages 7-8). This selectivity is particularly important given the challenges associated with inhibiting kinases with conserved ATP-binding sites. Furthermore, the dysregulation of DCLK2—evidenced by its increased expression via modulation of the nonsense-mediated decay pathway in ccRCC—provides a rationale for its consideration as a therapeutic target in cancer (hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 10-11). Despite the overlap in function and structure with DCLK1, differences in the C-terminal tail and autoinhibitory mechanisms between DCLK1 and DCLK2 may yield isoform-specific sensitivity to inhibitors. In addition, while the role of DCLK2 in neuronal development is inferred from its structural conservation with other DCX family members, its direct implication in neurodevelopmental disorders remains to be further elucidated. The availability of selective chemical probes and advanced structural models, such as those derived from AlphaFold predictions, will facilitate a more detailed understanding of the biochemical regulation and potential disease mutations affecting DCLK2.  \n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nSerine/threonine‐protein kinase BRSK1 is an evolutionarily conserved member of the AMPK‐related kinase family that is ubiquitously found across metazoans, with orthologs in mouse, Caenorhabditis elegans (where it is known as SAD‐1), Drosophila, and ascidians (aguirre2014lkb1ampktsc2signalingpathway pages 56-60). It is grouped within the CAMK family of kinases and forms a subcluster with its close paralog BRSK2 and related MARK kinases, reflecting a conserved role in neuronal polarity and synaptic organization (babot2014regulaciódela pages 221-225). Comparative kinase analyses have positioned BRSK1 within an evolutionary core set of signaling components that emerged early in eukaryotic evolution, consistent with the phylogenetic frameworks reported by Manning and colleagues in landmark studies (lyn2011theregulationof pages 65-70).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nBRSK1 catalyzes the transfer of the γ‐phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of specific serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins, thereby converting ATP to ADP and yielding a phosphorylated substrate plus a proton; the overall reaction is: ATP + [protein] – OH → ADP + [protein] – OPO₃²⁻ + H⁺ (bright2008investigatingtheregulation pages 1-1).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nLike most serine/threonine kinases, BRSK1 requires Mg²⁺ ions as an essential cofactor to enable the proper binding and orientation of ATP in the catalytic cleft, thereby facilitating effective phosphate transfer (bright2008investigatingtheregulation pages 2-3).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nBRSK1 phosphorylates a defined subset of substrates that play central roles in neuronal polarity and cell cycle regulation; these include the phosphatases CDC25B and CDC25C, the microtubule-associated protein MAPT/TAU, the active zone protein RIMS1, the centrosomal proteins TUBG1 and TUBG2, and the cell cycle regulator WEE1 (aguirre2014lkb1ampktsc2signalingpathway pages 56-60). Substrate specificity studies, such as those reported in the human serine/threonine kinase substrate atlas, indicate that kinases of the CAMK cluster—including BRSK1—often favor consensus sequences with upstream basic residues that help orient the target serine/threonine for phosphorylation (johnson2023anatlasof pages 4-4, banerjee2013phosphorylationubiquitylationand pages 35-39).\n\n5. Structure  \nBRSK1 consists of an N-terminal kinase catalytic domain that contains the conserved motifs required for ATP binding and phosphotransfer, including the glycine-rich loop, the catalytic loop (containing the HRD motif), and the activation (T-) loop (aguirre2014lkb1ampktsc2signalingpathway pages 56-60). Immediately downstream from the kinase domain is a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain; although this domain does not mediate ubiquitin binding, it is essential for stabilizing BRSK1’s active conformation and for proper phosphorylation by the upstream kinase LKB1 (babot2014regulaciódela pages 221-225). Current structural models, informed by experimentally derived data and AlphaFold predictions, suggest that BRSK1’s overall 3D organization comprises a conserved kinase core with flanking regulatory regions that modulate substrate access and catalytic efficiency (koduri2024proteinkinasec pages 1-8). The activation loop, which contains the key threonine residue (Thr189 in human BRSK1) that must be phosphorylated for full activity, is a critical regulatory element, and the proper positioning of the C-helix and formation of a hydrophobic spine appear to be necessary for an active kinase conformation (koduri2024proteinkinaseca pages 1-8).\n\n6. Regulation  \nActivation of BRSK1 is primarily achieved through phosphorylation of its activation loop at a conserved threonine residue (Thr189), a modification mediated by the upstream tumor suppressor kinase LKB1 in complex with accessory proteins such as STRAD and MO25 (aguirre2014lkb1ampktsc2signalingpathway pages 56-60, lyn2011theregulationof pages 65-70). In addition to this phosphorylation‐dependent activation, recent studies have demonstrated that BRSK1 activity is subject to redox regulation; reversible oxidative modifications of conserved cysteine residues within the kinase domain can modulate enzyme activity in response to intracellular reactive oxygen species (bendzunas2024redoxregulationof pages 1-3). Alterations in the integrity of the UBA domain also affect the ability of LKB1 to phosphorylate and activate BRSK1, further emphasizing the importance of intramolecular domain interactions (bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 2-3). Moreover, BRSK1 can be regulated by additional phosphorylation events; for example, phosphorylation by protein kinase C epsilon (PKCε) at specific serine residues (S555 and S559) has been shown to decrease its enzymatic activity, although such modifications do not appear to impact its subcellular distribution (koduri2024proteinkinaseca pages 13-21).\n\n7. Function  \nBRSK1 plays a critical role in the polarization of neurons by phosphorylating substrates that govern cytoskeletal organization and synaptic vesicle dynamics; for instance, it phosphorylates MAPT/TAU, thereby influencing microtubule stability and neuronal polarity (aguirre2014lkb1ampktsc2signalingpathway pages 56-60). In addition, BRSK1 contributes to the regulation of centrosome duplication by phosphorylating the γ-tubulin isoforms TUBG1 and TUBG2 at Ser131, facilitating their translocation and function in centrosomal organization (aguirre2014lkb1ampktsc2signalingpathway pages 56-60). BRSK1 also modulates cell cycle checkpoints through its activity on key regulators; for example, phosphorylation of WEE1 at Ser642 leads to its down-regulation in postmitotic neurons, while phosphorylation of CDC25B and CDC25C is implicated in the UV-induced DNA damage response (aguirre2014lkb1ampktsc2signalingpathway pages 56-60, lyn2011theregulationofb pages 59-65). Expression of BRSK1 is predominantly restricted to the brain, where it localizes in part to synaptic vesicles, suggesting an additional role in neurotransmitter release via phosphorylation of RIMS1 (babot2014regulaciódela pages 221-225). Its integration in signaling networks downstream of LKB1 further connects BRSK1 to broader pathways controlling neuronal differentiation and genomic stability (tamir2019identificationandcharacterizationa pages 116-120).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nRecent research efforts have highlighted BRSK1 as a potential therapeutic target given its involvement in neuronal development and its association with neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 12-14). Studies have also investigated its role in modulating mTOR and AMPK signaling pathways, linking BRSK1 activity to the regulation of cellular energy stress and protein synthesis (tamir2019identificationandcharacterizationb pages 116-120). Experimental inhibitors that affect kinases within the CAMK family are under preclinical evaluation, and while compounds specifically targeting BRSK1 have been characterized in some studies, issues with selectivity remain a challenge (tamir2020pkisdeepdive pages 14-16). In addition, alterations in BRSK1 function due to genetic variants have been reported, although detailed mutation profiles and their direct functional impacts have not been fully elucidated in the current literature (babot2014regulaciódela pages 221-225). Ongoing research employing RNA interference, CRISPR-mediated gene disruption, and biochemical assays in neuronal models continues to refine our understanding of BRSK1’s role in cell polarity, synaptic function, and checkpoint control (sample2015polarizedactivitiesof pages 13-17).\n\n9.

Phosphorylates CDK16, CDC25C, MAPT/TAU, PAK1 and WEE1. Following phosphorylation and activation by STK11/LKB1, acts as a key regulator of polarization of cortical neurons, probably by mediating phosphorylation of microtubule-associated proteins such as MAPT/TAU at 'Thr-529' and 'Ser-579'. Also regulates neuron polarization by mediating phosphorylation of WEE1 at 'Ser-642' in postmitotic neurons, leading to down-regulate WEE1 activity in polarized neurons. Plays a role in the regulation of the mitotic cell cycle progress and the onset of mitosis. Plays a role in the regulation of insulin secretion in response to elevated glucose levels, probably via phosphorylation of CDK16 and PAK1. While BRSK2 phosphorylated at Thr-174 can inhibit insulin secretion (PubMed:22798068), BRSK2 phosphorylated at Thr-260 can promote insulin secretion (PubMed:22669945). Regulates reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny:  \nSerine/threonine‐protein kinase BRSK2 (UniProt ID: Q8IWQ3), also known as brain‐selective kinase 2, is classified as a member of the AMPK‐related kinase family within the broader CAMK group, and its orthologs are conserved across metazoan species including Caenorhabditis elegans (as SAD‐1) and Drosophila, with mammalian orthologs appearing as BRSK1 (also called SAD‑B) and BRSK2 (SAD‑A) that collectively participate in neuronal polarity and cell cycle regulation (aguirre2014lkb1ampktsc2signalingpathway pages 56-60, lyn2011theregulationof pages 59-65). Phylogenetic analyses, as described in seminal studies by Manning et al. (2002), place BRSK2 in an evolutionary conserved clade, indicating that it shares a common ancestry with a core set of kinases regulated by LKB1, and its evolutionary roots extend back to the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) (lyn2011theregulationof pages 59-65, aguirre2014lkb1ampktsc2signalingpathway pages 56-60). Detailed phylogenetic classification reveals that the AMPK‐related kinases, including BRSK2, form a distinct subgroup within the protein kinase complement of the human genome with clear relationships established with kinases such as MARKs and SIK, underscoring its placement within a conserved functional module regulating cell polarity, metabolism, and stress responses (aguirre2014lkb1ampktsc2signalingpathwaya pages 56-60, lyn2011theregulationof pages 65-70).  \n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed:  \nBRSK2 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine and threonine residues on its target protein substrates, following the general biochemical reaction mechanism for serine/threonine kinases, where ATP and a substrate protein yield ADP and a phosphorylated protein along with the liberation of a proton (guo2006brsk2isactivated pages 1-2, annunziata2020phosphorylationsitesin pages 1-3). This canonical phosphotransfer reaction is essential for modulating the activity, localization, and interaction capabilities of substrate proteins and is represented by the general equation: ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (johnson2023anatlasof pages 1-2, annunziata2020phosphorylationsitesin pages 1-3).  \n\n3. Cofactor Requirements:  \nThe catalytic activity of BRSK2 is dependent on divalent metal ions, with Mg²⁺ being the primary cofactor required for ATP binding and subsequent phosphotransfer activity, a feature that is typical for protein kinases of this class (liu2021leveragingdiversedatab pages 33-36, lyn2011theregulationof pages 59-65). In biochemical assays, the presence of Mg²⁺ is critical to stabilize the ATP molecule within the catalytic cleft of the kinase domain, thereby enabling the proper orientation of the phosphate group for transfer to substrate proteins (johnson2023anatlasof pages 1-2, guo2006brsk2isactivated pages 1-2).  \n\n4. Substrate Specificity:  \nBRSK2 displays a substrate specificity characteristic of AMPK‐related serine/threonine kinases, phosphorylating substrates that include a diverse range of proteins such as microtubule‐associated protein tau (MAPT), cell cycle regulators like CDC25C and WEE1, as well as proteins involved in insulin secretion such as CDK16 and PAK1 (aguirre2014lkb1ampktsc2signalingpathway pages 56-60, lyn2011theregulationof pages 59-65). Detailed mapping of substrate motifs based on large‐scale analysis from Johnson et al. (2023) indicates that BRSK2, like many serine/threonine kinases, has a preference for target sequences that present particular amino acid environments around the phosphorylated serine or threonine residue; for example, BRSK2 phosphorylates tau protein on specific residues such as Thr‐529 and Ser‐579, and it phosphorylates WEE1 at Ser‐642 in postmitotic neurons, thereby modulating their activities (johnson2023anatlasof pages 4-5, lyn2011theregulationof pages 65-70). The atlas of substrate specificities demonstrates that while the overall substrate motif for many serine/threonine kinases tends to be diverse, BRSK2’s phosphorylation events in neuronal and cell cycle pathways suggest a preference for substrates with regulatory roles in microtubule dynamics and cell division (johnson2023anatlasof pages 1-2, sugiyama2019largescalediscoveryof pages 6-8).  \n\n5. Structure:  \nBRSK2 consists of a central catalytic kinase domain that exhibits the typical bilobal architecture common to eukaryotic protein kinases, with an N-terminal lobe predominantly involved in ATP binding and a larger C-terminal lobe that facilitates substrate recognition and catalysis (aguirre2014lkb1ampktsc2signalingpathway pages 56-60, guo2006brsk2isactivated pages 1-2). Downstream of the catalytic domain, BRSK2 features a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain which is important for modulating the conformation of the kinase and influencing its activation state; notably, unlike its closely related isoform BRSK1, BRSK2 retains kinase activity even when mutations occur in the UBA domain, suggesting that the UBA domain in BRSK2 plays a regulatory rather than an essential catalytic role (aguirre2014lkb1ampktsc2signalingpathway pages 56-60, guo2006brsk2isactivated pages 4-5). Structural studies indicate that the activation loop of BRSK2 contains a highly conserved threonine residue (Thr-174) which is phosphorylated by the upstream tumor suppressor kinase LKB1, a modification that is critical for full catalytic activity (guo2006brsk2isactivated pages 1-2, aguirre2014lkb1ampktsc2signalingpathway pages 56-60). In addition, phosphorylation at Thr-260 by protein kinase A (PKA) has been demonstrated to enhance BRSK2 activity, thereby creating a multi-site regulatory mechanism that enables differential control of its function depending on cellular context (guo2006brsk2isactivated pages 2-4, guo2006brsk2isactivated pages 4-5). The overall three-dimensional structure, as predicted by AlphaFold and supported by biochemical and crystallographic data of homologous kinases, reveals the presence of conserved catalytic motifs such as the DFG motif, the activation segment, the C-helix, and residues comprising the hydrophobic spine, all of which are integral to proper kinase function (liu2021leveragingdiversedatab pages 33-36, annunziata2020phosphorylationsitesin pages 5-7).  \n\n6. Regulation:  \nThe regulatory mechanisms governing BRSK2 activity involve multiple layers of control, primarily through site-specific phosphorylation events. The phosphorylation of Thr-174 within the activation loop by LKB1 is indispensable for catalysis and aligns with the regulatory paradigm established for AMPK-related kinases (aguirre2014lkb1ampktsc2signalingpathway pages 56-60, lyn2011theregulationof pages 65-70). In addition, phosphorylation by PKA at Thr-260 has been shown to further enhance kinase activity, thereby differentiating BRSK2’s function by promoting distinct downstream signaling events such as insulin secretion versus inhibition, depending on the phosphorylation state (guo2006brsk2isactivated pages 2-4, guo2006brsk2isactivated pages 4-5). BRSK2 is also subject to regulation by proteolytic processing under conditions of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress where cleavage products have been observed in certain pathological conditions, potentially indicating a role in the apoptotic response (lyn2011theregulationofa pages 250-254, southekal2021integrativeanalysisof pages 114-120). Furthermore, BRSK2 undergoes autophosphorylation events that may fine-tune its catalytic output, while its interaction with specific regulatory proteins helps maintain proper subcellular localization and substrate access, particularly in neuronal contexts where precise polarization is required (aguirre2014lkb1ampktsc2signalingpathway pages 56-60, lyn2011theregulationof pages 65-70). These distinct modifications result in functional heterogeneity; for example, BRSK2 phosphorylated at Thr-174 has been associated with inhibition of insulin secretion, whereas phosphorylation at Thr-260 is correlated with stimulated insulin secretion, underscoring the importance of differential phosphorylation in tissue-specific and context-specific regulation (information section, guo2006brsk2isactivated pages 2-4).  \n\n7. Function:  \nBRSK2 plays a critical role in multiple cellular processes that are essential for proper neuronal development, cell cycle progression, and metabolic regulation. In the nervous system, BRSK2 is predominantly expressed in brain tissue where it acts as a key regulator of neuronal polarization and axonogenesis, achieved in part through the phosphorylation of microtubule-associated substrates such as MAPT/TAU; phosphorylation of tau at residues including Thr-529 and Ser-579 is instrumental in modulating microtubule stability and neuronal polarity (aguirre2014lkb1ampktsc2signalingpathway pages 56-60, annunziata2020phosphorylationsitesin pages 5-7). BRSK2 also directly phosphorylates WEE1 at Ser-642 in postmitotic neurons, leading to the down-regulation of WEE1’s inhibitory activity and thereby contributing to the transition of neurons to a polarized state (information section, lyn2011theregulationof pages 65-70). Beyond neuronal functions, BRSK2 exerts regulatory control over the mitotic cell cycle by phosphorylating cell cycle regulators such as CDC25C, with consequent promotion of mitotic entry, and by targeting proteins like CDK16 and PAK1 to modulate insulin secretion in response to elevated glucose levels (information section, southekal2021integrativeanalysisof pages 114-120). The kinase is implicated in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, supporting its role in cell morphology and migration, and it may also function in mediating the apoptotic response triggered by ER stress, thus linking it to cellular stress response pathways (information section, lyn2011theregulationofa pages 250-254, amakiri2021cellsignallinginterplayb pages 52-58). Collectively, these functions position BRSK2 as an essential regulator of both neurodevelopmental processes and metabolic signaling, with its activity precisely modulated by context-dependent phosphorylation events (information section, guo2006brsk2isactivated pages 2-4, annunziata2020phosphorylationsitesin pages 5-7).  \n\n8. Other Comments:  \nBRSK2 has been associated with several disease contexts, including neurodevelopmental disorders and various cancers, where its dysregulation may serve as a prognostic marker; studies have identified that alterations in BRSK2 expression or activity correlate with poor survival outcomes in certain tumor types, in addition to its established role in neuronal polarity and tau phosphorylation that may contribute to neurodegenerative conditions (southekal2021integrativeanalysisofa pages 114-120, alzahrani2022identificationandcharacterization pages 17-18). Although specific inhibitors targeting BRSK2 have not yet been thoroughly characterized in the literature, its position within the AMPK-related kinase family and its unique regulatory mechanisms, such as differential effects of phosphorylation at Thr-174 versus Thr-260, make it a potential candidate for selective therapeutic modulation; resources such as kinome inhibitor databases may eventually identify compounds with inhibitory activity against BRSK2 (information section, anti2009nonspecificserinethreonineprotein pages 119-121, bringas2025mechanismandcellular pages 39-43). Notable disease mutations or alterations in BRSK2 remain to be comprehensively catalogued, and further research is warranted to delineate the impact of such mutations on its substrate specificity and regulatory profile (information section, lyn2011theregulationof pages 65-70, southekal2021integrativeanalysisof pages 114-120).  \n\n9.

Constitutes the main protein kinase for extracellular proteins, generating the majority of the extracellular phosphoproteome (PubMed:26091039). Mainly phosphorylates proteins within the Ser-x-Glu/pSer motif, but also displays a broader substrate specificity (PubMed:26091039). Phosphorylates ERO1A, enhancing its activity which is required to maintain endoplasmic reticulum redox homeostasis and for oxidative protein folding (PubMed:29858230, PubMed:34349020). During endoplasmic reticulum stress, phosphorylates P4HB/PDIA1 which induces a functional switch, causing P4HB to change from an oxidoreductase to a molecular chaperone (PubMed:32149426). This is critical to maintain ER proteostasis and reduce cell death under ER stress (PubMed:32149426). Phosphorylation of P4HB also promotes its interaction with ERN1, leading to reduced activity of ERN1, a key sensor for the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response (PubMed:32149426). Required for osteoblast differentiation and mineralization (PubMed:34349020).

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nExtracellular serine/threonine protein kinase FAM20C (UniProt Q8IXL6) is a member of the Fam20 family of secretory kinases that includes FAM20A, FAM20B, and FAM20C itself. FAM20C is evolutionarily conserved across vertebrates, with validated orthologs present in species ranging from mouse to human and even lower metazoans, which underscores its fundamental roles in extracellular protein phosphorylation. Within the human kinome, FAM20C occupies a unique branch distinct from conventional intracellular kinases, aligning with findings that group it with the kinases dedicated to the secretory pathway (palmalara2021fam20coverviewclassic pages 1-2, cozza2015“genuine”caseinkinase pages 9-12). Evolutionary analyses have placed the Fam20 proteins within a core set of kinases present since the emergence of eukaryotes (as supported by the broader perspective outlined in Manning et al. 2002 and Manning et al. 2002, not shown here but required for context), with FAM20C representing one outcome of gene duplication events in the secretory branch. This conservation and grouping support a phylogenetic assignment of FAM20C into a distinct secretory kinase family that is separate from the standard AGC or tyrosine kinase families.\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nFAM20C catalyzes an ATP-dependent phosphorylation reaction in which a phosphate group is transferred from ATP to the hydroxyl group of target serine and, in some cases, threonine residues on secretory proteins. In its canonical reaction, the enzyme converts ATP and a protein substrate containing a serine (–OH) group to ADP, a phosphorylated protein containing a –PO₄ group on the serine residue, and a proton (H⁺). This reaction is analogous to that described for other protein kinases but is specialized for secreted substrates within the extracellular pathway (tagliabracci2013phosphorylationofsubstrates pages 1-2, chen2021proteolyticprocessingof pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of FAM20C depends on divalent metal ion cofactors in addition to ATP. FAM20C preferentially utilizes manganese (Mn²⁺) as its cofactor, although magnesium (Mg²⁺) may also support low-level activity under certain conditions. This requirement for Mn²⁺, rather than the more common Mg²⁺ used by most intracellular kinases, is a distinguishing feature of FAM20C’s enzymatic mechanism (cozza2015anewrole pages 1-2, xiao2013crystalstructureof pages 5-6).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nFAM20C exhibits substrate specificity primarily for secreted proteins, modifying serine residues within a consensus motif that is generally described as Ser–x–Glu (or phosphoSer) (S-x-E/pS). Although this motif is the principal target, FAM20C also displays broader substrate recognition capabilities that accommodate additional sequences, such as S-x-Q-x-x-D-E in some substrates. Such specificity has been mapped through extensive phosphoproteomic studies and in vitro kinase assays, with recent atlas studies of the human serine/threonine kinome further supporting that serine/threonine kinases like FAM20C preferentially target motifs that include acidic residues in the +1 (and sometimes further) positions (cui2015asecretorykinase pages 1-2, Johnson2023Nature pages 759-766). The atlas of substrate specificities for serine/threonine kinases provides a context in which FAM20C’s selective phosphorylation contributes to the generation of the majority of the extracellular phosphoproteome. For completeness in comparing substrate preferences, note that studies of tyrosine kinase specificity have shown distinct recognition patterns (Yaron-Barir2024Nature pages 1174-1181); however, FAM20C is categorized as a serine/threonine kinase.\n\n5. Structure  \nFAM20C features an atypical protein kinase domain that is embedded in a unique structural context. It is a type II transmembrane protein possessing an N-terminal hydrophobic transmembrane domain that functions as a Golgi retention signal, ensuring its localization in the Golgi apparatus (chen2021proteolyticprocessingof pages 1-2, ohyama2016fam20abindsto pages 1-2). The soluble portion, oriented towards the lumen of the secretory pathway, is composed of a central catalytic domain with a protein kinase-like fold. Structural studies, including the crystal structure of the Caenorhabditis elegans Fam20 ortholog, have revealed that this domain is organized into two lobes—an N-lobe and a C-lobe—with an insertion domain that forms a cap-like or shell-like structure over the active site (xiao2013crystalstructureof pages 1-3, xiao2013crystalstructureof pages 4-5). Key catalytic features include a conserved lysine critical for ATP binding, a variant DFG motif in which unique residues contribute to the catalytic and regulatory spine, and a lack of a typical activation loop, suggesting that FAM20C is constitutively competent for catalysis (cui2015asecretorykinase pages 4-6, tagliabracci2013phosphorylationofsubstrates pages 1-2). In addition, numerous disulfide bonds and N-linked glycosylation sites have been identified that support proper folding and stability of the secreted kinase (palmalara2021fam20coverviewclassic pages 2-4).\n\n6. Regulation  \nRegulation of FAM20C occurs at multiple levels. One key regulatory mechanism is the proteolytic processing by Site-1 Protease (S1P), a Golgi-resident subtilisin-like proprotein convertase that cleaves FAM20C’s propeptide, resulting in enhanced secretion and increased kinase activity. The uncleaved full-length protein displays lower basal activity and partially resides in the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby phosphorylating select substrates under stress conditions, whereas the mature, cleaved form is fully active in the secretory pathway (chen2021proteolyticprocessingof pages 8-10). Furthermore, FAM20C activity is subject to allosteric modulation via heterodimerization with its catalytically inactive paralog FAM20A. This interaction enhances FAM20C activity and directs its localization and secretion from the Golgi into the extracellular space (cui2015asecretorykinase pages 11-13, ohyama2016fam20abindsto pages 3-5). Additionally, sphingolipid signaling has been shown to modulate FAM20C’s catalytic efficiency, with sphingosine and related compounds acting as activators that increase the kinase’s activity in vitro (cozza2017fam20cisunder pages 12-15). These regulatory mechanisms ensure that FAM20C-mediated phosphorylation is tightly controlled to meet the demands of biomineralization, endoplasmic reticulum proteostasis, and extracellular matrix modification.\n\n7. Function  \nFAM20C plays a critical role as the primary kinase for extracellular proteins, thereby generating the majority of the secreted phosphoproteome. It phosphorylates key proteins involved in biomineralization, including milk proteins such as casein and secretory calcium-binding proteins such as amelogenin (AMELX), enamelin (ENAM), ameloblastin (AMBN), and osteopontin (SPP1/OPN). These phosphorylation events are essential for proper mineral deposition during bone and tooth formation and are critical for the differentiation of osteoblasts (chen2021proteolyticprocessingof pages 1-2, ishikawa2012therainesyndrome pages 1-2). Beyond its role in biomineralization, FAM20C phosphorylates endoplasmic reticulum proteins such as ERO1A; phosphorylation of ERO1A enhances its activity, supporting oxidative protein folding and redox homeostasis, whereas phosphorylation of P4HB/PDIA1 alters its functional state from an oxidoreductase to a chaperone during ER stress (cui2015asecretorykinase pages 4-6, palmalara2021fam20coverviewclassic pages 35-36). These modifications are critical under conditions of ER stress, ensuring proteostasis and cell survival. In addition, FAM20C activity influences lipid homeostasis, wound healing, and cell migration and adhesion, extending its functional impact beyond mineralized tissues (cui2015asecretorykinase pages 2-4, filatova2015theroleof pages 20-24). Expression patterns indicate that FAM20C is highly expressed in mineralizing tissues such as bones and teeth, as well as in the lactating mammary gland, which further supports its role in extracellular protein regulation and phosphoproteome generation (ishikawa2012therainesyndrome pages 9-10, zuo2021fam20cregulatesbone pages 1-1).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nFAM20C has been linked to several human diseases through loss-of-function mutations. Notably, pathogenic variants in FAM20C underlie Raine syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive osteosclerotic bone dysplasia characterized by severe mineralization defects, dental anomalies, and hypophosphatemia (ishikawa2012therainesyndrome pages 1-2, palmalara2021fam20coverviewclassic pages 35-36). In addition, deficiencies in FAM20C activity have been associated with non-lethal mineralization defects, including forms of hypophosphatemic rickets and amelogenesis imperfecta, which arise from defective phosphorylation of enamel matrix proteins (ravindran2015dentinmatrixproteins pages 14-19, vogel2012amelogenesisimperfectaand pages 1-2). Although specific small-molecule inhibitors for FAM20C have not been successfully developed, research into its regulation by sphingolipids (cozza2017fam20cisunder pages 12-15) and proteolytic processing by S1P (chen2021proteolyticprocessingof pages 8-10) provides potential therapeutic avenues. Its unique structure and regulation make it a promising target for interventions aimed at controlling extracellular phosphorylation in biomineralization and ER proteostasis.\n\n9.

In response to reduction of intracellular ATP levels, AMPK activates energy-producing pathways and inhibits energy-consuming processes: inhibits protein, carbohydrate and lipid biosynthesis, as well as cell growth and proliferation (PubMed:17307971, PubMed:17712357). AMPK acts via direct phosphorylation of metabolic enzymes, and by longer-term effects via phosphorylation of transcription regulators (PubMed:17307971, PubMed:17712357). Regulates lipid synthesis by phosphorylating and inactivating lipid metabolic enzymes such as ACACA, ACACB, GYS1, HMGCR and LIPE; regulates fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis by phosphorylating acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACACA and ACACB) and hormone-sensitive lipase (LIPE) enzymes, respectively (By similarity). Promotes lipolysis of lipid droplets by mediating phosphorylation of isoform 1 of CHKA (CHKalpha2) (PubMed:34077757). Regulates insulin-signaling and glycolysis by phosphorylating IRS1, PFKFB2 and PFKFB3 (By similarity). AMPK stimulates glucose uptake in muscle by increasing the translocation of the glucose transporter SLC2A4/GLUT4 to the plasma membrane, possibly by mediating phosphorylation of TBC1D4/AS160 (By similarity). Regulates transcription and chromatin structure by phosphorylating transcription regulators involved in energy metabolism such as CRTC2/TORC2, FOXO3, histone H2B, HDAC5, MEF2C, MLXIPL/ChREBP, EP300, HNF4A, p53/TP53, SREBF1, SREBF2 and PPARGC1A (PubMed:11518699, PubMed:11554766, PubMed:15866171, PubMed:17711846, PubMed:18184930). Acts as a key regulator of glucose homeostasis in liver by phosphorylating CRTC2/TORC2, leading to CRTC2/TORC2 sequestration in the cytoplasm (By similarity). In response to stress, phosphorylates 'Ser-36' of histone H2B (H2BS36ph), leading to promote transcription (By similarity). Acts as a key regulator of cell growth and proliferation by phosphorylating FNIP1, TSC2, RPTOR, WDR24 and ATG1/ULK1: in response to nutrient limitation, negatively regulates the mTORC1 complex by phosphorylating RPTOR component of the mTORC1 complex and by phosphorylating and activating TSC2 (PubMed:14651849, PubMed:18439900, PubMed:20160076, PubMed:21205641). Also phosphorylates and inhibits GATOR2 subunit WDR24 in response to nutrient limitation, leading to suppress glucose-mediated mTORC1 activation (PubMed:36732624). In response to energetic stress, phosphorylates FNIP1, inactivating the non-canonical mTORC1 signaling, thereby promoting nuclear translocation of TFEB and TFE3, and inducing transcription of lysosomal or autophagy genes (PubMed:37079666). In response to nutrient limitation, promotes autophagy by phosphorylating and activating ATG1/ULK1 (PubMed:21205641). In that process, it also activates WDR45/WIPI4 (PubMed:28561066). Phosphorylates CASP6, thereby preventing its autoprocessing and subsequent activation (PubMed:32029622). In response to nutrient limitation, phosphorylates transcription factor FOXO3 promoting FOXO3 mitochondrial import (By similarity). Also acts as a regulator of cellular polarity by remodeling the actin cytoskeleton; probably by indirectly activating myosin (PubMed:17486097). AMPK also acts as a regulator of circadian rhythm by mediating phosphorylation of CRY1, leading to destabilize it (By similarity). May regulate the Wnt signaling pathway by phosphorylating CTNNB1, leading to stabilize it (By similarity). Also has tau-protein kinase activity: in response to amyloid beta A4 protein (APP) exposure, activated by CAMKK2, leading to phosphorylation of MAPT/TAU; however the relevance of such data remains unclear in vivo (By similarity). Also phosphorylates CFTR, EEF2K, KLC1, NOS3 and SLC12A1 (PubMed:12519745, PubMed:20074060). Regulates hepatic lipogenesis. Activated via SIRT3, represses sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) transcriptional activities and ATP-consuming lipogenesis to restore cellular energy balance. Upon stress, regulates mitochondrial fragmentation through phosphorylation of MTFR1L (PubMed:36367943)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \n5′-AMP-activated protein kinase catalytic subunit alpha‑1 (PRKAA1, also known as AMPK1) is a highly evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine kinase found in all eukaryotes, from yeast to mammals. Its catalytic domain shares high sequence homology with the α subunit of the yeast SNF1 complex, indicating that the kinase originated early in eukaryotic evolution and has been maintained as part of an ancestral energy‐sensing module through the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or earlier (cox2003proteinkinasesand pages 53-57, hardie2007ampactivatedsnf1proteinkinases pages 1-2). Within the human kinome, in accordance with the classification by Manning and colleagues, PRKAA1 is grouped with the AMPK family, which forms an evolutionarily conserved regulatory branch distinct from other serine/threonine kinases. This subgroup is part of the metabolic regulatory core that includes kinases such as LKB1, AKT, and mTOR, whose functions are interlinked in energy homeostasis and nutrient signaling (hardie2007ampactivatedsnf1proteinkinases pages 1-2, cox2003proteinkinasesand pages 53-57). In mammals, AMPK exists as a heterotrimer composed of various isoforms of the catalytic (α1 and α2), regulatory β (β1 and β2), and γ (γ1, γ2, and γ3) subunits, and PRKAA1 encodes the predominant catalytic isoform present in many tissues such as liver, muscle, and brain. The conservation of these isoforms across species underscores the central role of AMPK in cellular energy sensing and metabolism regulation (hardie2007ampactivatedsnf1proteinkinases pages 1-2, cox2003proteinkinasesand pages 53-57).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nAMPKα1 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to specific serine/threonine residues on its target protein substrates. The canonical reaction can be represented as: ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺. This phosphorylation event is fundamental to switching various metabolic enzymes and regulatory proteins on or off, thereby modulating catabolic and anabolic processes in response to changes in cellular energy status (hardie2004ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 2-3, kemp2003ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 3-6).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of AMPKα1 is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions, predominantly Mg²⁺, which serve as essential cofactors for ATP binding and catalysis. In addition, the regulatory mechanism relies on binding of adenine nucleotides such as AMP (and to a lesser extent ADP) which promote allosteric activation and protect the activating phosphorylation site on the α subunit from dephosphorylation. The requirement for Mg²⁺ ensures proper alignment of ATP within the catalytic pocket and facilitates the transfer of the phosphate group during the phosphorylation reaction (hardie2004ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 2-3, russell2020ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 2-4).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nAMPKα1 preferentially phosphorylates serine or threonine residues within substrates that display specific consensus motifs. Detailed studies have indicated that the substrate motif often features hydrophobic residues at the –5 and +4 positions relative to the phosphoacceptor site, along with basic residues (typically arginine, lysine, or histidine) at positions such as –4 and –3. The resulting preferred sequence may be summarized as hyd-X-bas-XXSXXX-hyd (where “bas” represents a basic residue and “hyd” represents a hydrophobic residue) (cox2003proteinkinasesand pages 57-61). Recent phosphoproteomic studies on the human serine/threonine kinome corroborate that AMPK exhibits a distinct set of substrate preferences corresponding to these sequence features (Johnson2023Example pages 1-4). Although AMPK primarily functions as a serine/threonine kinase, its substrate specificity categorizes it within a broader class of kinases that includes enzymes with similar consensus motifs, ensuring that its targets encompass key metabolic enzymes such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase, hormone-sensitive lipase, and various transcription regulators (cox2003proteinkinasesand pages 57-61, michell1996isoformspecificpurificationand pages 3-4).\n\n5. Structure  \nThe structure of AMPKα1 is defined by a modular organization that includes an N-terminal serine/threonine kinase domain, an autoinhibitory domain (AID), and a C-terminal domain (CTD) responsible for interaction with regulatory subunits. The kinase domain comprises a two-lobed structure: a smaller N-terminal lobe containing β-sheets important for ATP binding and a larger C-terminal lobe that houses catalytic residues and the active site. Within this domain, the conserved activation loop contains threonine 172—a critical residue whose phosphorylation by upstream kinases is essential for full catalytic activation (hardie2004ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 2-3, hardie2007ampactivatedsnf1proteinkinases pages 3-4). The AID, located immediately C-terminal to the kinase domain, exerts an inhibitory effect in the absence of allosteric activators and is relieved upon AMP binding to the regulatory complex. The C-terminal region also mediates the interaction with the β and γ subunits, allowing the assembly of a heterotrimeric complex. Structural models and crystallographic data, including those derived from AlphaFold predictions, reveal a tight configuration of the catalytic domain along with a prominent hydrophobic spine and an appropriately positioned C-helix that play roles in substrate alignment and catalytic efficiency (hardie2007ampactivatedsnf1proteinkinases pages 3-4, witczak2008ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 3-4, russell2020ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 4-6). The overall three-dimensional conformation is critical for both the enzymatic function and the regulation by nucleotides, with the Bateman domains present in the γ subunit binding AMP/ADP and transmitting allosteric signals that modulate the conformation of the catalytic α subunit (witczak2008ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 4-6).\n\n6. Regulation  \nRegulation of AMPKα1 activity is achieved by a combination of post-translational modifications and allosteric mechanisms. One of the most critical regulatory events is the phosphorylation of Thr172 within the activation loop by upstream kinases such as LKB1 and CaMKKβ; this phosphorylation increases AMPK activity several hundred- to thousand-fold (hardie2007ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 1-3, hardie2011ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 3-4). AMP binding to the γ subunit of AMPK allosterically activates the enzyme, stimulates further phosphorylation of Thr172, and prevents its dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases (PP2C among others) (hardie2004ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 2-3, russell2020ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 23-24). In addition, regulatory phosphorylation at other serine residues (for example, serine 485 in the α1 isoform) has been reported to exert inhibitory effects, potentially mediated by kinases such as protein kinase B (PKB/Akt). These multiple layers of regulation, which include nucleotide binding, phosphorylation by specific upstream kinases, and protective interactions with regulatory subunits, enable AMPKα1 to function precisely as a sensor of cellular energy status (cox2003proteinkinasesand pages 61-64, hardie2007ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 1-3, hardie2011ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 3-4, russell2020ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 23-24).\n\n7. Function  \nAMPKα1 plays a central role in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis by modulating key metabolic pathways in response to changes in the intracellular energy charge. Under conditions of energy stress—such as hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, or muscle contraction—the intracellular concentration of AMP increases relative to ATP. This shift in the AMP:ATP ratio triggers the activation of AMPKα1, which in turn phosphorylates metabolic enzymes to inhibit ATP-consuming anabolic pathways, including fatty acid, cholesterol, protein, and carbohydrate synthesis (cox2003proteinkinasesand pages 53-57, hardie2007ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 1-3). Concurrently, AMPKα1 activation enhances ATP-generating catabolic processes such as fatty acid oxidation, glucose uptake, glycolysis, and autophagy. For instance, phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACACA and ACACB) by AMPK reduces malonyl-CoA levels, thereby removing the inhibition of mitochondrial fatty acid import and oxidation. In skeletal muscle, AMPK facilitates the translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 to the plasma membrane—via phosphorylation of proteins such as TBC1D4/AS160—thereby enhancing glucose uptake (cox2003proteinkinasesand pages 57-61, hardie2007ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 1-3, russell2020ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 2-4).  \nIn the liver, AMPKα1 phosphorylates regulatory proteins such as CRTC2/TORC2, causing its sequestration in the cytoplasm and leading to a reduction in gluconeogenic gene expression, thereby contributing to glucose homeostasis. AMPKα1 also modulates lipid metabolism by phosphorylating and inactivating enzymes involved in lipogenesis such as HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) and by promoting lipolysis through effects on hormone-sensitive lipase (LIPE) (cox2003proteinkinasesand pages 57-61, hardie2011ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 10-10, russell2020ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 23-24).  \nBeyond its immediate metabolic functions, AMPKα1 influences gene expression through phosphorylation of transcriptional regulators such as FOXO3, ChREBP, and p53, thereby integrating acute metabolic responses with longer-term transcriptional adaptations. It also plays a role in regulating cell growth and proliferation by impacting the mTORC1 pathway; for example, AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of TSC2 and the RPTOR subunit of mTORC1 results in suppression of anabolic and growth-promoting signals during energy stress (cox2003proteinkinasesand pages 61-64, hardie2011ampactivatedproteinkinase—an pages 4-5, russell2020ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 2-4). AMPKα1 is expressed ubiquitously, yet tissue-specific isoform distributions (for instance, a higher relative content of α1 in some tissues compared to α2) suggest differential roles in various cell types, such as skeletal muscle, liver, adipose tissue, and the brain (cox2003proteinkinasesand pages 53-57, hardie2007ampactivatedsnf1proteinkinases pages 1-2).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral pharmacological agents are known to modulate AMPK activity. Indirect activators such as metformin and AICAR have been employed extensively in both research and clinical settings to harness AMPK’s metabolic benefits in conditions like type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome by creating a cellular environment that mimics energy stress (russell2020ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 23-24, hardie2011ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 10-10). In addition, there are direct activators such as A-769662, which interact with regulatory subunits, and experimental inhibitors that have been used to study AMPK function. Inhibition of AMPK has also been associated with increased anabolic activity and cell proliferation in certain contexts, pointing to its potential role as a tumor suppressor. Alterations in AMPK signaling have been linked to a variety of disease states, including cardiac hypertrophy, insulin resistance, and even aspects of cancer progression via its actions on cell growth pathways. Notably, mutations affecting AMPK regulatory subunits (and by extension its activation) have been associated with disorders of glycogen storage and arrhythmias. AMPKα1 is also described to have tau-protein kinase activity in response to amyloid beta exposure; however, the in vivo relevance of this function remains to be fully clarified (cox2003proteinkinasesand pages 61-64, hardie2007ampactivatedsnf1proteinkinases pages 1-2, russell2020ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 23-24). The wide-ranging substrate portfolio of AMPKα1 includes transcription regulators, metabolic enzymes, and proteins involved in autophagy and mitophagy, which further emphasizes its role as a master regulator of cellular energy and homeostasis (steinberg2023newinsightsinto pages 9-13, hardie2011ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 10-10).\n\n9.

    "answer": "Question: # Information\n\n**Protein Name: Mitogen-activated protein kinase 11 / gene: MAPK11 PRKM11; SAPK2; SAPK2B**\n**Uniprot Id: Q15759**\n**Protein alternative names: Mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 beta; Stress-activated protein kinase 2b; p38-2**\n**Protein Function: Serine/threonine kinase which acts as an essential component of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway (PubMed:12452429, PubMed:20626350, PubMed:35857590). MAPK11 is one of the four p38 MAPKs which play an important role in the cascades of cellular responses evoked by extracellular stimuli such as pro-inflammatory cytokines or physical stress leading to direct activation of transcription factors (PubMed:12452429, PubMed:20626350, PubMed:35857590). Accordingly, p38 MAPKs phosphorylate a broad range of proteins and it has been estimated that they may have approximately 200 to 300 substrates each (PubMed:12452429, PubMed:20626350, PubMed:35857590). MAPK11 functions are mostly redundant with those of MAPK14 (PubMed:12452429, PubMed:20626350, PubMed:35857590). Some of the targets are downstream kinases which are activated through phosphorylation and further phosphorylate additional targets (PubMed:12452429, PubMed:20626350). RPS6KA5/MSK1 and RPS6KA4/MSK2 can directly phosphorylate and activate transcription factors such as CREB1, ATF1, the NF-kappa-B isoform RELA/NFKB3, STAT1 and STAT3, but can also phosphorylate histone H3 and the nucleosomal protein HMGN1 (PubMed:9687510). RPS6KA5/MSK1 and RPS6KA4/MSK2 play important roles in the rapid induction of immediate-early genes in response to stress or mitogenic stimuli, either by inducing chromatin remodeling or by recruiting the transcription machinery. On the other hand, two other kinase targets, MAPKAPK2/MK2 and MAPKAPK3/MK3, participate in the control of gene expression mostly at the post-transcriptional level, by phosphorylating ZFP36 (tristetraprolin) and ELAVL1, and by regulating EEF2K, which is important for the elongation of mRNA during translation. MKNK1/MNK1 and MKNK2/MNK2, two other kinases activated by p38 MAPKs, regulate protein synthesis by phosphorylating the initiation factor EIF4E2 (PubMed:11154262). In the cytoplasm, the p38 MAPK pathway is an important regulator of protein turnover. For example, CFLAR is an inhibitor of TNF-induced apoptosis whose proteasome-mediated degradation is regulated by p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Ectodomain shedding of transmembrane proteins is regulated by p38 MAPKs as well. In response to inflammatory stimuli, p38 MAPKs phosphorylate the membrane-associated metalloprotease ADAM17. Such phosphorylation is required for ADAM17-mediated ectodomain shedding of TGF-alpha family ligands, which results in the activation of EGFR signaling and cell proliferation. Additional examples of p38 MAPK substrates are the FGFR1. FGFR1 can be translocated from the extracellular space into the cytosol and nucleus of target cells, and regulates processes such as rRNA synthesis and cell growth. FGFR1 translocation requires p38 MAPK activation. In the nucleus, many transcription factors are phosphorylated and activated by p38 MAPKs in response to different stimuli. Classical examples include ATF1, ATF2, ATF6, ELK1, PTPRH, DDIT3, TP53/p53 and MEF2C and MEF2A (PubMed:10330143, PubMed:15356147, PubMed:9430721). The p38 MAPKs are emerging as important modulators of gene expression by regulating chromatin modifiers and remodelers (PubMed:10330143, PubMed:15356147, PubMed:9430721). The promoters of several genes involved in the inflammatory response, such as IL6, IL8 and IL12B, display a p38 MAPK-dependent enrichment of histone H3 phosphorylation on 'Ser-10' (H3S10ph) in LPS-stimulated myeloid cells. This phosphorylation enhances the accessibility of the cryptic NF-kappa-B-binding sites marking promoters for increased NF-kappa-B recruitment. Phosphorylates NLRP1 downstream of MAP3K20/ZAK in response to UV-B irradiation and ribosome collisions, promoting activation of the NLRP1 inflammasome and pyroptosis (PubMed:35857590). Phosphorylates methyltransferase DOT1L on 'Ser-834', 'Thr-900', 'Ser-902', 'Thr-984', 'Ser-1001', 'Ser-1009' and 'Ser-1104' (PubMed:38270553)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available. Resources that compare the efficacy of these and other compounds against a spectrum of protein kinases should be consulted,  including the Chemical Probes portal (https://www.chemicalprobes.org) supported by the Wellcome Trust, the MRC Kinase Inhibitor Database (www.kinase-screen.mrc.ac.uk/kinase-inhibitors), a resource curated by the NIH (https://pharos.nih.gov/), the protein kinase ontology database (http://prokino.uga.edu/), and the KLIFS (Kinase–Ligand Interaction Fingerprints and Structures) database (https://klifs.net). \n\n\n**Other comments**:\n....\n\n**References**:\n1. ...\n2. ...\n\n\"\"\"\n\n---\n\n# Section Guidelines\n\nFollow the **section numbers and headings** below exactly.

Phylogeny:  \nMitogen‐activated protein kinase 11 (MAPK11), also known as p38 beta, belongs to the p38 MAPK subfamily of the larger MAP kinase superfamily. It is evolutionarily related to p38α (MAPK14), p38γ (MAPK12) and p38δ (MAPK13), with p38β sharing approximately 70–75% sequence homology with p38α and more limited differences with the other isoforms, features that are conserved across mammals and other eukaryotes (martinblanco2000p38mapksignalling pages 1-2, cuadrado2010mechanismsandfunctions pages 1-2). Evolutionary studies trace the origin of the p38 subfamily to ancestral stress‐activated protein kinases present in early eukaryotes; the kinase complement of the human genome, as characterized by Manning et al. (2002) in both Science and Trends in Biochemical Sciences, places MAPK11 within the conserved core of kinases that emerged in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (kultz1998phylogeneticandfunctional pages 1-2, kultz1998phylogeneticandfunctional pages 15-17, Manning2002). Orthologous sequences for MAPK11 are found in a wide range of species, with gene duplication events and subsequent functional divergence leading to isoform‐specific roles in mammalian stress and inflammatory pathways (burton2021atypicalp38signaling pages 2-4, new1998thep38map pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed:  \nMAPK11 functions as a serine/threonine protein kinase that catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine/threonine residues in target substrates. The general reaction can be represented as ATP + [protein]–(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]–(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (coulthard2009p38mapkstressresponses pages 1-2, zarubin2005activationandsignaling pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements:  \nThe catalytic activity of MAPK11 is dependent on the presence of divalent cations, specifically Mg²⁺, which acts as a cofactor required to assist in the binding of ATP to the kinase and proper orientation for phosphoryl transfer (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 1-1, new1998thep38map pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity:  \nMAPK11, as a serine/threonine kinase, exhibits substrate specificity that is determined by consensus motifs present in its target proteins. According to recent high-throughput investigations of serine/threonine kinase substrate recognition, the p38 MAPK family generally phosphorylates substrates that present a proline-directed motif, typically of the form –[pS/pT]P–, although broader sequence contexts may be important for substrate recognition. In particular, p38 MAPKs have been reported to target transcription factors, regulatory kinases, and other signaling molecules involved in inflammatory responses and stress signaling (Johnson2023Atlas pages 759-766, cuadrado2010mechanismsandfunctions pages 14-15). Experimental evidence also shows that MAPK11 phosphorylates a broad range of substrates—approximated at 200 to 300 possible targets—which include downstream kinases such as MAPKAPK2/MK2 and MAPKAPK3/MK3, transcription factors like ATF1, ATF2 and CREB1, as well as proteins involved in mRNA translation and chromatin remodeling (burton2021atypicalp38signaling pages 15-17, martinezlimon2020thep38pathway pages 1-3).\n\n5. Structure:  \nMAPK11 possesses the canonical kinase domain found in MAPKs, consisting of a small N-terminal lobe primarily composed of β-sheets and a larger C-terminal lobe predominantly helical in nature (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 1-1, peti2013molecularbasisof pages 11-12). The kinase domain encloses the ATP-binding pocket located in the cleft between the two lobes. Key features include the dual phosphorylation activation loop, which contains the conserved Thr–Gly–Tyr (TGY) motif (typically at residues 180–182) that is essential for catalytic activation (burton2021atypicalp38signaling pages 15-17, cuenda2007p38mapkinasespathway pages 1-2). The structure reveals a well-defined C-helix that is critical for the alignment of catalytic residues and the hydrophobic spine that maintains the structural integrity of the active conformation. In addition, the kinase possesses docking grooves that enable interactions with upstream activators (such as MKK3/MKK6) and substrates; these structural elements are vital for substrate specificity and regulatory protein binding (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 4-5, martinblanco2000p38mapksignalling pages 1-2). Some structural studies have noted that p38β has a subtly smaller ATP-binding pocket compared to p38α, a feature that can potentially be exploited for selective inhibitor design (roche2020p38βandcancer pages 8-10, schindler2007p38pathwaykinases pages 5-6).\n\n6. Regulation:  \nActivation of MAPK11 is mediated primarily by dual phosphorylation on its TGY motif; the upstream kinases MKK3 and MKK6 are responsible for these phosphorylation events, which result in alignment of catalytic residues and full activation of the kinase (cuadrado2010mechanismsandfunctions pages 1-2, zarubin2005activationandsignaling pages 1-2). Other regulatory mechanisms include transient interactions with scaffold proteins that spatially organize the kinase with its activators and substrates, thereby modulating signal amplitude and duration (burton2021atypicalp38signaling pages 2-4, coulthard2009p38mapkstressresponses pages 1-2). In addition, MAPK11 activity is modulated by dephosphorylation through dual-specificity phosphatases such as members of the MKP family, which remove phosphate groups from the activation loop to return the kinase to an inactive state (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 1-2, cuadrado2010mechanismsandfunctions pages 11-11). While ubiquitination and other post-translational modifications have been mentioned for atypical regulatory mechanisms in the p38 pathway, detailed mechanistic insights specific to MAPK11 remain less extensively characterized (burton2021atypicalp38signaling pages 15-17, schindler2007p38pathwaykinases pages 5-6).\n\n7. Function:  \nMAPK11 is an important mediator in the MAPK signal transduction cascade, predominantly activated in response to extracellular stresses such as pro-inflammatory cytokines and physical stress stimuli. Its activity results in the phosphorylation of a broad array of substrates that include downstream kinases (e.g., MAPKAPK2/MK2, MSK1/MSK2, MNK1/MNK2), transcription factors (e.g., ATF1, ATF2, CREB1, NF-κB subunits) and other proteins involved in chromatin remodeling, mRNA stability and protein turnover (burton2021atypicalp38signaling pages 15-17, martinezlimon2020thep38pathway pages 1-3). In the nucleus, MAPK11 contributes to regulation of gene expression via phosphorylation of transcription factors and chromatin modifiers, thereby affecting immediate-early gene induction in response to stress (cuadrado2010mechanismsandfunctions pages 14-15, maikrachline2020nuclearp38roles pages 4-6). In the cytosol, it regulates processes such as mRNA translation, protein turnover—by influencing the proteasome pathway—and ectodomain shedding of membrane proteins through phosphorylation of enzymes such as ADAM17 (burton2021atypicalp38signaling pages 15-17, zarubin2005activationandsignaling pages 1-2). Although some functional roles of MAPK11 show redundancy with those of MAPK14 (p38α), differential expression patterns – with MAPK11 being predominantly expressed in select tissues such as the brain – suggest tissue-specific roles in inflammation, cell cycle control, and stress responses (coulthard2009p38mapkstressresponses pages 1-2, rock2020p38βandcancer pages 8-10).\n\n8. Other Comments:  \nMAPK11 has been the target of several small-molecule inhibitors, many of which were initially developed as p38 inhibitors with overlapping activity against p38α and p38β. These include pyridinyl imidazole compounds such as SB203580 that compete for the ATP-binding site, although selectivity for p38β over p38α remains a challenge due to high sequence similarity in the catalytic domains (clark2007potentialofp38mapk pages 4-5, roche2020p38βandcancer pages 8-10). Disease associations for MAPK11 primarily involve inflammatory disorders, with the p38 MAPK pathway being implicated in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and various stress-related pathologies. In addition, emerging evidence links p38β to processes involved in cancer progression, where its differential expression may influence tumor proliferation, apoptosis, and immune responses (roche2020p38βandcancer pages 13-14, martinezlimon2020thep38pathway pages 1-3). Known inhibitors targeting p38 kinases continue to be evaluated in preclinical and clinical settings in an effort to modulate inflammatory responses and other pathophysiological processes (marber2011thep38mitogenactivated pages 6-8, ganguly2023revisitingp38mitogenactivated pages 1-3).  \nFor substrate specificity data on serine/threonine kinases, recent atlas studies provide detailed motif preferences and contribute to our understanding of MAPK11’s broad substrate range (Johnson2023Atlas pages 759-766). For phylogenetic context, seminal works by Manning et al. (Manning2002) provide the foundation for kinase classification and evolutionary relationships among MAPK family members. For tyrosine kinases, which are not the focus for MAPK11, the intrinsic specificity has been delineated in separate studies (Yaron-Barir2024).  \n\n9.

MAPK12 is one of the four p38 MAPKs which play an important role in the cascades of cellular responses evoked by extracellular stimuli such as pro-inflammatory cytokines or physical stress leading to direct activation of transcription factors such as ELK1 and ATF2. Accordingly, p38 MAPKs phosphorylate a broad range of proteins and it has been estimated that they may have approximately 200 to 300 substrates each. Some of the targets are downstream kinases such as MAPKAPK2, which are activated through phosphorylation and further phosphorylate additional targets. Plays a role in myoblast differentiation and also in the down-regulation of cyclin D1 in response to hypoxia in adrenal cells suggesting MAPK12 may inhibit cell proliferation while promoting differentiation. Phosphorylates DLG1. Following osmotic shock, MAPK12 in the cell nucleus increases its association with nuclear DLG1, thereby causing dissociation of DLG1-SFPQ complexes. This function is independent of its catalytic activity and could affect mRNA processing and/or gene transcription to aid cell adaptation to osmolarity changes in the environment. Regulates UV-induced checkpoint signaling and repair of UV-induced DNA damage and G2 arrest after gamma-radiation exposure. MAPK12 is involved in the regulation of SLC2A1 expression and basal glucose uptake in L6 myotubes; and negatively regulates SLC2A4 expression and contraction-mediated glucose uptake in adult skeletal muscle. C-Jun (JUN) phosphorylation is stimulated by MAPK14 and inhibited by MAPK12, leading to a distinct AP-1 regulation. MAPK12 is required for the normal kinetochore localization of PLK1, prevents chromosomal instability and supports mitotic cell viability. MAPK12-signaling is also positively regulating the expansion of transient amplifying myogenic precursor cells during muscle growth and regeneration**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nMAPK12, also known as ERK6, p38 γ, and SAPK3, belongs to the p38 mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) subfamily, which is one of several MAPK groups within the larger eukaryotic protein kinase superfamily (kyriakis2012mammalianmapksignal pages 2-3). Orthologs of MAPK12 have been identified across vertebrate species, and its evolutionary conservation is evident when compared with other members of the p38 family, namely p38α (MAPK14), p38β (MAPK11), and p38δ (MAPK13) (li2011evolutionaryhistoryof pages 1-2). In addition, phylogenetic analysis based on kinase domain sequences demonstrates that MAPK12 clusters tightly with MAPK11, MAPK13, and MAPK14 in the p38 subgroup, a grouping that has arisen from ancient gene duplication events and has been maintained throughout vertebrate evolution (li2011evolutionaryhistoryof pages 4-5). This grouping places MAPK12 within the CMGC group, which encompasses cyclin‐dependent kinases (CDKs), MAPKs, glycogen synthase kinases (GSKs) and CDC-like kinases (CLKs), thereby tracing its lineage back to early eukaryotic ancestors (kang to core phylogenetic classification as shown by Manning and colleagues, though the focus here is on the data provided in the context) (kyriakis2012mammalianmapksignal pages 2-3). Moreover, additional evidence from evolutionary studies in both vertebrates and invertebrates underscores that MAPK12 arises from a segmental duplication of a common ancestral gene, sharing strong synteny with MAPK11—which is consistent with its current classification as one of the p38 MAPKs (li2011evolutionaryhistoryof pages 2-4, li2011evolutionaryhistoryof pages 8-11).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nThe catalytic activity of MAPK12 is defined by its ability to mediate the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to serine and/or threonine residues on substrate proteins. The chemical reaction can be summarized as follows:  \nATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (roux2004erkandp38 pages 1-1). This reaction is fundamental to its role in signal transduction, as the phosphorylation of target proteins modulates their activity and downstream cellular processes (roux2004erkandp38 pages 2-3).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nMAPK12 requires divalent metal ions as cofactors for its kinase activity. Specifically, magnesium ions (Mg²⁺) are needed to coordinate ATP binding and facilitate the phosphoryl transfer reaction during catalysis (coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nMAPK12, as a serine/threonine kinase, phosphorylates substrates on serine or threonine residues that are typically followed by a proline residue, yielding a consensus recognition motif of [S/T]-P (Johnson2023atlas pages 759-766). Detailed substrate specificity studies of the human serine/threonine kinome have established that many MAPKs, including those in the p38 family, show preference for substrates that harbor basic residues or specific docking motifs adjacent to the phosphorylation site (Johnson2023atlas pages 759-766). Although the intrinsic substrate specificity of MAPK12 has been characterized to some extent by its ability to phosphorylate nearly 200 to 300 distinct targets—including downstream kinases such as MAPKAPK2, transcription factors like ATF2 and ELK1, and proteins with PDZ domains such as DLG1—its substrate recognition generally conforms to the paradigm of a serine/threonine followed by a proline, with additional substrate affinity conferred by docking interactions mediated by specialized regions of the kinase (Yaron-Barir2024pages 1174-1181).\n\n5. Structure  \nMAPK12 exhibits a bilobed structure that is typical of eukaryotic protein kinases, comprising an N-terminal lobe primarily responsible for ATP binding and a C-terminal lobe that contains the substrate binding site (aoto2019adynamicswitch pages 1-6). The kinase domain features a conserved activation loop which contains the dual phosphorylation motif, typically represented as T-G-Y; phosphorylation at these residues induces conformational changes that are essential for full catalytic activity (aoto2019adynamicswitch pages 32-37, cuadrado2010mechanismsandfunctions pages 2-3). Key structural features include the hydrophobic regulatory spine (R-spine), which consists of residues from both lobes and is critical for maintaining the kinase in an active-like conformation, and a repositioned αC helix that forms an essential salt bridge often found in the active conformation of MAPKs (aoto2019adynamicswitch pages 1-6, rizco2012newinsightsinto pages 1-2). Furthermore, MAPK12 possesses a unique short C-terminal sequence that functions as a PDZ-binding domain, distinguishing it from other p38 isoforms and allowing interaction with proteins such as DLG1 (risco2012newinsightsinto pages 5-6, shabardina2023evolutionaryanalysisof pages 6-7). This domain organization, in which the central catalytic core is flanked by regulatory regions, permits both conventional activation by upstream kinases via dual phosphorylation and non-catalytic functions mediated by protein-protein interactions.\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe activity of MAPK12 is tightly controlled by several post-translational modifications and regulatory mechanisms. Dual phosphorylation within the activation loop, occurring at the threonine and tyrosine residues (typically T180 and Y182), is carried out by upstream MAP kinase kinases such as MKK3 and MKK6; this phosphorylation is essential for relieving autoinhibition and promoting a catalytically competent conformation (kyriakis2012mammalianmapksignal pages 2-3, raman2007differentialregulationand pages 7-8). In addition to phosphorylation, the intrinsic conformational dynamics of the protein—evidenced by the presence of multiple conformational states in crystal structures and solution studies—play a role in its regulation, with transitions between open (inactive) and compact (active-like) states modulated by the phosphorylation status of the activation loop (aoto2019adynamicswitch pages 1-6). Further regulatory control is achieved via docking interactions; the unique PDZ-binding motif at its C-terminus mediates interactions with regulatory and scaffold proteins such as DLG1 and PTPH1, which can modulate both its localization and substrate accessibility (risco2012newinsightsinto pages 5-6, shabardina2023evolutionaryanalysisof pages 5-6). This multifaceted regulation, combining phosphorylation, conformational changes, and docking-mediated interactions, ensures that MAPK12 activity is precisely integrated into cellular stress and differentiation signaling pathways (raman2007differentialregulationand pages 6-7).\n\n7. Function  \nMAPK12 plays a central role as an effector in the p38 MAPK signaling cascade, which is activated by extracellular stimuli including pro-inflammatory cytokines, physical stress, and osmotic shock (kyriakis2012mammalianmapksignal pages 2-3, han2020anoverviewof pages 1-3). It is involved in the direct phosphorylation and activation or inhibition of a broad array of substrates—approximately 200 to 300—spanning downstream kinases, transcription factors, and components of cell cycle regulation. In skeletal muscle, MAPK12 is highly expressed and contributes to myoblast differentiation and muscle regeneration through phosphorylation of key transcription factors and regulatory proteins, such as promoting the appropriate timing of myogenin expression during myogenesis (risco2012newinsightsinto pages 5-6, ng2024roleofmitogenactivated pages 5-6). In addition, MAPK12 is implicated in the cellular response to hypoxic stress in adrenal cells by down-regulating cyclin D1, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation while promoting differentiation (raman2007differentialregulationand pages 7-8). MAPK12 also plays a role in the regulation of glucose transporter expression, affecting basal glucose uptake in muscle cells, and modulates UV-induced checkpoint signaling by participating in the repair of UV-induced DNA damage and G2 cell cycle arrest following gamma-irradiation (Information). Its activity influences the localization of mitotic proteins such as PLK1 at kinetochores, ultimately contributing to chromosomal stability and proper mitotic progression (Information). Furthermore, MAPK12 can regulate the activity of transcription factors like ELK1 and ATF2, thereby mediating changes in gene expression in response to stress signals (Information). Collectively, these functions underscore the importance of MAPK12 in stress response, muscle differentiation, cell cycle regulation, and metabolic control (Information, risiko2012newinsightsinto pages 5-6).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral selective inhibitors have been developed that target p38 MAPK isoforms, with some compounds demonstrating selectivity based on differences in the gatekeeper residue within the ATP-binding pocket; for MAPK12, the presence of a methionine residue is noted to influence inhibitor binding, as mutations of this residue reduce sensitivity to certain inhibitors (anton2021aspecialview pages 10-12, raman2007differentialregulationand pages 7-8). Although direct inhibitors of MAPK12 are less well characterized relative to those for p38α and p38β, this isoform’s unique regulatory features, including its PDZ-binding domain and differential phosphorylation patterns, continue to make it an attractive target for further pharmacological intervention, particularly in contexts such as skeletal muscle disorders and certain cancers where MAPK12 expression is dysregulated (rouche2020p38βandcancer pages 8-10). Additionally, disease-associated alterations in the regulation and expression of MAPK12 have been documented; these include its involvement in stress-induced cell cycle arrest and its modulation of transcription factor activity, which may have implications in oncogenesis and metabolic diseases (Information, raman2007differentialregulationand pages 7-8). Resources and databases such as the Chemical Probes portal, the MRC Kinase Inhibitor Database, and the KLIFS database are recommended for comparative analysis of kinase inhibitor efficacy and specificity (anton2021aspecialview pages 10-12).\n\n9.

MAPK13 is one of the four p38 MAPKs which play an important role in the cascades of cellular responses evoked by extracellular stimuli such as pro-inflammatory cytokines or physical stress leading to direct activation of transcription factors such as ELK1 and ATF2. Accordingly, p38 MAPKs phosphorylate a broad range of proteins and it has been estimated that they may have approximately 200 to 300 substrates each. MAPK13 is one of the less studied p38 MAPK isoforms. Some of the targets are downstream kinases such as MAPKAPK2, which are activated through phosphorylation and further phosphorylate additional targets. Plays a role in the regulation of protein translation by phosphorylating and inactivating EEF2K. Involved in cytoskeletal remodeling through phosphorylation of MAPT and STMN1. Mediates UV irradiation induced up-regulation of the gene expression of CXCL14. Plays an important role in the regulation of epidermal keratinocyte differentiation, apoptosis and skin tumor development. Phosphorylates the transcriptional activator MYB in response to stress which leads to rapid MYB degradation via a proteasome-dependent pathway. MAPK13 also phosphorylates and down-regulates PRKD1 during regulation of insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nMAPK13, also known as mitogen‐activated protein kinase p38 delta or stress‐activated protein kinase 4 (SAPK4), is a member of the p38 mitogen‐activated protein kinase subgroup within the larger CMGC group of serine/threonine kinases. The p38 MAPK subfamily is composed of four distinct isoforms: p38α (MAPK14), p38β (MAPK11), p38γ (MAPK12), and p38δ (MAPK13). Phylogenetic studies based on comprehensive analyses of the human kinome demonstrate that all p38 isoforms share a conserved kinase domain and arose through gene duplication events early in vertebrate evolution, with orthologs of MAPK13 being detectable in a wide range of metazoans (johnson2023anatlasof pages 1-2, halwachs2023modulationofhuman pages 1-3). In addition, foundational works on kinase evolution by Manning and colleagues have established that protein kinase signaling is deeply conserved from yeast to man, placing MAPK13 within an evolutionary framework characterized by a highly preserved catalytic core and regulatory elements that have persisted to support stress‐responsive signaling (johnson2023anatlasof pages 1-2, cuadrado2010mechanismsandfunctions pages 1-1).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nMAPK13 catalyzes the phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues on substrate proteins. The chemical reaction it mediates involves the transfer of the γ-phosphate group from ATP to a hydroxyl group on a serine or threonine residue. Formally, this reaction can be represented as:  \nATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺  \nThis reaction has been consistently described in the literature as the key catalytic function of serine/threonine kinases including MAPK13 (darabedian2023depletionofcreatine pages 9-11, li2011dialkynylimidazolesasirreversible pages 13-19).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of MAPK13 requires the presence of divalent metal ion cofactors, with Mg²⁺ being critical for its catalytic function. Mg²⁺ ions are essential because they help coordinate the binding of ATP within the kinase active site, thus facilitating the effective transfer of the phosphate group to the substrate. This cofactor requirement is characteristic of serine/threonine kinases, and experimental evidence supports that in MAPK13 the catalytic efficiency is dependent on the availability of Mg²⁺ (halwachs2023modulationofhuman pages 1-3, li2023highthroughputprofilingof pages 39-40).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nMAPK13 displays substrate specificity that aligns with the proline-directed motif characteristic of the p38 MAPK family. Detailed substrate profiling using high-throughput methods has established that MAPK13 preferentially phosphorylates serine or threonine residues when they are immediately followed by a proline residue; this minimal consensus motif is typically represented as [pS/pT]P. Moreover, further analysis of the surrounding amino acid context reveals that additional flanking residues can modulate substrate affinity and contribute to a broader specificity profile. For instance, substrates including downstream kinases such as MAPKAPK2, translational regulators such as EEF2K, and cytoskeletal components including MAPT (tau protein) and STMN1 have been documented as targets. Transcription factors such as ELK1 and ATF2 also fall within the spectrum of MAPK13 substrates, underscoring a broad substrate range with estimates that the isoform may phosphorylate between 200 and 300 distinct proteins (johnson2023anatlasof pages 4-5, li2023highthroughputprofilingof pages 39-40, biswas2024theprospectof pages 1-2, halwachs2023modulationofhuman pages 3-5).\n\n5. Structure  \nThe three-dimensional structure of MAPK13 conforms to the canonical bilobal kinase fold found in MAP kinases. The N-terminal lobe is primarily constructed of β-sheets and contains the ATP-binding pocket, while the larger C-terminal lobe is mainly α-helical and comprises the substrate binding groove. A defining feature is the activation loop, which contains the conserved dual phosphorylation motif (Thr-Gly-Tyr, abbreviated as TGY) that is essential for proper catalytic activation. Within the catalytic cleft, the conserved HRD motif located in the catalytic loop and the DFG motif, positioned at the beginning of the activation segment, contribute to the coordination of Mg²⁺ ions and ATP binding (halwachs2023modulationofhuman pages 5-7, johnson2023anatlasof pages 7-7, li2011dialkynylimidazolesasirreversible pages 39-42). Furthermore, the regulatory C-helix plays a crucial role in aligning key catalytic residues and ensuring the proper orientation of ATP, while a hydrophobic spine provides structural stabilization in the active conformation. High-confidence structural models from AlphaFold along with comparative crystallography of related p38 MAPK isoforms support this conserved organization and indicate that although MAPK13 does not possess unique structural domains beyond those commonly found among p38 isoforms, slight variations in surface-exposed residues may confer isoform-specific substrate interactions (johnson2023anatlasof pages 7-7, maeda2025detectingproteinhigherorder pages 13-15, li2011dialkynylimidazolesasirreversible pages 39-42).\n\n6. Regulation  \nMAPK13 is subject to tight regulatory control that is mediated primarily via post-translational modifications. The most pivotal regulatory mechanism is dual phosphorylation of its activation loop at the threonine and tyrosine residues within the TGY motif, a process carried out by upstream MAP kinase kinases (MKKs) such as MKK3 and MKK6. This dual phosphorylation reaction induces significant conformational changes within the kinase domain, transitioning MAPK13 from an inactive to an active state and permitting substrate binding (halwachs2023modulationofhuman pages 16-18, samadani2015abstract3705overcoming pages 15-21). In addition to phosphorylation, regulatory mechanisms include ubiquitination events that target specific substrates such as the transcription factor MYB for proteasomal degradation, thereby modulating downstream signal duration. Scaffold proteins also contribute to the spatial and temporal regulation of MAPK13 by organizing multicomponent signaling complexes. Such regulation ensures that MAPK13 activity is responsive to extracellular stress cues, including those generated by inflammatory cytokines and physical stressors like UV irradiation (halwachs2023modulationofhuman pages 21-25, samadani2015abstract3705overcoming pages 21-26).\n\n7. Function  \nMAPK13 serves as an essential signal transducer within the MAP kinase cascade that is activated by diverse extracellular stress signals, including pro-inflammatory cytokines and physical insults such as UV irradiation. Upon activation, MAPK13 phosphorylates a wide array of substrates that span several critical cellular processes. It directly activates downstream kinases such as MAPKAPK2, which in turn propagate phosphorylation cascades that modulate additional cellular functions (johnson2023anatlasof pages 9-10, samadani2015abstract3705overcoming pages 15-21). In the realm of protein translation regulation, MAPK13 phosphorylates and inactivates EEF2 kinase (EEF2K), thereby directly influencing the protein synthesis machinery. It also plays a crucial role in cytoskeletal remodeling through the phosphorylation of microtubule-associated proteins such as MAPT and the microtubule-destabilizing protein STMN1. In terms of gene regulation, MAPK13 phosphorylates key transcription factors, including ELK1 and ATF2, and it promotes the proteasome-dependent degradation of the transcriptional activator MYB in response to stress. Additionally, in epidermal tissues, MAPK13 is involved in the regulation of keratinocyte differentiation and apoptosis, processes that are paramount in skin homeostasis and tumorigenesis. Beyond these roles, MAPK13 participates in metabolic regulation by phosphorylating and down-regulating PRKD1, a mechanism that is critical during insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells. The breadth of these functions emphasizes the role of MAPK13 as a central node in stress response and inflammatory signaling pathways (johnson2023anatlasof pages 4-4, samadani2015abstract3705overcoming pages 21-26, varun2023rohitukinecontentacross pages 15-16).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nAlthough MAPK13 is one of the less extensively studied isoforms within the p38 MAPK family, its distinctive substrate profile and regulation underscore its significance in several pathophysiological conditions. Owing to its involvement in inflammation, skin tumor development, and insulin secretion, there is a growing interest in developing specific inhibitors that can selectively target MAPK13. Currently, while several p38 MAPK inhibitors exist that affect multiple isoforms, isoform-specific inhibitors for MAPK13 remain under development due to the challenges posed by the conserved ATP-binding site among p38 family members. The potential therapeutic benefit of such inhibitors is highlighted by studies reporting improved control over cellular stress responses and inflammatory cascades when MAPK13 activity is modulated (higgins2023sarscov2hijacksp38βmapk11 pages 21-23, o’callaghan2014p38δmapkemerging pages 2-3). Moreover, substrate-based inhibitor design approaches have been proposed as an avenue to overcome the limitations inherent in ATP-competitive inhibitors, offering the promise of enhanced selectivity and reduced resistance. This is particularly relevant in contexts such as cancer and metabolic diseases, where dysregulation of MAPK13 has been implicated. No specific disease mutations have been consistently documented for MAPK13; however, its aberrant regulation is associated with conditions such as skin tumorigenesis and impaired insulin secretion, making it a candidate for diagnostic marker development and targeted therapy (biswas2024theprospectof pages 1-2, samadani2015abstract3705overcoming pages 26-31).\n\n9.

MAPK14 is one of the four p38 MAPKs which play an important role in the cascades of cellular responses evoked by extracellular stimuli such as pro-inflammatory cytokines or physical stress leading to direct activation of transcription factors. Accordingly, p38 MAPKs phosphorylate a broad range of proteins and it has been estimated that they may have approximately 200 to 300 substrates each. Some of the targets are downstream kinases which are activated through phosphorylation and further phosphorylate additional targets. RPS6KA5/MSK1 and RPS6KA4/MSK2 can directly phosphorylate and activate transcription factors such as CREB1, ATF1, the NF-kappa-B isoform RELA/NFKB3, STAT1 and STAT3, but can also phosphorylate histone H3 and the nucleosomal protein HMGN1 (PubMed:9687510, PubMed:9792677). RPS6KA5/MSK1 and RPS6KA4/MSK2 play important roles in the rapid induction of immediate-early genes in response to stress or mitogenic stimuli, either by inducing chromatin remodeling or by recruiting the transcription machinery (PubMed:9687510, PubMed:9792677). On the other hand, two other kinase targets, MAPKAPK2/MK2 and MAPKAPK3/MK3, participate in the control of gene expression mostly at the post-transcriptional level, by phosphorylating ZFP36 (tristetraprolin) and ELAVL1, and by regulating EEF2K, which is important for the elongation of mRNA during translation. MKNK1/MNK1 and MKNK2/MNK2, two other kinases activated by p38 MAPKs, regulate protein synthesis by phosphorylating the initiation factor EIF4E2 (PubMed:11154262). MAPK14 also interacts with casein kinase II, leading to its activation through autophosphorylation and further phosphorylation of TP53/p53 (PubMed:10747897). In the cytoplasm, the p38 MAPK pathway is an important regulator of protein turnover. For example, CFLAR is an inhibitor of TNF-induced apoptosis whose proteasome-mediated degradation is regulated by p38 MAPK phosphorylation. In a similar way, MAPK14 phosphorylates the ubiquitin ligase SIAH2, regulating its activity towards EGLN3 (PubMed:17003045). MAPK14 may also inhibit the lysosomal degradation pathway of autophagy by interfering with the intracellular trafficking of the transmembrane protein ATG9 (PubMed:19893488). Another function of MAPK14 is to regulate the endocytosis of membrane receptors by different mechanisms that impinge on the small GTPase RAB5A. In addition, clathrin-mediated EGFR internalization induced by inflammatory cytokines and UV irradiation depends on MAPK14-mediated phosphorylation of EGFR itself as well as of RAB5A effectors (PubMed:16932740). Ectodomain shedding of transmembrane proteins is regulated by p38 MAPKs as well. In response to inflammatory stimuli, p38 MAPKs phosphorylate the membrane-associated metalloprotease ADAM17 (PubMed:20188673). Such phosphorylation is required for ADAM17-mediated ectodomain shedding of TGF-alpha family ligands, which results in the activation of EGFR signaling and cell proliferation. Another p38 MAPK substrate is FGFR1. FGFR1 can be translocated from the extracellular space into the cytosol and nucleus of target cells, and regulates processes such as rRNA synthesis and cell growth. FGFR1 translocation requires p38 MAPK activation. In the nucleus, many transcription factors are phosphorylated and activated by p38 MAPKs in response to different stimuli. Classical examples include ATF1, ATF2, ATF6, ELK1, PTPRH, DDIT3, TP53/p53 and MEF2C and MEF2A (PubMed:10330143, PubMed:9430721, PubMed:9858528). The p38 MAPKs are emerging as important modulators of gene expression by regulating chromatin modifiers and remodelers. The promoters of several genes involved in the inflammatory response, such as IL6, IL8 and IL12B, display a p38 MAPK-dependent enrichment of histone H3 phosphorylation on 'Ser-10' (H3S10ph) in LPS-stimulated myeloid cells. This phosphorylation enhances the accessibility of the cryptic NF-kappa-B-binding sites marking promoters for increased NF-kappa-B recruitment. Phosphorylates CDC25B and CDC25C which is required for binding to 14-3-3 proteins and leads to initiation of a G2 delay after ultraviolet radiation (PubMed:11333986). Phosphorylates TIAR following DNA damage, releasing TIAR from GADD45A mRNA and preventing mRNA degradation (PubMed:20932473). The p38 MAPKs may also have kinase-independent roles, which are thought to be due to the binding to targets in the absence of phosphorylation. Protein O-Glc-N-acylation catalyzed by the OGT is regulated by MAPK14, and, although OGT does not seem to be phosphorylated by MAPK14, their interaction increases upon MAPK14 activation induced by glucose deprivation. This interaction may regulate OGT activity by recruiting it to specific targets such as neurofilament H, stimulating its O-Glc-N-acylation. Required in mid-fetal development for the growth of embryo-derived blood vessels in the labyrinth layer of the placenta. Also plays an essential role in developmental and stress-induced erythropoiesis, through regulation of EPO gene expression (PubMed:10943842). Isoform MXI2 activation is stimulated by mitogens and oxidative stress and only poorly phosphorylates ELK1 and ATF2. Isoform EXIP may play a role in the early onset of apoptosis. Phosphorylates S100A9 at 'Thr-113' (PubMed:15905572). Phosphorylates NLRP1 downstream of MAP3K20/ZAK in response to UV-B irradiation and ribosome collisions, promoting activation of the NLRP1 inflammasome and pyroptosis (PubMed:35857590)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny – MAPK14, commonly known as p38α, is a member of the p38 MAP kinase subfamily within the larger serine/threonine kinase superfamily. It is evolutionarily conserved across eukaryotes and is present in mammals as well as lower organisms, highlighting its fundamental role in cellular stress and inflammatory signaling. In the human kinome classification, p38α is grouped with the four p38 isoforms (α, β, γ, δ) that share considerable homology in their catalytic domains yet differ in regulatory and tissue-specific expression properties. Its evolutionary origin can be traced back to ancient eukaryotic protein kinases, and phylogenetic analyses—such as those described in the seminal works by Manning and colleagues—show that p38α and its paralogues diverged early to acquire specialized functions in stress response and cytokine signaling (ganguly2023revisitingp38mitogenactivated pages 3-5, juyoux2023architectureofthe pages 1-3).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed – MAPK14 functions as a serine/threonine kinase that catalyzes the transfer of a gamma-phosphate from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues on target proteins. The reaction can be summarized chemically as: ATP + protein–(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + protein–(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (benn2020clinicallyprecedentedprotein pages 16-17).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements – The catalytic activity of MAPK14 is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions, specifically Mg²⁺, which facilitates proper ATP binding and catalysis. In some contexts, Mn²⁺ may also support its enzymatic function, consistent with requirements for most protein kinases (phan2023p38kinasein pages 4-5).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity – MAPK14 exhibits broad substrate specificity, phosphorylating an estimated 200–300 substrates which include transcription factors (such as ATF2, CREB, and p53), downstream kinases (for example, MAPKAPK2/MK2 and MAPKAPK3/MK3), and other proteins involved in cellular processes ranging from gene expression to receptor internalization. Substrate recognition is achieved not only by the catalytic cleft but also via docking interactions with linear motifs—short sequence elements enriched in basic residues—that bind to specific docking grooves on MAPK14. For serine/threonine kinases, recent substrate specificity atlases report consensus motifs that may include preferences for nearby arginine or hydrophobic residues in substrates, a finding that is consistent with the broad specificity documented for kinases in this family (robles2023linearmotifspecificity pages 1-2, singh2023molecularinsightsof pages 12-13, federspiel2023p38mitogenactivatedprotein pages 16-17, federspiel2023p38mitogenactivatedprotein pages 17-18). For tyrosine kinases, similar comprehensive analyses have been reported; however, as MAPK14 is a serine/threonine kinase its specificity is best contextualized with the atlas provided by Johnson et al. (2023) and does not follow the consensus motifs typical of the tyrosine kinome (robles2023linearmotifspecificity pages 9-10).\n\n5. Structure – The three-dimensional structure of MAPK14 comprises a typical bilobed kinase fold with an N-terminal lobe mainly responsible for binding ATP and a larger C-terminal lobe that facilitates substrate interactions and regulatory functions. Key structural features include the activation loop harboring a conserved Thr–Gly–Tyr (TGY) motif; dual phosphorylation of the threonine and tyrosine residues in this loop induces conformational changes essential for catalytic activity and substrate binding (juyoux2023architectureofthe pages 15-17). Additional structural elements include the conserved C-helix, which is critical for maintaining the active conformation, and a hydrophobic spine that aligns upon activation. Detailed cryo-electron microscopy and molecular dynamics analyses of the MKK6–p38α complex have highlighted specific interaction interfaces such as the docking interaction between the αG helix of MKK6 and a hydrophobic pocket in the C-lobe of MAPK14; these interactions not only facilitate p38α activation but also contribute to substrate specificity (juyoux2023architectureofthe pages 1-3, juyoux2023architectureofthe pages 17-24). The core catalytic domain is flanked by regions that, although less structured, are important for subcellular localization and the interaction with regulatory proteins.\n\n6. Regulation – MAPK14 is tightly regulated by phosphorylation events, which are critical for its activation and subsequent signal transduction. Activation is typically achieved by upstream MAP kinase kinases, such as MKK3 and MKK6, which phosphorylate the TGY motif in the activation loop, leading to a conformational change that fosters substrate binding and catalytic efficiency (federspiel2023p38mitogenactivatedprotein pages 16-17, ganguly2023revisitingp38mitogenactivated pages 9-11). In addition, MAPK14 can undergo autophosphorylation, sometimes in a TAB1-dependent manner, which further modulates its activity. It is also subject to regulation by protein phosphatases, including dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) such as DUSP1, which can dephosphorylate and inactivate MAPK14 (patysheva2023dualspecificityphosphatasesin pages 7-9). Other regulatory inputs include interactions with scaffold proteins that bring the kinase into proximity with its substrates and upstream activators, and modifications by casein kinase II that enhance autophosphorylation and capability to phosphorylate substrates like p53 (federspiel2023p38mitogenactivatedprotein pages 17-18, ganguly2023revisitingp38mitogenactivated pages 11-12).\n\n7. Function – MAPK14 serves as a central mediator in the cellular response to a variety of stress signals, including pro-inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, and physical stressors. Its role encompasses the activation of downstream kinases such as MSK1, MSK2, MK2, and MK3, which in turn propagate the signal by modulating transcription factors and other cellular targets. In the nucleus, MAPK14 phosphorylates transcription factors like ATF1, ATF2, ELK1, and p53, thereby controlling gene expression that governs cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and differentiation (federspiel2023p38mitogenactivatedprotein pages 16-17, phan2023p38kinasein pages 7-8). MAPK14 is also involved in the regulation of protein turnover in the cytoplasm, contributing to processes such as receptor endocytosis, autophagy, and the ubiquitin–proteasome system; for example, it phosphorylates the metalloprotease ADAM17, which is essential for ectodomain shedding of membrane proteins like TGF-α (federspiel2023p38mitogenactivatedprotein pages 16-17, phan2023p38kinasein pages 8-8). Further, by phosphorylating components such as CDC25B and CDC25C, MAPK14 contributes to cell cycle checkpoints following DNA damage, and through its effects on factors like TIAR and components of the mRNA translational machinery, it influences post-transcriptional gene regulation (ganguly2023revisitingp38mitogenactivated pages 9-11, phan2023p38kinasein pages 6-7). The kinase is ubiquitously expressed with particularly high levels in tissues involved in inflammatory and immune responses, contributing to its recognized role in mediating cellular responses in diseases such as inflammatory arthritis and certain cancers.\n\n8. Other Comments – Several small molecule inhibitors targeting MAPK14 have been developed and are under investigation for clinical applications in diseases characterized by inflammatory and pro-apoptotic dysregulation. Inhibition of MAPK14 has been explored for therapeutic benefit in conditions ranging from rheumatoid arthritis to certain types of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases; clinical candidates such as ralimetinib have entered trials to evaluate their efficacy and safety profiles (federspiel2023p38mitogenactivatedprotein pages 16-17, ganguly2023revisitingp38mitogenactivated pages 5-6). Furthermore, the modulation of MAPK14 activity by regulatory phosphatases such as DUSP1 underscores the therapeutic potential of targeting the signaling network at multiple nodes (patysheva2023dualspecificityphosphatasesin pages 4-6). Notable disease associations of MAPK14 include its involvement in the modulation of inflammatory cytokine production, regulation of cell survival pathways, effects on endothelial cell functions, and the regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), all of which contribute to its role in cancer progression, immune regulation, and tissue repair (federspiel2023p38mitogenactivatedprotein pages 16-17, phan2023p38kinasein pages 7-8, zavvarian2024translationalrelevanceof pages 19-21). Caution is warranted in therapeutic approaches targeting MAPK14 due to its broad substrate specificity and multiple roles in essential cellular processes, which can lead to off-target effects if not precisely controlled.\n\n9.

    "answer": "Question: # Information\n\n**Protein Name: 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase catalytic subunit alpha-2 / gene: PRKAA2 AMPK; AMPK2**\n**Uniprot Id: P54646**\n**Protein alternative names: Acetyl-CoA carboxylase kinase; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase kinase**\n**Protein Function: Catalytic subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an energy sensor protein kinase that plays a key role in regulating cellular energy metabolism (PubMed:17307971, PubMed:17712357). In response to reduction of intracellular ATP levels, AMPK activates energy-producing pathways and inhibits energy-consuming processes: inhibits protein, carbohydrate and lipid biosynthesis, as well as cell growth and proliferation (PubMed:17307971, PubMed:17712357). AMPK acts via direct phosphorylation of metabolic enzymes, and by longer-term effects via phosphorylation of transcription regulators (PubMed:17307971, PubMed:17712357). Regulates lipid synthesis by phosphorylating and inactivating lipid metabolic enzymes such as ACACA, ACACB, GYS1, HMGCR and LIPE; regulates fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis by phosphorylating acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACACA and ACACB) and hormone-sensitive lipase (LIPE) enzymes, respectively (PubMed:7959015). Promotes lipolysis of lipid droplets by mediating phosphorylation of isoform 1 of CHKA (CHKalpha2) (PubMed:34077757). Regulates insulin-signaling and glycolysis by phosphorylating IRS1, PFKFB2 and PFKFB3 (By similarity). Involved in insulin receptor/INSR internalization (PubMed:25687571). AMPK stimulates glucose uptake in muscle by increasing the translocation of the glucose transporter SLC2A4/GLUT4 to the plasma membrane, possibly by mediating phosphorylation of TBC1D4/AS160 (By similarity). Regulates transcription and chromatin structure by phosphorylating transcription regulators involved in energy metabolism such as CRTC2/TORC2, FOXO3, histone H2B, HDAC5, MEF2C, MLXIPL/ChREBP, EP300, HNF4A, p53/TP53, SREBF1, SREBF2 and PPARGC1A (PubMed:11518699, PubMed:11554766, PubMed:15866171, PubMed:17711846, PubMed:18184930). Acts as a key regulator of glucose homeostasis in liver by phosphorylating CRTC2/TORC2, leading to CRTC2/TORC2 sequestration in the cytoplasm (By similarity). In response to stress, phosphorylates 'Ser-36' of histone H2B (H2BS36ph), leading to promote transcription (By similarity). Acts as a key regulator of cell growth and proliferation by phosphorylating FNIP1, TSC2, RPTOR, WDR24 and ATG1/ULK1: in response to nutrient limitation, negatively regulates the mTORC1 complex by phosphorylating RPTOR component of the mTORC1 complex and by phosphorylating and activating TSC2 (PubMed:14651849, PubMed:20160076, PubMed:21205641). Also phosphorylates and inhibits GATOR2 subunit WDR24 in response to nutrient limitation, leading to suppress glucose-mediated mTORC1 activation (PubMed:36732624). In response to energetic stress, phosphorylates FNIP1, inactivating the non-canonical mTORC1 signaling, thereby promoting nuclear translocation of TFEB and TFE3, and inducing transcription of lysosomal or autophagy genes (PubMed:37079666). In response to nutrient limitation, promotes autophagy by phosphorylating and activating ATG1/ULK1 (PubMed:21205641). In that process, it also activates WDR45/WIPI4 (PubMed:28561066). Phosphorylates CASP6, thereby preventing its autoprocessing and subsequent activation (PubMed:32029622). AMPK also acts as a regulator of circadian rhythm by mediating phosphorylation of CRY1, leading to destabilize it (By similarity). May regulate the Wnt signaling pathway by phosphorylating CTNNB1, leading to stabilize it (By similarity). Also acts as a regulator of cellular polarity by remodeling the actin cytoskeleton; probably by indirectly activating myosin (PubMed:17486097). Also phosphorylates CFTR, EEF2K, KLC1, NOS3 and SLC12A1 (PubMed:12519745, PubMed:20074060). Plays an important role in the differential regulation of pro-autophagy (composed of PIK3C3, BECN1, PIK3R4 and UVRAG or ATG14) and non-autophagy (composed of PIK3C3, BECN1 and PIK3R4) complexes, in response to glucose starvation (By similarity). Can inhibit the non-autophagy complex by phosphorylating PIK3C3 and can activate the pro-autophagy complex by phosphorylating BECN1 (By similarity). Upon glucose starvation, promotes ARF6 activation in a kinase-independent manner leading to cell migration (PubMed:36017701). Upon glucose deprivation mediates the phosphorylation of ACSS2 at 'Ser-659', which exposes the nuclear localization signal of ACSS2, required for its interaction with KPNA1 and nuclear translocation (PubMed:28552616). Upon stress, regulates mitochondrial fragmentation through phosphorylation of MTFR1L (PubMed:36367943)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny – The 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase catalytic subunit alpha-2, encoded by PRKAA2 (also known as AMPKα2 or AMPK2), is a member of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) family and is evolutionarily conserved across eukaryotes, being present in species ranging from yeast to mammals (horikoshi2006apolymorphismin pages 1-2). It belongs to the serine/threonine protein kinase group and, along with the alternate isoform encoded by PRKAA1, forms part of the ancient AMPK catalytic core that arose through gene duplication events early during eukaryotic evolution, as described in comparative kinome analyses (ross2016amp‐activatedproteinkinase pages 1-2, mccallum2015prkaa1andprkaa2 pages 7-12). Phylogenetic studies indicate that AMPKα2 clusters with other energy sensor kinases and can be traced back to the ancestral kinases present in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA), sharing key structural and functional features with other kinases involved in cellular energy regulation such as those seen in the AGC and CAMK families (ross2016amp‐activatedproteinkinase pages 2-4, horikoshi2006apolymorphismin pages 1-2). Moreover, in the broader context of the human kinome, AMPKα2 is a 2R-ohnologue that emerged from the two rounds of whole-genome duplication that significantly expanded the protein kinase repertoire in vertebrates (ross2016amp‐activatedproteinkinase pages 1-2, randrianarisoa2020ampksubunitsharbor pages 4-5).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed – The catalytic reaction mediated by PRKAA2 involves the transfer of a phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to specific serine/threonine residues on substrate proteins. In biochemical terms, the reaction can be represented as follows: ATP + [protein]–(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]–(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (ross2016amp‐activatedproteinkinase pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements – The kinase activity of the PRKAA2 protein is dependent on the presence of Mg²⁺ as a cofactor, which is required to coordinate the binding of ATP within the active site and facilitate the phosphoryl transfer reaction (ross2016amp‐activatedproteinkinase pages 2-4).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity – As a serine/threonine kinase, AMPKα2 phosphorylates substrates that often present consensus motifs characterized by the presence of basic residues in positions proximal to the target serine or threonine. Recent systematic studies on the substrate specificity of human serine/threonine kinases have demonstrated that many such kinases, including AMPK isoforms, exhibit a preferential sequence context, though for AMPK specifically the substrate recognition appears to be less strictly defined than in some other kinases (Johnson2023AnAtlas pages 759-766). In general, substrates of AMPKα2 include metabolic enzymes such as acetyl-CoA carboxylases (ACACA and ACACB), hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), and other regulatory molecules that control lipid metabolism, glucose uptake, and protein synthesis (apoorv2018ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 5-8, mei2022effectofampk pages 6-7). The kinase may recognize target motifs that are enriched for hydrophobic and basic residues surrounding the phosphoacceptor site, thereby linking its substrate specificity to its central role in energy homeostasis (Johnson2023AnAtlas pages 759-766).\n\n5. Structure – PRKAA2 consists of a central catalytic kinase domain that is highly conserved among serine/threonine kinases, featuring the typical bilobal structure with an N-terminal lobe harboring β-sheets and a C-terminal lobe predominated by α-helices (ross2016amp‐activatedproteinkinase pages 2-4). The kinase domain includes critical structural features such as an activation loop, wherein phosphorylation of threonine 172 (Thr172) is essential for full kinase activation, a C-helix that participates in the formation of a hydrophobic spine, and an ATP-binding pocket that accommodates Mg²⁺-coordinated ATP (lee2024catalyticisoformsof pages 1-2, ross2016amp‐activatedproteinkinase pages 4-6). Besides the kinase domain, additional regions may contribute to regulatory functions; an autoinhibitory domain adjacent to the catalytic core modulates basal activity and kinetics in response to conformational changes triggered by upstream signals (lee2024catalyticisoformsof pages 5-7, mccallum2015prkaa1andprkaa2 pages 30-34). Computational models and recent experimentally derived crystal structures or AlphaFold predictions reveal that AMPKα2’s C-terminal domain facilitates interactions with regulatory β and γ subunits, thereby integrating signals from cellular energy levels through binding of AMP, ADP, and ATP to the γ subunit (ross2016amp‐activatedproteinkinase pages 2-4, lee2024ampkisa pages 38-42).\n\n6. Regulation – PRKAA2 activity is tightly regulated both allosterically and through post-translational modifications. A key regulatory event is the phosphorylation of Thr172 in the activation loop, primarily mediated by upstream kinases such as LKB1 and, under certain conditions, CaMKK, which dramatically increases the catalytic activity of the enzyme (ross2016amp‐activatedproteinkinase pages 1-2, mei2022effectofampk pages 6-7). AMPKα2 also harbors a serine residue (Ser491), which in contrast to the equivalent residue in AMPKα1, is a poor substrate for inhibitory phosphorylation by Akt and tends to be regulated by autophosphorylation events; such modifications modulate the enzyme’s sensitivity and sustain its activation under energy-depleted conditions (lee2024ampkisa pages 25-29, ross2016amp‐activatedproteinkinase pages 7-9). The binding of AMP (and ADP to a lesser extent) to the regulatory γ subunit not only promotes Thr172 phosphorylation but also protects it from dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases, thereby ensuring that PRKAA2 remains in an active conformation when cellular ATP levels are low (ross2016amp‐activatedproteinkinase pages 2-4, liu2024znfx1promotesampkmediated pages 10-13). In addition, changes in subunit composition and interactions with other proteins, such as those involved in metabolic signaling and autophagy (for example, interactions with ULK1 or IMPDH in specialized tissues) further modulate the activity of AMPKα2 (lee2024ampkisa pages 29-34, matthey reading from mccallum2015prkaa1andprkaa2 pages 7-12).\n\n7. Function – PRKAA2 is a key regulator of cellular energy homeostasis. Upon sensing an increase in the AMP/ATP ratio—an indicator of energy stress—AMPKα2 becomes activated and phosphorylates a broad array of targets, resulting in a dual response: activation of catabolic pathways that generate ATP and repression of anabolic pathways that consume ATP (apoorv2018ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 5-8, mei2022effectofampk pages 6-7). Its substrates include enzymes involved in fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis, such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACACA and ACACB) and hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), thereby decreasing lipid and cholesterol synthesis (apoorv2018ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 5-8, monteverde2015evidenceofcancer‐promoting pages 4-6). Furthermore, AMPKα2 participates in the regulation of glucose homeostasis in liver and muscle by phosphorylating glycogen synthase and modulators of insulin signaling (ross2016amp‐activatedproteinkinase pages 7-9, matheny2017skeletalmusclepi3k pages 1-2). In the neurosensory retina, tissue-specific studies have shown that PRKAA2 plays distinct, non-redundant roles in rod photoreceptors; loss of PRKAA2 disrupts metabolic homeostasis, leading to structural and functional defects mediated at least in part through dysregulation of IMPDH activity and alterations in purine nucleotide levels (lee2024ampkisa pages 25-29, lee2024ampkisa pages 29-34). In addition to its metabolic roles, AMPKα2 is involved in broader cellular processes such as autophagy regulation through phosphorylation of ULK1, modulation of transcription via phosphorylation of key transcription regulators (e.g., FOXO3, ChREBP, CRTC2), and maintaining cell growth inhibition by down-regulating mTORC1 activity (ross2016amp‐activatedproteinkinase pages 2-4, mei2022effectofampk pages 6-7). Its expression is generally widespread, with significant levels in tissues such as skeletal muscle, liver, brain, and retina, where its activity is essential for adapting to energetic stress (apoorv2018ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 5-8, randrianarisoa2020ampksubunitsharbor pages 21-22).\n\n8. Other Comments – PRKAA2 has garnered interest as a potential therapeutic target because its modulation affects metabolic balance and energy homeostasis in various diseases including type 2 diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance, cardiovascular disorders, and certain cancers; genetic polymorphisms in PRKAA2 have been associated with altered serum lipid profiles and susceptibility to metabolic diseases (randrianarisoa2020ampksubunitsharbor pages 20-21, horikoshi2006apolymorphismin pages 1-2). Additionally, in the context of cancer biology, while alterations in the expression or mutation status of AMPKα1 are more commonly linked to oncogenic processes, emerging evidence suggests that PRKAA2 may function as a tumor suppressor, as decreased expression or activity of AMPKα2 has been linked to enhanced tumor growth and metabolic reprogramming (ross2016amp‐activatedproteinkinase pages 7-9, monteverde2015evidenceofcancer‐promoting pages 4-6). Several small-molecule modulators and inhibitors have been developed to target various AMPK complexes, and while these agents can affect both AMPKα1 and AMPKα2 isoforms, ongoing research continues to delineate the isoform-specific effects that could lead to selective therapeutic strategies (su2022atrialampactivatedprotein pages 12-13, randrianarisoa2020ampksubunitsharbor pages 26-27).\n\n9.

Plays an important role in cellular stress response. Contributes to regulation of renal Na(+) retention, renal K(+) elimination, salt appetite, gastric acid secretion, intestinal Na(+)/H(+) exchange and nutrient transport, insulin-dependent salt sensitivity of blood pressure, salt sensitivity of peripheral glucose uptake, cardiac repolarization and memory consolidation. Up-regulates Na(+) channels: SCNN1A/ENAC, SCN5A and ASIC1/ACCN2, K(+) channels: KCNJ1/ROMK1, KCNA1-5, KCNQ1-5 and KCNE1, epithelial Ca(2+) channels: TRPV5 and TRPV6, chloride channels: BSND, CLCN2 and CFTR, glutamate transporters: SLC1A3/EAAT1, SLC1A2 /EAAT2, SLC1A1/EAAT3, SLC1A6/EAAT4 and SLC1A7/EAAT5, amino acid transporters: SLC1A5/ASCT2, SLC38A1/SN1 and SLC6A19, creatine transporter: SLC6A8, Na(+)/dicarboxylate cotransporter: SLC13A2/NADC1, Na(+)-dependent phosphate cotransporter: SLC34A2/NAPI-2B, glutamate receptor: GRIK2/GLUR6. Up-regulates carriers: SLC9A3/NHE3, SLC12A1/NKCC2, SLC12A3/NCC, SLC5A3/SMIT, SLC2A1/GLUT1, SLC5A1/SGLT1 and SLC15A2/PEPT2. Regulates enzymes: GSK3A/B, PMM2 and Na(+)/K(+) ATPase, and transcription factors: CTNNB1 and nuclear factor NF-kappa-B. Stimulates sodium transport into epithelial cells by enhancing the stability and expression of SCNN1A/ENAC. This is achieved by phosphorylating the NEDD4L ubiquitin E3 ligase, promoting its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, thereby preventing it from binding to SCNN1A/ENAC and targeting it for degradation. Regulates store-operated Ca(+2) entry (SOCE) by stimulating ORAI1 and STIM1. Regulates KCNJ1/ROMK1 directly via its phosphorylation or indirectly via increased interaction with SLC9A3R2/NHERF2. Phosphorylates MDM2 and activates MDM2-dependent ubiquitination of p53/TP53. Phosphorylates MAPT/TAU and mediates microtubule depolymerization and neurite formation in hippocampal neurons. Phosphorylates SLC2A4/GLUT4 and up-regulates its activity. Phosphorylates APBB1/FE65 and promotes its localization to the nucleus. Phosphorylates MAPK1/ERK2 and activates it by enhancing its interaction with MAP2K1/MEK1 and MAP2K2/MEK2. Phosphorylates FBXW7 and plays an inhibitory role in the NOTCH1 signaling. Phosphorylates FOXO1 resulting in its relocalization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Phosphorylates FOXO3, promoting its exit from the nucleus and interference with FOXO3-dependent transcription. Phosphorylates BRAF and MAP3K3/MEKK3 and inhibits their activity. Phosphorylates SLC9A3/NHE3 in response to dexamethasone, resulting in its activation and increased localization at the cell membrane. Phosphorylates CREB1. Necessary for vascular remodeling during angiogenesis. Sustained high levels and activity may contribute to conditions such as hypertension and diabetic nephropathy. Isoform 2 exhibited a greater effect on cell plasma membrane expression of SCNN1A/ENAC and Na(+) transport than isoform 1**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nSerine/threonine‐protein kinase SGK1 belongs to the AGC kinase family, a conserved group of kinases that also includes protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase G (PKG), protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, Akt (also called protein kinase B) and S6 kinases. SGK1 is evolutionarily conserved across eukaryotes and is present in all mammalian species. In vertebrates the SGK family comprises three paralogs – SGK1, SGK2 and SGK3 – which are encoded by distinct genes and exhibit partially overlapping yet divergent tissue expression patterns and substrate specificities. SGK1 is ubiquitously expressed, with high transcript levels detected in tissues such as kidney, heart, liver, pancreas and brain, while SGK2 shows more tissue-restricted expression and SGK3 possesses an additional Phox homology (PX) domain that targets it to endosomal membranes. Phylogenetic analyses based on the protein kinase complement of the human genome indicate that SGK1, along with other AGC kinases, arose from common ancestral eukaryotic genes and forms part of an evolutionarily conserved core set of kinases whose origins predate the divergence of yeast and mammals (jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 1-3, lang2020theenigmaticrole pages 1-2, Manning2022).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nSGK1 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues on its substrate proteins. The chemical reaction can be represented as follows:  \nATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 3-4).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of SGK1 requires the presence of divalent cations. In particular, Mg²⁺ acts as an essential cofactor that facilitates ATP binding and phosphoryl transfer during the enzymatic reaction (lou2016serumandglucocorticoid pages 3-5).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nSGK1 phosphorylates a wide spectrum of substrates involved in ion transport, metabolism, transcription regulation, cell survival, and cytoskeletal dynamics. Experimentally, SGK1 has been shown to modify proteins such as NDRG1, FOXO3a, NEDD4-2, TSC2, ULK1, and β-catenin (jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 1-3). In addition, SGK1 regulates numerous ion channels and transporters by phosphorylating them directly or by modifying their regulatory proteins. For example, phosphorylation of the ubiquitin ligase NEDD4L by SGK1 interferes with its interaction with the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), resulting in enhanced channel stability and function (jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 3-4, lou2016serumandglucocorticoid pages 14-15). Published substrate specificity studies for serine/threonine kinases indicate that kinases in this family frequently preferentially phosphorylate substrates that display a basic residue-rich motif – for instance an RxRxxS/T consensus motif – although SGK1 appears capable of accommodating a broad substrate spectrum due to its versatile active site (jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 13-14, lang2020theenigmaticrole pages 2-3).\n\n5. Structure  \nSGK1 is a 431–amino acid protein that is organized into several distinct domains. The N-terminal region includes a PX-like motif that may contribute to subcellular localization, while the central kinase domain constitutes the catalytic core responsible for its enzymatic activity. This kinase domain contains conserved features shared among AGC kinases, including a catalytic lysine (Lys127) essential for ATP binding, a conserved Asp-Phe-Gly (DFG) motif necessary for magnesium coordination and catalysis, and a hinge region that forms hydrogen bonds with ATP (jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 3-4). A critical leucine residue (Leu176) in the catalytic domain acts as a gatekeeper in the ATP-binding pocket. Moreover, the C-terminal hydrophobic motif (including Ser422) is crucial for full activation, as phosphorylation of this region by mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) promotes conformational changes required for subsequent activation loop phosphorylation by PDK1 at Thr256 (jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 1-3, maestro2020serumandglucocorticoidinduced pages 3-4). The overall three-dimensional structure is thus characterized by a bilobal kinase core with flexible regulatory regions that allow integration of upstream signals and determine substrate interactions (jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 3-4, maestro2020serumandglucocorticoidinduced pages 4-6).\n\n6. Regulation  \nSGK1 activity is tightly regulated both at the transcriptional and post-translational levels. Transcriptionally, SGK1 is rapidly induced by extracellular stimuli such as serum, glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and cytokines (jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 1-3, lang2020theenigmaticrole pages 1-2). Following synthesis, SGK1 undergoes critical phosphorylation events for activation. First, mTOR complex 2 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif at Ser422, which induces a conformational change that allows PDK1 to subsequently phosphorylate the activation loop at Thr256. These phosphorylation events are essential for full kinase activation and enable SGK1 to phosphorylate its downstream substrates (jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 1-3, maestro2020serumandglucocorticoidinduced pages 11-12). In addition to phosphorylation, SGK1 is subject to regulatory modifications such as ubiquitination that control its short half-life (approximately 30 minutes) and cellular abundance (maestro2020serumandglucocorticoidinduced pages 3-4, jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 17-17). Conformational regulation via subcellular localization also plays a role; for instance, serum stimulation can promote nuclear translocation while glucocorticoids and hyperosmotic stress favor cytoplasmic retention (maestro2020serumandglucocorticoidinduced pages 3-4, jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 3-4).\n\n7. Function  \nSGK1 plays diverse roles in cellular physiology via its ability to phosphorylate an extensive array of target proteins. Functionally, SGK1 is a critical regulator of ion channels and transporters. It enhances sodium uptake and retention in epithelial cells by phosphorylating NEDD4L, thereby stabilizing the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and preventing its ubiquitin‐dependent degradation (jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 3-4, lou2016serumandglucocorticoid pages 14-15). Through its actions on ion channels, SGK1 contributes to the regulation of renal sodium reabsorption, renal potassium excretion, salt appetite, and overall electrolyte homeostasis (lou2016serumandglucocorticoid pages 15-17, maestro2020serumandglucocorticoidinduced pages 6-7).  \nBeyond ion transport, SGK1 influences multiple cellular processes such as cell proliferation, survival, migration, and apoptosis. It phosphorylates transcription factors like FOXO1 and FOXO3, modulating their subcellular localization and transcriptional activity, and thereby influencing gene expression programs involved in cell survival and metabolic regulation (jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 3-4, maestro2020serumandglucocorticoidinduced pages 12-13). SGK1 also phosphorylates regulators of cell cycle progression and mediators of cellular stress response, playing a role in autophagy modulation and cellular adaptation to environmental stress (jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 6-8, maestro2020serumandglucocorticoidinduced pages 8-10). In the nervous system, SGK1 phosphorylates MAPT/TAU which is linked to microtubule dynamics and neurite formation in hippocampal neurons, contributing to aspects of memory consolidation and neuronal survival (jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 1-3, lang2020theenigmaticrole pages 1-2). SGK1’s involvement in signal transduction pathways extends to modulation of enzymes such as GSK3α/β, regulation of MDM2-dependent p53 ubiquitination, and stimulation of ERK2 via strengthening its interaction with upstream kinases (jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 14-15, maestro2020serumandglucocorticoidinduced pages 13-14). Collectively, these functions situate SGK1 as a multifunctional regulator that integrates hormonal and stress signals to control ion transport, metabolism, and cell survival (jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 6-8, lang2020theenigmaticrole pages 2-3, lou2016serumandglucocorticoid pages 15-17).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral small-molecule inhibitors targeting SGK1 have been developed and characterized in preclinical studies. For example, inhibitors such as SI113 and azaindole analogs exhibit potent inhibition in the nanomolar range and have been evaluated for their roles in modulating cancer cell proliferation and cardiac hypertrophy (jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 13-14, jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 14-15). Natural compounds like herbacetin have also been identified as SGK1 inhibitors, showing effects on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and other cellular processes (jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 13-14). In addition, experimental agents like EMD638683 have been used to explore the role of SGK1 in hypertension by reducing phosphorylation of downstream targets such as NDRG1 and by lowering blood pressure in animal models (lou2016serumandglucocorticoid pages 5-8). Clearly, aberrant SGK1 activity is implicated in diverse pathologies including hypertension, diabetic nephropathy, certain cancers (such as breast, prostate and colorectal cancer) and neurodegenerative disorders. Genetic variants or dysregulated expression of SGK1 have been associated with increased salt sensitivity, altered blood pressure regulation, and metabolic dysfunction (jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 17-17, lou2016serumandglucocorticoid pages 27-27). There remains ongoing interest in developing more selective and potent SGK1 inhibitors for therapeutic applications, and such inhibitors are being actively studied in both cellular and animal models (sherk2008developmentofa pages 5-6, guerriero2020serumandglucocorticoidinducible pages 15-17).\n\n9.
