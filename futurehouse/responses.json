Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nSerine/threonine‐protein kinase H1 (PSKH1; UniProt ID: P11801) is classified under the non‐specific serine/threonine kinase group, which falls within the EC 2.7.11.1 category of transferases that use ATP to phosphorylate serine or threonine residues. PSKH1 has been identified in human cells and its orthologs are found in a broad array of eukaryotic species ranging from yeast to higher vertebrates, indicating an evolutionarily conserved role in cellular regulation (anti2009nonspecificserinethreonineprotein pages 1-7). Backbone studies on the kinome, as exemplified by the pioneering works of Manning and colleagues, have established that a core set of eukaryotic serine/threonine kinases originated early in evolution; PSKH1 is grouped with these core kinases and thereby shares a common ancestry with other members of the serine/threonine kinase superfamily (anti2009nonspecificserinethreonineprotein pages 13-16). In-depth analysis comparing PSKH1 with its paralog PSKH2 has revealed that while PSKH1 possesses conserved catalytic residues and regulatory motifs typical of an active kinase, PSKH2 exhibits key substitutions (notably in the canonical HRD motif) that render it catalytically inactive in higher chordates (shrestha2020cataloguingthedead pages 14-16). This divergence illustrates an evolutionary transition in which one paralog retains kinase activity while the other may have shifted towards noncatalytic regulatory roles. In addition, bioinformatic studies and hidden Markov model–based classifications have corroborated the placement of PSKH1 within the Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent kinase (CAMK) family, a subgroup of conventional kinases notable for regulation by Ca²⁺ sensor proteins and common structural motifs such as the glycine-rich loop and activation segment (ho2014creationandcharacterization pages 14-15, shrestha2020cataloguingthedead pages 14-16). Collectively, these findings position PSKH1 as a member of the evolutionary conserved kinase core in eukaryotes, with orthologs that trace back to the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) and with sequence and structural features that align it with other key kinases implicated in RNA processing and other signaling cascades (anti2009nonspecificserinethreonineprotein pages 1-7).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nPSKH1 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl side chain of serine or threonine residues in protein substrates. The fundamental chemical reaction is: ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (anti2009nonspecificserinethreonineprotein pages 42-45). This phosphoryl transfer reaction is a prototypical feature of serine/threonine kinases, whereby an electrophilic phosphate moiety is transferred to the nucleophilic hydroxyl group on target proteins. Such a reaction not only requires proper substrate recognition but also appropriate positioning of ATP within the catalytic cleft of the kinase to facilitate efficient phosphate transfer (anti2009nonspecificserinethreonineprotein pages 42-45).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe enzymatic activity of PSKH1 depends on the presence of divalent cations, with Mg²⁺ serving as the primary cofactor required for catalysis. Mg²⁺ ions coordinate with the ATP molecule to stabilize its negative charges and correctly orient the phosphate groups for effective transfer to the protein substrate. The requirement for Mg²⁺ is a common feature among serine/threonine kinases, ensuring that the phosphoryl transfer reaction proceeds under physiological conditions (anti2009nonspecificserinethreonineprotein pages 29-32).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nPSKH1 is implicated in the phosphorylation of proteins present within nuclear splice factor compartments (SFCs), particularly targeting non-snRNP splicing factors that contain serine/arginine-rich (SR) domains. Experimental evidence from studies has demonstrated that overexpression of PSKH1 influences alternative splicing patterns—for instance, by activating the adenovirus E1A distal 9S splice site in a dose-dependent manner—even though direct phosphorylation of canonical SR proteins such as ASF/SF2 has not been clearly demonstrated (brede2002pskh1anovel pages 6-7, brede2002pskh1anovel pages 7-8). Moreover, substrate recognition studies performed using positional scanning peptide arrays reveal that kinases within the CAMK family, to which PSKH1 belongs, tend to prefer substrates with a strong bias for basic residues, particularly arginine, at the -3 position relative to the phosphorylated serine (horne2025pskh1kinaseactivity pages 2-3). While a precise consensus sequence for PSKH1 has not been definitively established, its general substrate specificity is inferred from experimental observations and its classification among non-specific serine/threonine kinases (anti2009nonspecificserinethreonineprotein pages 10-13).\n\n5. Structure  \nPSKH1 exhibits the typical bilobal structure characteristic of serine/threonine kinases. The protein contains a central catalytic domain comprised of approximately 300 amino acids, within which 12 conserved subdomains delineate functional regions for nucleotide binding and catalysis (brede2002pskh1anovel pages 7-8). The N-terminal lobe of PSKH1 is predominantly composed of β-sheets and is primarily involved in ATP binding, utilizing a conserved lysine residue (located in subdomain II) to anchor the phosphates of ATP (berson1999identificationandcharacterization pages 4-5). The larger C-terminal lobe, which is primarily α-helical, harbors the substrate-binding region and includes the catalytic aspartate in subdomain VI that functions as a critical proton acceptor during phosphoryl transfer. In addition to these conserved features, PSKH1 contains a distinctive C-terminal domain rich in serine/arginine dipeptides that is instrumental for targeting the kinase to splice factor compartments (brede2002pskh1anovel pages 7-8). This SR-rich region is reminiscent of the RS domains found in splicing factors and appears to operate in a dual-domain mechanism together with the catalytic kinase domain to facilitate nuclear localization (brede2002pskh1anovel pages 7-8). Structural predictions based on AlphaFold modeling indicate that PSKH1 adopts the classical protein kinase fold with a well-defined catalytic core, and its overall architecture is consistent with other members of the CAMK family (horne2025pskh1kinaseactivity pages 9-9). Furthermore, studies have identified that PSKH1 undergoes dual acylation events—including N-terminal myristoylation and palmitoylation—which serve to direct its membrane association, particularly to the Golgi apparatus (berson1999identificationandcharacterization pages 4-5). These lipid modifications, which are conserved between human and mouse orthologs, suggest that PSKH1 exists in both nuclear and membrane-associated pools, thereby supporting its multifaceted role in intracellular signaling and RNA processing (berson1999identificationandcharacterization pages 4-5).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of PSKH1 is multifactorial and involves both post-translational modifications and allosteric interactions. One regulatory mechanism is based on reversible phosphorylation within the activation loop of the kinase domain, a modification that can alter the conformational state of PSKH1 and thereby modulate its catalytic efficiency (brede2002pskh1anovel pages 7-8). Experimental data indicate that even kinase-negative mutants of PSKH1, which are defective in phosphoryl transfer, are capable of influencing the nuclear distribution of SR proteins, suggesting that PSKH1 can regulate splice factor compartment dynamics in a phosphorylation-independent manner (brede2002pskh1anovel pages 7-8). In addition, PSKH1 activity is subject to allosteric modulation by Ca²⁺ sensor proteins. Recent biochemical analyses have shown that Ca²⁺-bound calmodulin (CaM) binds directly to the kinase domain of PSKH1, leading to an enhancement of its kinase activity, while Ca²⁺-binding proteins of the CREC family, such as Reticulocalbin-3, antagonize its activity (horne2025pskh1kinaseactivity pages 5-6). This dual regulation by Ca²⁺ sensor proteins introduces an additional layer of control whereby intracellular Ca²⁺ concentrations can either potentiate or inhibit PSKH1 activity. Moreover, the adaptor protein UNC119B, known for its role in trafficking myristoylated cargo proteins, has been identified as another regulator that allosterically activates PSKH1; mutation of the N-terminal myristoylation site in PSKH1 disrupts this interaction, thereby highlighting the significance of lipid modifications in its regulatory network (horne2025pskh1kinaseactivity pages 9-9). These regulatory strategies, which encompass both phosphorylation dynamics and protein–protein interactions, enable PSKH1 to exert context-dependent effects on splice factor dynamics and pre-mRNA processing (horne2025pskh1kinaseactivity pages 5-6, brede2002pskh1anovel pages 7-8).\n\n7. Function  \nPSKH1 is primarily implicated in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing through its activity within nuclear splice factor compartments. Experimental studies have demonstrated that forced expression of PSKH1 in HeLa cells modulates alternative splicing patterns, notably by promoting the use of a distal splice site in adenoviral E1A pre-mRNA, in a manner that is partially independent of its catalytic activity (brede2002pskh1anovel pages 6-7, brede2002pskh1anovel pages 7-8). This observation suggests that PSKH1 can alter the local concentration and distribution of SR proteins—which are critical for splice site selection—by affecting their phosphorylation status and nuclear localization. In addition to its role in splice regulation, PSKH1 has been found to associate with key cellular structures such as the Golgi apparatus and centrosomes, implicating it in aspects of intracellular trafficking and possibly in the organization of ciliary and Golgi-related signaling pathways (horne2025pskh1kinaseactivity pages 9-9, spiridonov2005identificationandcharacterization pages 4-5). The interaction with the adaptor protein UNC119B further links PSKH1 to processes involved in cilia formation and membrane trafficking; disruption of UNC119B binding abrogates PSKH1 activation and may lead to defects in ciliary organization and kidney development (horne2025pskh1kinaseactivity pages 9-9, shrestha2020cataloguingthedead pages 14-16). Moreover, the dual acylation of PSKH1, with modifications such as myristoylation and palmitoylation, underpins its ability to partition between endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi membranes, thereby integrating membrane-associated signaling with nuclear splicing regulation (berson1999identificationandcharacterization pages 4-5). Expression profiling indicates that PSKH1 is ubiquitously expressed but shows enrichment in tissues with high demands for precise splicing regulation, which may include brain, kidney, and cells undergoing rapid proliferation and differentiation (brede2002pskh1anovel pages 6-7, shrestha2020cataloguingthedead pages 12-14). As such, PSKH1 is positioned to influence alternative splicing choices that affect gene expression programs critical for development and cellular responses to stress.\n\n8. Other Comments  \nCurrently, no selective small molecule inhibitors targeting PSKH1 have been prominently reported in the literature available from the provided sources. Although PSKH1 shares structural and regulatory similarities with other serine/threonine kinases for which inhibitors have been developed, such as those belonging to the CAMK and AGC families, evidence for direct pharmacological modulation of PSKH1 is still emerging. The dual roles of PSKH1—in both its catalytic phosphorylation activity and its capacity to regulate splice factor distribution independent of kinase activity—complicate the identification of specific inhibitors. Additionally, despite its involvement in alternative splicing, a process that is frequently dysregulated in disease, no clinical mutations or definitive disease associations have been directly attributed to PSKH1 in the current dataset (anti2009nonspecificserinethreonineprotein pages 87-89, anti2009nonspecificserinethreonineprotein pages 34-37). Nonetheless, the modulation of splice factor compartment dynamics by PSKH1 suggests that its misregulation could potentially contribute to splicing-related disorders, and further investigation into its role in human diseases—especially in contexts of kidney ciliopathies and possibly cancer—remains warranted. The evolutionary conservation of its catalytic domain and regulatory features supports the notion that PSKH1’s function is critical for normal cellular homeostasis. Moreover, its relationship with other kinases that possess known inhibitors raises the possibility that future studies may identify compounds capable of modulating PSKH1 activity selectively (horne2025pskh1kinaseactivity pages 9-9, shrestha2020cataloguingthedead pages 14-16).\n\n9.

Involved in Toll-like receptor (TLR) and IL-1R signaling pathways. Is rapidly recruited by MYD88 to the receptor-signaling complex upon TLR activation. Association with MYD88 leads to IRAK1 phosphorylation by IRAK4 and subsequent autophosphorylation and kinase activation. Phosphorylates E3 ubiquitin ligases Pellino proteins (PELI1, PELI2 and PELI3) to promote pellino-mediated polyubiquitination of IRAK1. Then, the ubiquitin-binding domain of IKBKG/NEMO binds to polyubiquitinated IRAK1 bringing together the IRAK1-MAP3K7/TAK1-TRAF6 complex and the NEMO-IKKA-IKKB complex. In turn, MAP3K7/TAK1 activates IKKs (CHUK/IKKA and IKBKB/IKKB) leading to NF-kappa-B nuclear translocation and activation. Alternatively, phosphorylates TIRAP to promote its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Phosphorylates the interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) to induce its activation and translocation to the nucleus, resulting in transcriptional activation of type I IFN genes, which drive the cell in an antiviral state.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nIRAK1 is a serine/threonine kinase that is a central member of the IRAK family, a distinct subgroup within the human kinome responsible for transducing signals from Toll‑like receptors (TLRs) and interleukin‑1 receptors (IL‑1Rs) (bahia2015interleukin1receptorassociated pages 17-17). Evolutionary analyses indicate that IRAK1 is highly conserved across mammalian species and that orthologs of IRAK1 are present in a variety of vertebrate lineages, including fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. This widespread conservation reflects the ancient origin of IRAK1 as an indispensable element of innate immunity (flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 24-28). Within the IRAK family, four members are recognized in humans: IRAK1, IRAK2, IRAK3 (also known as IRAK‑M), and IRAK4. Although all of these proteins share a conserved domain organization that includes an N‑terminal death domain and a central kinase domain, IRAK1 distinguishes itself through its high catalytic activity and unique interaction surfaces with the signaling adaptor MyD88 (dardick2006plantandanimal pages 3-6). Comparative phylogenetic studies, inspired by the pioneering work of Manning and colleagues, have revealed that the IRAK family proteins emerged from gene duplication events early in the evolution of vertebrates. Subsequent functional specialization among these paralogs has resulted in IRAK1 maintaining robust kinase activity while other members, such as IRAK3, have evolved primarily negative regulatory roles (ringwood2008theinvolvementof pages 1-2). In this way, IRAK1 occupies a central and evolutionarily ancient position within an immune signaling module that is indispensable for host defense.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nIRAK1 catalyzes the ATP‐dependent phosphorylation of protein substrates specifically on serine and threonine residues. In this capacity, the kinase transfers the terminal (γ) phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group on the side chains of serine or threonine residues present in its target proteins. The overall chemical reaction can be summarized as:  \n  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺  \nThis phosphorylation event is fundamental to IRAK1’s role in propagating downstream signaling events in the innate immune response, ultimately leading to modifications in the activity or stability of those substrates (flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 24-28).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nSimilar to canonical serine/threonine kinases, IRAK1 requires the presence of divalent metal ions to facilitate its catalytic activity. In particular, magnesium ions (Mg²⁺) are essential for ATP binding within the active site. The Mg²⁺ ion coordinates with the phosphates of ATP to correctly orient the γ-phosphate for efficient transfer onto the serine/threonine residue of the substrate. This metal ion requirement is a characteristic feature of the kinase catalytic mechanism and is critical for ensuring the high-fidelity phosphotransfer reaction that underpins IRAK1’s signaling role (bahia2015interleukin1receptorassociated pages 17-17).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nIRAK1 exhibits a substrate specificity that underlies its ability to modulate key components in the innate immune signaling cascade. One prominent group of substrates for IRAK1 consists of the E3 ubiquitin ligases collectively known as the Pellino protein family, which includes PELI1, PELI2, and PELI3. Phosphorylation of these Pellino proteins by IRAK1 plays a critical role in triggering their E3 ligase activity, which in turn leads to K63-linked polyubiquitination of IRAK1. This polyubiquitination serves as a signal amplification mechanism, facilitating the formation of a signaling complex that integrates additional downstream components (bossart2025quantitativeproteomicsof pages 95-97).  \nAdditionally, IRAK1 phosphorylates the Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor protein (TIRAP). Phosphorylation of TIRAP primes it for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation, thereby contributing to the negative feedback regulation of the receptor signal. Another significant substrate is interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7); phosphorylation of IRF7 by IRAK1 is essential for its activation and subsequent translocation to the nucleus, where it induces the expression of type I interferon genes (flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 32-35).  \nFurthermore, when IRAK1 undergoes sumoylation, it translocates into the nucleus, enabling it to phosphorylate the transcription factor STAT3. Phosphorylation of STAT3 influences the transcription of genes involved in cell survival and inflammatory responses (balasuriya2020phosphorylationdependentsubstrateselectivity pages 3-5).  \nAlthough a strictly defined consensus phosphorylation motif for IRAK1 has not been fully characterized, its substrate repertoire clearly shows a preference for key regulatory proteins that modulate both inflammatory and antiviral responses.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5. Structure  \nIRAK1 is a multidomain protein whose structural organization facilitates its role as both a kinase and an adaptor in immune signaling. The most N‑terminal segment of IRAK1 contains the death domain (DD), which is critical for mediating homotypic protein–protein interactions with the adaptor MyD88. This DD is indispensable for the rapid recruitment of IRAK1 to activated TLR or IL‑1 receptor complexes in the early phases of signal transduction (flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 5-9).  \nCentrally, IRAK1 harbors a highly conserved serine/threonine kinase domain that exhibits the classic bilobal architecture common among eukaryotic protein kinases. The N-terminal lobe of this domain is predominantly composed of β-sheets and is relatively small compared to the larger C-terminal lobe, which is rich in α-helical structures (gosu2014structuraldynamicanalysis pages 11-12). These lobes are connected by a flexible hinge region, forming the ATP-binding pocket that coordinates the necessary Mg²⁺-ATP complex.  \nWithin the kinase domain, several critical structural motifs facilitate catalytic activity. The glycine-rich loop, located in the N-terminal lobe, is essential for proper positioning of ATP by allowing the required flexibility and stabilization of the phosphate groups. Adjacent to this, the catalytic loop contains key residues that contribute to the phosphate transfer mechanism. The activation loop, a flexible segment that undergoes phosphorylation, further regulates the conformational state of the kinase and its transition to an active state upon receiving phosphorylation signals from upstream kinases – notably IRAK4 – as well as via autophosphorylation events (flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 9-13).  \nAnother important element within the kinase domain is the conserved C-helix, which plays a role in aligning the active site residues necessary for phosphotransfer. Collectively, these sub-structures, including the catalytic and activation loops and the C-helix, form what is known as the catalytic spine and hydrophobic core, ensuring both the stability and functional competence of the kinase domain.  \nAlthough full-length high-resolution crystal structures of IRAK1 are not yet available, homology models derived from related kinases, particularly IRAK4, have provided significant insights regarding the spatial arrangement of its domains. These models suggest that IRAK1, in addition to its kinase core, houses regulatory regions that are potential targets for post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination and sumoylation. Sequence analysis also implies the presence of nuclear localization signals embedded within its non-catalytic regions, which become accessible upon specific modifications like sumoylation, thus permitting nuclear translocation under defined cellular conditions (gosu2014structuraldynamicanalysis pages 12-12, reinhardt2023acriticalevaluation pages 26-27).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulatory mechanisms governing IRAK1 activity are multi-tiered and rely on an intricate network of post-translational modifications and protein–protein interactions. In response to the engagement of TLRs or IL‑1Rs, the adaptor protein MyD88 recruits IRAK1 to the receptor complex via interactions through the death domain (flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 1-5). Once localized to the receptor complex, IRAK1 is phosphorylated by the upstream kinase IRAK4 on key serine and threonine residues within its activation loop, an event that is crucial for priming IRAK1 and enabling its subsequent autophosphorylation (bahia2015interleukin1receptorassociated pages 17-17, rhyasen2015iraksignallingin pages 1-2).  \nPost-activation, IRAK1 establishes further layers of regulation through its ability to phosphorylate downstream targets. One critical event is the phosphorylation of the Pellino family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. This phosphorylation facilitates K63-linked polyubiquitination of IRAK1, creating a platform for the binding of ubiquitin-binding proteins such as NEMO (IKBKG) and promoting the assembly of multiprotein signaling complexes that ultimately lead to NF‑κB activation (bossart2025quantitativeproteomicsof pages 95-97).  \nConcomitantly, IRAK1 phosphorylates the adaptor TIRAP, a modification that primes TIRAP for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation, thereby providing a negative feedback loop that helps to attenuate prolonged receptor signaling (flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 32-35, ringwood2008theinvolvementof pages 1-2).  \nA further level of control is exerted via sumoylation of IRAK1. Upon sumoylation, IRAK1 is capable of translocating from the cytosol to the nucleus where it phosphorylates the transcription factor STAT3, thus linking acute immunoregulatory signaling events with longer-term modifications in gene expression (scarneo2020ahighlyselective pages 1-2).  \nTogether, these modifications – including IRAK4-mediated phosphorylation, IRAK1 autophosphorylation, ubiquitination driven by Pellino ligases, and sumoylation – enable a tightly controlled, spatially and temporally regulated activation of IRAK1 within the innate immune response (reinhardt2023acriticalevaluation pages 26-27).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n7. Function  \nIRAK1 is a pivotal mediator in the innate immune system, serving as a crucial link between receptor activation and the downstream signaling cascades that regulate inflammation and antiviral responses. Upon recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by Toll‑like receptors or the binding of interleukin‑1 to its receptor, MyD88 recruits IRAK1 to the receptor complex where it undergoes phosphorylation by IRAK4. This event initiates a cascade of phosphorylation events that amplify the immune signal (bahia2015interleukin1receptorassociated pages 17-17).  \nOne primary role of activated IRAK1 is the phosphorylation of Pellino proteins, a family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. This phosphorylation triggers the polyubiquitination of IRAK1 itself, which in turn promotes the recruitment and assembly of a large signaling complex that includes MAP3K7/TAK1, TRAF6, and the regulatory NEMO-IKK complex. The formation of this signaling complex is essential for the activation of the IKK kinases (IKKA/CHUK and IKBKB), leading to the nuclear translocation of NF‑κB. Once in the nucleus, NF‑κB activates a wide array of inflammatory cytokine genes, thereby driving the inflammatory response (bossart2025quantitativeproteomicsof pages 95-97).  \nIn parallel, IRAK1 phosphorylates TIRAP, which promotes the subsequent ubiquitination and degradation of this adaptor protein, a process that modulates the magnitude and duration of the immune signaling by providing an inherent negative feedback mechanism (flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 32-35).  \nIn addition to controlling proinflammatory pathways, IRAK1 is also integral to antiviral defense. It achieves this by phosphorylating interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7). Phosphorylated IRF7 translocates to the nucleus where it stimulates the transcription of type I interferon genes, leading to the establishment of an antiviral state within the cell (flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 32-35).  \nFurthermore, IRAK1’s function is expanded when it is modified by sumoylation; once sumoylated, IRAK1 translocates to the nucleus, where it is capable of phosphorylating STAT3. The phosphorylation of STAT3 is associated with the regulation of genes involved in cell survival, proliferation, and additional aspects of immune modulation (scarneo2020ahighlyselective pages 1-2).  \nExpression of IRAK1 is predominantly observed in cells of the innate immune system – such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes – but it is also expressed in various non-immune tissues, indicating a broader physiological relevance. In these diverse cellular contexts, IRAK1 functions both as an active kinase initiating signal transduction and as a scaffold that brings together different signaling molecules within the Myddosome complex (bennett2022irak1andirak4 pages 1-2).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n8. Other Comments  \nIRAK1 has been the subject of extensive research owing to its central role in initiating and modulating the immune response, and its dysregulation has been implicated in a range of pathological conditions including autoimmune diseases, chronic inflammatory disorders, and hematologic malignancies. For instance, aberrant activation or overexpression of IRAK1 has been linked with enhanced NF‑κB signaling and is observed in conditions where chronic inflammation is a driving factor (rhyasen2014irakfamilykinases pages 115-119).  \nTherapeutically, IRAK1 is being actively pursued as a target for drug development. Several experimental inhibitors that target the IRAK1/IRAK4 kinase axis have shown antiproliferative effects in preclinical models, particularly in the context of MYD88-mutated B-cell lymphomas, wherein constitutive IRAK signaling supports tumor survival. The highly conserved nature of the ATP-binding pocket between IRAK1 and IRAK4 presents challenges for the development of selective inhibitors; nonetheless, selective inhibition strategies have been reported that discriminate between these kinases enough to delineate their individual signaling roles (scarneo2020ahighlyselective pages 1-2, hatcher2020discoveryofa pages 5-6).  \nMoreover, research has emphasized the dual role of IRAK1. Beyond its catalytic function, IRAK1 can serve as a scaffolding protein within the Myddosome, meaning that strategies solely focused on kinase inhibition might not fully abrogate IRAK1-dependent signaling. Consequently, further understanding of its non-catalytic roles is of considerable interest, particularly in the development of comprehensive therapeutic approaches.  \nThe modulation of IRAK1 activity by post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination and sumoylation not only underscores its multifaceted roles within the cell but also suggests that interventions aimed at modifying these regulatory processes may offer alternative therapeutic benefits. Genetic studies have identified polymorphisms and somatic alterations in IRAK1 associated with altered immune responses, suggesting that in addition to chemical inhibitors, gene-based therapeutic methods might also be developed in the future to target aberrant IRAK1 signaling (rhyasen2015iraksignallingin pages 1-2).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nIRAK2 is a member of the interleukin‐1 receptor‐associated kinase (IRAK) family, which comprises four proteins (IRAK1, IRAK2, IRAK3 [also known as IRAK‐M], and IRAK4) that are conserved throughout metazoans. IRAK2 has been identified in mammals with a single isoform in humans, although multiple splice variants exist in mice. The protein is evolutionarily related to other serine/threonine kinases within the Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interleukin‐1 receptor (IL‑1R) signaling pathways. Its orthologs are traceable across vertebrates, and phylogenetic analyses suggest that members of the IRAK family share a common ancestry with the Drosophila Pelle kinase, indicating a deep evolutionary conservation of innate immune signaling components (su2020irakfamilyin pages 1-5, janssens2003functionaldiversityand pages 2-3).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nThe reaction catalyzed by IRAK2, as expected for a serine/threonine kinase, involves the transfer of the γ‑phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to specific serine or threonine residues on a substrate protein. In chemical terms, the reaction can be represented as:  \nATP + [protein]‑(L‑serine or L‑threonine) → ADP + [protein]‑(L‑serine/threonine)‑phosphate + H⁺.  \nAlthough detailed substrate mapping for IRAK2 is not as extensively defined as for some other kinases, this generic phosphorylation reaction is congruent with its role in signal propagation following IL‑1 receptor engagement (cohen2009targetingproteinkinases pages 8-8).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nLike most protein kinases, the catalytic activity of IRAK2 depends on the presence of divalent metal ions, with magnesium (Mg²⁺) being essential. Mg²⁺ ions coordinate ATP in the kinase active site to facilitate the transfer of phosphate groups to serine/threonine residues on target proteins. This cofactor requirement is in line with its classification as a serine/threonine kinase and is supported by the conservation of crucial ATP-binding residues in its catalytic domain (meylan2008irak2takesits pages 2-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nThe substrate specificity of IRAK2 remains less completely characterized than that of several other kinases, yet experimental data suggest that, by virtue of its conserved kinase domain, IRAK2 preferentially phosphorylates serine/threonine residues within substrates involved in innate immune signaling. In particular, key functional studies indicate its role in phosphorylating or facilitating the activation of downstream components such as TRAF6 via a ubiquitination cascade. While a clear consensus phosphorylation motif is not definitively established for IRAK2 from the current literature, domains and critical lysine residues (e.g., Lys237) are implicated in its catalytic mechanism, suggesting that substrate motifs may involve basic residues in conjunction with flanking serine/threonine sites analogous to other IRAK family kinases (wang2013functionalandepidemiological pages 44-49, wang2013functionalandepidemiological pages 49-53).\n\n5. Structure  \nIRAK2 exhibits a modular structure that is common to the IRAK family. Its domain organization is as follows:  \n\n• An N‑terminal death domain (DD) that mediates homotypic protein–protein interactions; this domain is critical for binding to the adaptor protein MyD88 and assembling into the myddosome complex. (flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 1-5, su2020irakfamilyin pages 1-5)  \n\n• A central ProST (proline-, serine-, threonine‑rich) domain which likely serves as a flexible linker region subject to extensive post‑translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination. This region contributes to the scaffolding function during signal transduction (flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 5-9).  \n\n• A kinase domain that harbors the conserved motifs typical of serine/threonine kinases, including the invariant lysine residue (e.g., Lys237) essential for ATP binding. Although some studies have originally suggested that IRAK2 might be catalytically inactive due to substitutions at critical positions (for example, an asparagine replacing the aspartate in the catalytic loop), subsequent work indicates that IRAK2 is enzymatically active; structural studies have underscored the presence of an ATP‑binding pocket and a tyrosine gatekeeper residue that is characteristic of IRAK family members (cohen2009targetingproteinkinases pages 8-8, flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 5-9, wang2013functionalandepidemiological pages 44-49).  \n\n• A C‑terminal region that contains two TRAF6 binding motifs, which are necessary for propagating downstream signaling events through polyubiquitination processes. This region facilitates the recruitment and activation of TRAF6 and is instrumental in triggering NF‑κB activation (barbera2012activationmechanismsof pages 36-39, flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 5-9).\n\nThis overall structural organization supports IRAK2’s dual role as a kinase and as a scaffolding protein within protein complexes, and the presence of conserved structural features such as the catalytic loop, activation segment, and key residues in the kinase domain indicate its capacity for both catalytic phosphorylation and regulatory interactions (wang2013functionalandepidemiological pages 95-99, meylan2008irak2takesits pages 2-2).\n\n6. Regulation  \nIRAK2 is subject to multiple layers of post‑translational regulation which modulate both its stability and activity. Key regulatory mechanisms include:  \n\n• Phosphorylation: IRAK2 undergoes autophosphorylation and is likely phosphorylated by interacting kinases such as IRAK4 within the myddosome complex. This phosphorylation is essential for its activation and for promoting a sustained NF‑κB signal following receptor stimulation. Specific phosphorylation events are implicated in modulating its interaction with downstream effectors and in controlling its catalytic activity (cohen2009targetingproteinkinases pages 8-8, flannery2011humaninterleukin1receptorassociated pages 1-2, wang2013functionalandepidemiological pages 95-99).\n\n• Ubiquitination: IRAK2 interacts with TRAF6, and it plays a role in supporting TRAF6 polyubiquitination. This post‑translational modification is an essential step in activating downstream signaling pathways such as NF‑κB and MAP kinases. Although specific ubiquitination sites on IRAK2 are not fully mapped, the presence of TRAF6 binding motifs in its C‑terminal region underscores its function in facilitating ubiquitin‐chain formation as part of its regulatory role (zhang2014interleukin1receptorassociatedkinase2 pages 13-13, bahia2015interleukin1receptorassociated pages 3-4).\n\n• Complex assembly: IRAK2 is recruited to the IL‑1R following ligand engagement and forms a multiprotein signaling complex known as the myddosome. This complex includes other IRAK family members (such as IRAK1 and IRAK4) and the adaptor MyD88. The assembly and subsequent disassembly of this complex are tightly regulated, ensuring that downstream signals are both initiated and eventually terminated appropriately. (flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 43-47, pereira2023regulationofinnate pages 1-2).\n\n• Interactions with additional regulatory proteins: IRAK2 activity may be modulated by interacting proteins that either stabilize the protein complex or target proteins for degradation. In contrast to IRAK1, which contains PEST sequences that promote rapid degradation, IRAK2 lacks these sequences, thereby contributing to the sustained signaling observed during prolonged receptor stimulation (wang2013functionalandepidemiological pages 44-49, gan2006regulationsandroles pages 7-8).\n\nThese regulatory layers ensure that IRAK2 functions both as a signal amplifier and as a modulatory scaffold within TLR and IL‑1 receptor signaling pathways (flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 5-9, hu2002regulationofil1 pages 1-2).\n\n7. Function  \nIRAK2 is functionally essential in mediating the cellular response initiated by interleukin‑1 type I receptor engagement. Its primary functions are summarized as follows:  \n\n• Signal propagation: Upon binding of IL‑1 to its receptor, the receptor complex recruits MyD88 which in turn engages IRAK family members. IRAK2 is then recruited to form the myddosome alongside IRAK4 and IRAK1. This assembly leads to the activation of downstream signaling cascades, particularly the NF‑κB and MAP kinase pathways. These cascades result in the transcriptional up‑regulation of pro‑inflammatory genes (flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 43-47, su2020irakfamilyin pages 1-5).\n\n• mRNA stabilization: Beyond initiating transcription, IRAK2 plays a role in the post‑transcriptional regulation of cytokine mRNA by contributing to mechanisms that stabilize these mRNAs once they have been synthesized. This dual role in transcriptional and post‑transcriptional control enhances the amplitude and duration of the inflammatory response (Information section, cohen2009targetingproteinkinases pages 8-8).\n\n• Sustained inflammatory signaling: IRAK2 is particularly important for sustaining NF‑κB activation during prolonged signaling. While IRAK1 may drive early-phase responses, IRAK2 appears critical for maintaining signaling during later phases of TLR stimulation, thereby ensuring a prolonged inflammatory response. This temporal regulation contributes to its role in chronic inflammatory conditions and autoimmune pathologies (flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 43-47, wang2013functionalandepidemiological pages 95-99).\n\n• Interaction with downstream effectors: By binding to TRAF6 via its C‑terminal TRAF6 binding motifs, IRAK2 facilitates the formation of polyubiquitin chains that are essential for the activation of downstream effectors such as the TAK1 kinase complex. This molecular cascade culminates in the nuclear translocation of NF‑κB and activation of target gene transcription (barbera2012activationmechanismsof pages 36-39, flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 5-9).\n\nCollectively, these functions underscore the pivotal role of IRAK2 in orchestrating the innate immune response by coupling receptor engagement to both transcriptional and post‑transcriptional regulatory mechanisms (flannery2011humaninterleukin1receptorassociated pages 1-2, pereira2023regulationofinnate pages 8-9).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nIRAK2 is under active investigation due to its significant role in inflammation and innate immunity. Although specific small molecule inhibitors directly targeting IRAK2 are not well established, the kinase represents a promising target for the development of anti‑inflammatory and immunomodulatory therapeutic agents. Genetic studies and non‑synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IRAK2 have been correlated with altered NF‑κB activity and variations in cytokine responses, which may affect disease outcomes in conditions such as sepsis, autoimmune diseases, and cancer (zhang2014interleukin1receptorassociatedkinase2 pages 13-13, wang2014acodingirak2 pages 2-3). In contrast to IRAK1, which has been the focus of several inhibitor studies, IRAK2’s unique contribution to sustained inflammatory signaling makes it a subject of considerable interest, particularly because its resistance to rapid degradation (owing to the lack of PEST sequences) allows for prolonged signal transduction (gan2006regulationsandroles pages 7-8, flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 5-9). Additionally, functional studies employing genetic knockout and RNA interference strategies have highlighted that loss of IRAK2 function may alter pro‑inflammatory cytokine production, further supporting its candidacy as a target in inflammatory disease therapies (wang2013functionalandepidemiological pages 95-99, ringwood2008theinvolvementof pages 1-2). The interplay between IRAK2 and its interacting partners, including MyD88, IRAK4, and TRAF6, continues to be an essential area of research in order to elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms governing its activity (flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 43-47, pereira2023regulationofinnate pages 1-2).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nIRAK3 is a member of the interleukin‐1 receptor‐associated kinase (IRAK) family, which comprises both catalytically active kinases (such as IRAK1 and IRAK4) and inactive or weakly active pseudokinases (including IRAK2 and IRAK3) (janssens2003functionaldiversityand pages 2-3). Phylogenetic analyses indicate that the IRAK family evolved from a common ancestral kinase that is traceable from early metazoans, and gene duplication events in the vertebrate lineage contributed to the emergence of specialized members such as IRAK3 (gosu2012molecularevolutionand pages 1-2, gosu2012molecularevolutionand pages 9-11). Although IRAK3 orthologs have been identified primarily in mammals, with certain teleost fish also retaining related sequences, the overall arrangement of the family suggests that IRAK3 was a later addition when compared with the more broadly conserved IRAK4-like kinases (gosu2012molecularevolutionand pages 11-12, dardick2006plantandanimal pages 9-10). Within the kinome, IRAK3 is classified as a pseudokinase or an ACF (active site cysteine–containing) kinase member that displays characteristic modifications in the catalytic site, notably the substitution of a critical aspartate residue with a serine residue, which distinguishes it from its catalytically active counterparts (janssens2003functionaldiversityand pages 2-3, lange2021dimericstructureof pages 3-4). This evolutionary placement is further supported by the presence of an N‐terminal death domain and a central pseudokinase domain, which are conserved features among members of the Pelle/IRAK subfamily involved in innate immune receptor signaling (dardick2006plantandanimal pages 3-6, gosu2012molecularevolutionand pages 4-5). The phylogenetic context of IRAK3 underscores its role as a regulatory modulator that diverged from active kinase ancestors during the evolution of the immune system.\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nIn contrast to conventional serine/threonine kinases that catalyze the ATP‐dependent transfer of a phosphate group to protein substrates—typically following the reaction: ATP + [protein]–(L‑serine/threonine) → ADP + [protein]–phospho(L‑serine/threonine) + H⁺—IRAK3 has not been demonstrably associated with such a canonical phosphorylation reaction (flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 20-24, janssens2003functionaldiversityand pages 2-3). Rather than acting as an active phosphotransferase, IRAK3 is widely described as a “putative inactive protein kinase” with a primary role in regulating signaling by tethering or stabilizing components within the receptor complex (Information section). Notwithstanding its lack of classical kinase activity, experimental studies using recombinant full-length IRAK3 have provided evidence of a noncanonical enzymatic activity; specifically, IRAK3 has been shown to possess guanylate cyclase activity, whereby it catalyzes the conversion of GTP into cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) plus pyrophosphate (PPi) (freihat2019irak3modulatesdownstream pages 2-3, freihat2019irak3modulatesdownstream pages 3-5, turek2023mutationsinthe pages 7-10). No direct evidence supports an ATP-dependent phosphotransfer reaction in IRAK3, and therefore the guanylate cyclase reaction represents an alternative catalytic mechanism that is distinct from the phosphorylation reaction mediated by conventional active kinases. This distinction is underscored by the structural changes observed in its active site motifs, which are consistent with an inability to support ATP-dependent phosphorylation (janssens2003functionaldiversityand pages 2-3, freihat2019irak3modulatesdownstream pages 2-3).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nConventional protein kinases typically require the presence of divalent cations—most commonly Mg²⁺—to facilitate ATP binding and the subsequent phosphoryl transfer reaction. In the case of IRAK3, the canonical kinase function is absent and ATP binding is reported to be extremely weak, with studies demonstrating that the addition of Mg²⁺ does not produce significant stabilization or catalytic activation (lange2021dimericstructureof pages 6-7). For its alternative guanylate cyclase activity, however, experimental studies have shown that the enzymatic function of IRAK3 is cofactor-dependent. In these assays, divalent metal ions are required to enable the catalysis of GTP conversion into cGMP, with a preferential requirement for Mn²⁺ over Mg²⁺ observed in vitro (freihat2019irak3modulatesdownstream pages 2-3, freihat2019irak3modulatesdownstream pages 3-5, turek2023mutationsinthe pages 7-10). Thus, while IRAK3 does not exhibit a typical ATP-dependent kinase reaction, its guanylate cyclase function is activated in the presence of Mn²⁺, which appears to serve as the optimal cofactor for this alternative catalytic activity.\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nTraditional serine/threonine kinases are characterized by their recognition of specific consensus substrate motifs such as RxRxxp[ST] which facilitate selective phosphorylation of target proteins. However, due to the inability of IRAK3 to catalyze an ATP-dependent phosphorylation reaction under standard conditions, no defined consensus substrate motif has been established for IRAK3 in terms of protein phosphorylation (janssens2003functionaldiversityand pages 2-3, smith2019alternativesplicingand pages 47-53). In its role as a pseudokinase, IRAK3 instead functions through protein–protein interactions within the receptor signaling complex to regulate downstream signaling events. Regarding its reported guanylate cyclase activity, IRAK3 catalyzes the conversion of GTP into cGMP; nevertheless, the specificity for GTP substrates in this context does not follow the typical substrate motif classification observed for phosphoryl transfer reactions. The guanylate cyclase center present within the pseudokinase domain shows conservation of key residues necessary for GTP binding and subsequent catalysis, but no additional consensus sequence beyond the defined catalytic center has been described (freihat2019irak3modulatesdownstream pages 3-5). Therefore, IRAK3’s substrate specificity in the phosphorylation context is not applicable, and its enzymatic activity is measured instead by the ability to generate cGMP rather than by direct phosphorylation of serine or threonine residues.\n\n5. Structure  \nIRAK3 exhibits a multi-domain architecture that reflects its membership within the IRAK family and distinguishes its regulatory role from catalytically active kinases. At the N-terminus, IRAK3 contains a death domain (DD) that is critical for mediating homotypic interactions with other death domains found in MyD88 and other signaling proteins within the Myddosome complex (janssens2003functionaldiversityand pages 2-3, dardick2006plantandanimal pages 3-6). Adjacent to the death domain is a proline/serine/threonine-rich (ProST) region, which is thought to be intrinsically disordered and may function as a flexible linker that permits dynamic interactions between the DD and the kinase domain. The central portion of IRAK3 comprises a pseudokinase domain that retains the overall fold characteristic of serine/threonine kinases, including a bilobal structure with an N-lobe rich in β-sheet structures and a predominantly α-helical C-lobe (bailey2014biochemicalanalysisof pages 33-37, lange2021dimericstructureof pages 1-3). Despite the presence of a conserved ATP-binding pocket and glycine-rich G-loop, structural analyses have revealed key deviations from the canonical motifs that are essential for catalytic activity. For example, the active site usually containing a catalytic aspartate residue is instead found substituted by a serine residue in IRAK3, and the canonical DFG motif is frequently altered to DFA (janssens2003functionaldiversityand pages 2-3, lange2021dimericstructureof pages 3-4). Recent crystallographic studies indicate that the pseudokinase domain of IRAK3 adopts a closed, pseudoactive conformation stabilized by distinct hydrophobic interactions. Among these, the presence of a conserved hydrophobic anchor residue in the G-loop (such as F177) is notable for maintaining a structured conformation even in the absence of ATP (lange2021dimericstructureof pages 5-6). In addition, structural investigations have identified within the pseudokinase domain a cryptic guanylate cyclase center, which is embedded adjacent to the conventional catalytic motifs. This guanylate cyclase center is responsible for the low-level in vitro production of cGMP, an alternative enzymatic function that is not typical among kinases (freihat2019irak3modulatesdownstream pages 2-3, freihat2019irak3modulatesdownstream pages 3-5). Furthermore, IRAK3 displays an unusual head-to-head dimerization interface in its crystal structure, a property not generally observed in catalytically active kinases, and this dimerization may have functional implications for its allosteric regulation within the immune receptor complex (lange2021dimericstructureof pages 1-3, lange2021dimericstructureof pages 3-4). Overall, the structural organization of IRAK3—with its modular domains (DD, ProST region, and pseudokinase domain) and its unique structural features (altered active site motifs, guanylate cyclase center, and dimerization interface)—distinguishes it from its catalytically active counterparts while preserving a scaffold that facilitates critical regulatory functions in innate immunity (dardick2006plantandanimal pages 6-7, gosu2012molecularevolutionand pages 4-5).\n\n6. Regulation  \nRegulatory mechanisms for IRAK3 are primarily dependent on its role as a negative regulator of Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interleukin-1 receptor (IL1R) signaling rather than on phosphorylation-dependent activation. IRAK3 is predominantly expressed in monocytes and macrophages, where it associates with components of the Myddosome complex to prevent the dissociation of IRAK1 and IRAK4, thereby inhibiting the propagation of downstream inflammatory signals (flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 20-24, dardick2006plantandanimal pages 3-6). Its inhibitory function is mediated principally by protein–protein interactions within the receptor complex that stabilize the assembly and limit subsequent activation of downstream kinases involved in NF-κB and MAP kinase signaling (janssens2003functionaldiversityand pages 2-3, rebl2019atleasttwo pages 1-2). Although IRAK3 lacks the conventional catalytic activity of an active kinase, it has been shown to harbor an alternative enzymatic activity in the form of guanylate cyclase function. The production of cGMP via the guanylate cyclase center in IRAK3 may serve as an additional regulatory mechanism; increased cGMP levels have been correlated with modulation of inflammatory signaling in cell-based assays (freihat2019irak3modulatesdownstream pages 3-5, turek2023mutationsinthe pages 7-10). In contrast to mechanisms that involve post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation or ubiquitination—which are common regulatory strategies among active kinases—there is little evidence that IRAK3 is subject to extensive phosphorylation or ubiquitination events that alter its catalytic or regulatory functions (flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 43-47). Rather, the regulation of IRAK3 appears to depend on its structural conformation, dimerization state, and its interaction with other signaling proteins within the Myddosome, as well as the modulation of guanylate cyclase activity by the presence of specific metal ion cofactors (dardick2006plantandanimal pages 6-7, flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 20-24).\n\n7. Function  \nIRAK3 is best characterized as an inhibitory modulator in the innate immune system, where its primary function is to restrain inflammatory signaling. By binding to components of the Myddosome complex, specifically through interactions with IRAK1 and IRAK4, IRAK3 prevents the dissociation of these active kinases, thereby limiting the downstream activation of NF-κB and MAP kinase pathways that drive the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (janssens2003functionaldiversityand pages 2-3, flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 20-24). Its expression is largely restricted to monocytes and macrophages where regulation of TLR and IL1R signaling is critical for maintaining immune homeostasis. Studies have shown that IRAK3 expression increases in deactivated macrophages and in settings of endotoxin tolerance, providing a feedback mechanism to dampen overactive inflammatory responses (dardick2006plantandanimal pages 3-6, rebl2019atleasttwo pages 1-2). Beyond its role in inhibiting classical TLR/IL1R-mediated activation, IRAK3 has also been implicated in alternative signaling pathways. For instance, in the context of IL33-induced lung inflammation, IRAK3 positively regulates the expression of cytokine messenger RNAs including IL6, CSF3, CXCL2, and CCL5 in dendritic cells, thereby influencing the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory responses (Information section, PubMed:29686383). In addition to its canonical regulatory role via protein–protein interactions, the guanylate cyclase activity of IRAK3 may contribute to the fine-tuning of its inhibitory effects; the localized production of cGMP could act as an intracellular second messenger to modulate downstream signaling events, although the precise biological consequences of this activity remain under investigation (freihat2019irak3modulatesdownstream pages 2-3, turek2023mutationsinthe pages 7-10). Overall, IRAK3 functions as a critical checkpoint within the innate immune signaling cascade, ensuring that inflammatory responses are kept in balance to avoid excessive tissue damage or chronic inflammation (flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 20-24, dardick2006plantandanimal pages 9-10).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nIn addition to its role as a negative regulator of inflammatory signaling, modifications in the sequence of IRAK3 have been linked to alterations in its subcellular localization and enzymatic function. Mutations in amino acid residues in the vicinity of the guanylate cyclase center have been shown to adversely affect the ability of IRAK3 to produce cGMP, with some point mutations (for example, R372L) leading to a complete loss of guanylate cyclase activity (turek2023mutationsinthe pages 7-10). Furthermore, expression studies have revealed that IRAK3 is upregulated in certain pathological conditions, such as in the synovium of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and in tumor-infiltrating monocytes; these changes in expression are thought to contribute to immune tolerance and may favor tumor growth by modulating the inflammatory microenvironment (borghese2025irak3isupregulated pages 1-2, rhyasen2014irakfamilykinases pages 21-25). While selective small-molecule inhibitors specifically targeting IRAK3 have not been comprehensively characterized, there remains active interest in developing agents that can modulate IRAK3 function – either by enhancing its negative regulatory role in cases of chronic inflammation or by counteracting its upregulation in disease states where an inappropriate suppression of the immune response is observed (rhyasen2014irakfamilykinases pages 21-25). The dual nature of IRAK3—its inability to catalyze traditional phosphorylation reactions alongside its demonstrated guanylate cyclase activity—highlights an evolutionary divergence within the kinase family where regulatory control is achieved through non-catalytic mechanisms, a feature that underscores its unique contribution to immune regulation (bailey2014biochemicalanalysisof pages 33-37, freihat2019irak3modulatesdownstream pages 3-5).\n\n9.

Involved in Toll-like receptor (TLR) and IL-1R signaling pathways (PubMed:17878374). Is rapidly recruited by MYD88 to the receptor-signaling complex upon TLR activation to form the Myddosome together with IRAK2. Phosphorylates initially IRAK1, thus stimulating the kinase activity and intensive autophosphorylation of IRAK1. Phosphorylates E3 ubiquitin ligases Pellino proteins (PELI1, PELI2 and PELI3) to promote pellino-mediated polyubiquitination of IRAK1. Then, the ubiquitin-binding domain of IKBKG/NEMO binds to polyubiquitinated IRAK1 bringing together the IRAK1-MAP3K7/TAK1-TRAF6 complex and the NEMO-IKKA-IKKB complex. In turn, MAP3K7/TAK1 activates IKKs (CHUK/IKKA and IKBKB/IKKB) leading to NF-kappa-B nuclear translocation and activation. Alternatively, phosphorylates TIRAP to promote its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Phosphorylates NCF1 and regulates NADPH oxidase activation after LPS stimulation suggesting a similar mechanism during microbial infections**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nIRAK4 is a member of the interleukin-1 receptor‐associated kinase (IRAK) family, a group of serine/threonine kinases that evolved from the ancestral kinase common to the Toll/Pelle family. In mammals, the IRAK family comprises IRAK-1, IRAK-2, IRAK-M (also known as IRAK-3), and IRAK4, with IRAK4 being the most recently identified and evolutionarily conserved member that bears the closest homology to the Drosophila Pelle protein (bahia2015interleukin1receptorassociated pages 3-4, li2002irak4anovel pages 1-2). IRAK4 is classified within the broader human kinome as a serine/threonine kinase; its evolutionary lineage can be traced to early metazoans, with orthologs found across diverse mammalian species, indicating its indispensable role in innate immune signaling (gosu2012molecularevolutionand pages 1-2, bahia2015interleukin1receptorassociated pages 2-3). Additionally, phylogenetic analyses situate IRAK4 within the core group of signal-transducing kinases that mediate Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling—factoring into the evolutionary conservation from invertebrates to vertebrates (kim2008theroleof pages 15-20).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nIRAK4 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to serine and threonine residues on its substrate proteins. The general reaction can be written as: ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺. This ATP-dependent phosphorylation reaction is an essential step in the propagation of signaling cascades initiated by IL-1R and various TLRs (bahia2015interleukin1receptorassociated pages 5-8, wang2009irak4inhibitorsfor pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of IRAK4 requires ATP as the phosphate donor and is dependent on divalent metal ion cofactors such as Mg²⁺. These cofactors facilitate proper binding of ATP to the catalytic site of the kinase domain and are essential for the phosphoryl transfer reaction (bahia2015interleukin1receptorassociated pages 4-5, wang2009irak4inhibitorsfor pages 3-4).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nIRAK4 phosphorylates serine/threonine residues on downstream signaling proteins in the IL-1R/TLR cascade, most notably on IRAK1 and on E3 ubiquitin ligases of the Pellino family (PELI1, PELI2, and PELI3). Although the precise consensus substrate motif for IRAK4 has not been fully defined, its substrate recognition appears to rely on the configuration of its kinase domain, which differentiates it from conventional kinases by presenting unique loop and helix conformations within the activation segment (bahia2015interleukin1receptorassociated pages 3-4, patra2016recentprogressin pages 10-12, wang2009irak4inhibitorsfor pages 4-6).\n\n5. Structure  \nIRAK4 exhibits a well‐defined domain organization that is critical for its function. Its N-terminal region contains a death domain (DD) spanning approximately residues R20 to A104, which mediates protein–protein interactions necessary for recruitment to the Myddosome complex via the adaptor protein MyD88 (bahia2015interleukin1receptorassociated pages 3-4, li2002irak4anovel pages 3-5). Following the death domain, IRAK4 possesses a central kinase domain (approximately residues S186 to L454) that is responsible for its catalytic activity. This kinase domain displays a canonical serine/threonine kinase fold consisting of a smaller N-lobe—formed primarily of five antiparallel β-strands and an αC helix—and a larger C-lobe predominantly composed of α-helices. A unique feature of IRAK4 is its tyrosine residue (Tyr262) positioned in the ATP-binding pocket as the gatekeeper; this residue restricts access to a hydrophobic groove on the back of the pocket and distinguishes IRAK4 from many other kinases in the family (bahia2015interleukin1receptorassociated pages 4-5, wang2009irak4inhibitorsfor pages 3-4, kim2008theroleof pages 70-75). Activation loop autophosphorylation sites, including Thr342, Thr345, and Ser346, are present in the kinase domain and are critical for catalytic activation by stabilizing the active conformation (bahia2015interleukin1receptorassociated pages 4-5, patra2016recentprogressin pages 13-15). Structural studies, including high-resolution X-ray crystallographic analyses (e.g., PDB ID 2NRU), have confirmed these features and revealed conformational states corresponding to “helix C-in” active and “helix C-out” inactive forms (wang2009irak4inhibitorsfor pages 3-4, wang2019conformationalflexibilityand pages 2-3).\n\n6. Regulation  \nRegulatory control of IRAK4 occurs primarily through post-translational modifications, most notably autophosphorylation within its activation loop. Autophosphorylation at Thr342, Thr345, and Ser346 is necessary for full catalytic activation and for establishing the proper conformation of the kinase domain, thereby facilitating substrate recognition and phosphoryl transfer (bahia2015interleukin1receptorassociated pages 4-5, patra2016recentprogressin pages 13-15, srikanth2024irak4autophosphorylationcontrols pages 1-4). In addition, IRAK4 signaling is modulated by its recruitment into the Myddosome complex via its death domain, where interactions with the MyD88 adaptor protein and possibly IRAK1 enhance its phosphorylation activity. This assembly is crucial for temporal and spatial regulation of kinase activity, ensuring that IRAK4 is activated only upon receptor engagement (bahia2015interleukin1receptorassociated pages 8-11, kim2008theroleof pages 70-75, srikanth2024irak4autophosphorylationcontrols pages 6-8). Although specific external kinases have not been identified as direct regulators of IRAK4 phosphorylation, its intrinsic autophosphorylation events constitute the primary mechanism of its activation. Furthermore, conformational changes within the kinase domain—such as the shifting of the αC helix and the DFG motif—serve as allosteric regulators that determine whether IRAK4 adopts an active or inactive state (wang2019conformationalflexibilityand pages 16-18, kim2008theroleof pages 81-86).\n\n7. Function  \nIRAK4 plays a central role in initiating innate immune responses by acting as a proximal kinase in the TLR/IL-1R signaling pathways. Upon recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by TLRs or binding of interleukin-1 to its receptor, MyD88 is recruited to the activated receptor complex, and in turn, IRAK4 is rapidly brought into the so-called Myddosome complex (hynes2014advancesinthe pages 1-5, bahia2015interleukin1receptorassociated pages 2-3). In this assembled complex, IRAK4 phosphorylates IRAK1, which then undergoes autophosphorylation and ubiquitination; these modifications are essential for the recruitment of downstream molecules such as TRAF6 and the TAK1 complex. This signaling cascade culminates in the activation of the IKK complex and subsequent NF-κB nuclear translocation, leading to the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines (bahia2015interleukin1receptorassociated pages 8-11, patra2016recentprogressin pages 1-3, kim2008theroleof pages 25-35). In addition to phosphorylating IRAK1, IRAK4 also phosphorylates E3 ubiquitin ligase members of the Pellino family, thereby promoting Pellino-mediated polyubiquitination events that further propagate the downstream signaling pathway (bahia2015interleukin1receptorassociated pages 2-3, patra2016recentprogressin pages 13-15). IRAK4 is broadly expressed in cells of the innate immune system, including macrophages, dendritic cells, and monocytes, and its functional importance is underscored by studies linking IRAK4 deficiency in humans to recurrent pyogenic bacterial infections during early childhood (hynes2014advancesinthe pages 1-5, suzuki2005irakskeyregulatory pages 1-2).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nIRAK4 is a highly attractive therapeutic target for the development of small molecule inhibitors aimed at treating inflammatory and immune-related disorders. Numerous inhibitors, including ATP-competitive compounds, have been designed to specifically target the unique features of IRAK4’s ATP-binding pocket, particularly exploiting the presence of the tyrosine gatekeeper residue to achieve selectivity (wang2009irak4inhibitorsfor pages 12-12, seganish2016inhibitorsofinterleukin1 pages 22-26). Inhibitors of IRAK4 have shown promise in preclinical studies by effectively dampening excessive inflammatory responses in models of rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and certain cancers driven by aberrant MyD88 signaling (patra2016recentprogressin pages 1-3, seganish2016inhibitorsofinterleukin1 pages 1-6). IRAK4 has also been implicated in conditions where its kinase activity modulates the stability of mRNAs encoding inflammatory cytokines, further substantiating its role in the regulation of immune responses (kim2008theroleof pages 81-86, pereira2023regulationofinnate pages 8-9). Known disease mutations in IRAK4, often resulting in loss-of-function phenotypes, lead to immunodeficiency syndromes characterized by heightened susceptibility to infections, while gain-of-function alterations or overactivation have been linked to autoimmune and oncologic disorders (bahia2015interleukin1receptorassociated pages 8-11, flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 20-24).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nSerine/threonine‐protein kinase TAO1 (TAOK1), also known as MAP3K16, MARKK, and KIAA1361, belongs to the mammalian STE20 kinase family and is classified in the germinal center kinase (GCK) subfamily 8, a subgroup within the MAP3K family involved in stress‐activated pathways. TAOK1 is evolutionarily conserved across species, with orthologs observed in organisms ranging from Drosophila (where the ortholog is designated Tao1) to mammals, and it exhibits high sequence identity, particularly within its catalytic kinase domain, relative to its paralogs TAOK2 and TAOK3. This conservation is reflected in its retention of key catalytic motifs and regulatory regions that are characteristic of the STE20 family, as described in studies reporting on its evolution and phylogenetic placement (dulovicmahlow2019denovovariants pages 1-2, fang2020thediverseroles pages 1-3, thiriet2013cytoplasmicproteinserinethreonine pages 4-7).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nTAOK1 catalyzes the phosphorylation reaction typical of serine/threonine protein kinases. In this reaction, TAOK1 transfers a phosphate group from ATP to specific serine or threonine residues in substrate proteins, resulting in the conversion of ATP to ADP and the formation of a phosphorylated substrate along with the release of a proton. This catalytic activity positions TAOK1 as an essential mediator of phosphorylation cascades within the MAPK signaling pathways (dulovicmahlow2019denovovariants pages 2-2, fang2020thediverseroles pages 1-3).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of TAOK1 requires the presence of divalent cations, with Mg²⁺ being an essential cofactor that facilitates the binding of ATP and proper orientation of the phosphate donor within the active site of the kinase. This requirement for Mg²⁺ is a common feature among serine/threonine protein kinases, ensuring efficient catalysis during the phosphorylation process (thiriet2013cytoplasmicproteinserinethreonine pages 1-4).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nTAOK1 exhibits substrate specificity consistent with its role as a serine/threonine kinase involved in multiple signaling pathways. Key substrates of TAOK1 include MAP2K3 and MAP2K6, which are upstream activators of the p38/MAPK14 cascade; by phosphorylating these MAPKKs, TAOK1 facilitates stress-responsive signaling. Additionally, TAOK1 phosphorylates MARK2 at Thr208, thereby activating MARK2 kinase activity and promoting subsequent phosphorylation events on tau protein that lead to microtubule detachment and cytoskeleton destabilization. Although an explicit consensus substrate motif for TAOK1 has not been definitively delineated, structural studies of related STE family kinases suggest that TAOK1 likely recognizes serine/threonine residues followed by hydrophobic residues, which is in line with the substrate preferences observed in kinases such as TAO2 (goldsmith2007substrateanddocking pages 7-9, byeon2024pleiotropicfunctionsof pages 1-3).\n\n5. Structure  \nTAOK1 is a large, multidomain protein consisting of 1,001 amino acids, with a defined domain architecture that is critical to its function. The N-terminal region (approximately residues 28–281) comprises the catalytic kinase domain, which is highly conserved and contains key motifs such as the glycine-rich loop, the catalytic loop, and the activation segment. These structural features, including the hydrophobic spine and the positioning of the C-helix, facilitate ATP binding and phosphoryl transfer to substrates. Beyond the kinase domain, TAOK1 contains at least two coiled-coil motifs located approximately between residues 458–651 and 754–877; these motifs are implicated in protein–protein interactions and may contribute to the regulation of substrate docking and oligomerization. Furthermore, TAOK1’s overall three-dimensional architecture, as predicted by comparative modeling and corroborated by emerging AlphaFold models, reveals a central catalytic domain flanked by regulatory regions that likely mediate interactions with signaling proteins and adaptors required for its functional diversity in cells (dulovicmahlow2019denovovariants pages 3-4, fang2020thediverseroles pages 3-5, thiriet2013cytoplasmicproteinserinethreonine pages 11-14).\n\n6. Regulation  \nTAOK1 is subject to multiple regulatory mechanisms that modulate its kinase activity and downstream signaling functions. Phosphorylation is a key regulatory modification: TAOK1 undergoes auto- and trans-phosphorylation events, with its activation being contingent upon phosphorylation of residues within its activation loop. In the context of cellular stress and DNA damage, TAOK1 is activated as part of the p38/MAPK14 stress response, where upstream signals such as DNA damage stimuli trigger its phosphorylation and subsequent activation of downstream kinases MAP2K3 and MAP2K6. Regulatory proteins and interacting partners, including molecules like TESK1 and Spred1, have been reported to modulate TAOK1’s activity by either inhibiting or facilitating its kinase function. Furthermore, in experimental settings utilizing patient-derived fibroblasts and Drosophila models, loss-of-function variants in TAOK1 lead to a marked decrease in the levels of phosphorylated TAOK1, indicating that proper phosphorylation is critical for its activity and that disruption of these modifications can affect both cell cycle progression and neuronal development (dulovicmahlow2019denovovariants pages 4-6, fang2020thediverseroles pages 8-11, byeon2024pleiotropicfunctionsof pages 4-6, timm2006signalingfrommark pages 1-2).\n\n7. Function  \nTAOK1 plays diverse roles in cellular signaling and structural regulation. Functionally, TAOK1 acts as an upstream activator of the p38/MAPK14 stress-activated MAPK cascade through phosphorylation of MAP2K3 and MAP2K6, which in turn activate p38/MAPK14 under conditions of cellular stress and DNA damage. This signaling cascade is pivotal in the DNA damage response, particularly during the G2/M transition of the cell cycle. In addition to its role in stress signaling, TAOK1 regulates cytoskeletal dynamics by phosphorylating MARK2 at Thr208. Activated MARK2 phosphorylates tau protein, leading to its dissociation from microtubules and promoting microtubule disassembly, a process that is critical for neurite extension and proper brain morphology. TAOK1 also contributes to the regulation of apoptosis by activating the MAPK8/JNK cascade, which mediates morphological changes such as cell contraction, membrane blebbing, and the formation of apoptotic bodies. Expression studies indicate that TAOK1 is highly expressed in the central nervous system, where it plays an essential role in neuronal development and migration. The impact of TAOK1 on these pathways has been underscored by genetic studies that have identified de novo loss-of-function variants in TAOK1 in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders, characterized by developmental delay, muscular hypotonia, and dysregulated brain morphology (dulovicmahlow2019denovovariants pages 7-7, fang2020thediverseroles pages 5-8, byeon2024pleiotropicfunctionsof pages 1-3).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nTAOK1 is known by multiple aliases, including TAOK1, MAP3K16, MARKK, and KIAA1361, reflecting its discovery in various experimental contexts and its association with both MAP kinase and cytoskeletal regulatory pathways. While specific, highly selective inhibitors of TAOK1 have not yet been described in the literature, broader studies on TAO family kinases have reported the use of pan-kinase inhibitors such as staurosporine; however, these compounds lack specificity and thus limit their usefulness in dissecting TAOK1-specific functions. The clinical relevance of TAOK1 is highlighted by its involvement in neurodevelopment: de novo pathogenic variants in TAOK1 are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including developmental delay, microcephaly, and seizures, thereby establishing TAOK1 as a key player in the regulation of neuronal differentiation and survival. Additionally, TAOK1’s modulation of cytoskeletal stability via MARK2 and tau phosphorylation links it to processes that may contribute to neurodegenerative pathologies such as Alzheimer’s disease, although the primary association in the current literature is with developmental deficits rather than overt neurodegeneration. Therefore, further studies into TAOK1-specific inhibitors and regulatory mechanisms remain of high interest for both therapeutic targeting and the elucidation of kinase signaling cascades in health and disease (dulovicmahlow2019denovovariants pages 2-3, fang2020thediverseroles pages 11-13, thiriet2013cytoplasmicproteinserinethreonine pages 4-7, byeon2024pleiotropicfunctionsof pages 7-9).\n\n9.

May also negatively regulate cell cycle progression during unperturbed cell cycles. Following activation, phosphorylates numerous effectors preferentially at the consensus sequence [L-X-R-X-X-S/T] (PubMed:37943659). Regulates cell cycle checkpoint arrest through phosphorylation of CDC25A, CDC25B and CDC25C, inhibiting their activity. Inhibition of CDC25 phosphatase activity leads to increased inhibitory tyrosine phosphorylation of CDK-cyclin complexes and blocks cell cycle progression. May also phosphorylate NEK6 which is involved in G2/M cell cycle arrest. Regulates DNA repair through phosphorylation of BRCA2, enhancing the association of RAD51 with chromatin which promotes DNA repair by homologous recombination. Also stimulates the transcription of genes involved in DNA repair (including BRCA2) through the phosphorylation and activation of the transcription factor FOXM1. Regulates apoptosis through the phosphorylation of p53/TP53, MDM4 and PML. Phosphorylation of p53/TP53 at 'Ser-20' by CHEK2 may alleviate inhibition by MDM2, leading to accumulation of active p53/TP53. Phosphorylation of MDM4 may also reduce degradation of p53/TP53. Also controls the transcription of pro-apoptotic genes through phosphorylation of the transcription factor E2F1. Tumor suppressor, it may also have a DNA damage-independent function in mitotic spindle assembly by phosphorylating BRCA1. Its absence may be a cause of the chromosomal instability observed in some cancer cells. Promotes the CCAR2-SIRT1 association and is required for CCAR2-mediated SIRT1 inhibition (PubMed:25361978). Under oxidative stress, promotes ATG7 ubiquitination by phosphorylating the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM32 at 'Ser-55' leading to positive regulation of the autophagosme assembly (PubMed:37943659)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nSerine/threonine‐protein kinase Chk2 (CHEK2) is a highly conserved checkpoint kinase that can be traced back to the early eukaryotic lineage. In yeast, its homolog Rad53 provides the evolutionary basis for mammalian Chk2, and the protein is conserved across all metazoans. This conservation reflects its central role in the DNA damage response signal transduction cascade. Within the human kinome, Chk2 is classified as a member of the checkpoint kinase family, and its evolutionary relationships link it closely with other damage‐responsive kinases such as Chk1, while remaining distinct from the structurally related, yet functionally divergent, kinases involved in cell cycle progression and stress signaling (sechi2022minorkinaseswith pages 9-10, benada2017molecularmechanismsof pages 14-17).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nChk2 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine and threonine residues on specific substrate proteins. As with other serine/threonine kinases, its enzymatic activity can be summarized by the reaction: ATP + protein (with L-serine/threonine) → ADP + protein phosphorylated at serine/threonine + H⁺ (vugt2010amitoticphosphorylation pages 1-2, boutros2007cdc25phosphatasesin pages 3-4).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nChk2 requires divalent metal ion cofactors for its catalytic activity. Similar to most protein kinases, Mg²⁺ is essential to stabilize the binding of ATP in the active site and to facilitate the phosphoryl transfer reaction (ferrari2006proteinkinasescontrolling pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nChk2 displays a substrate specificity that is guided by its preference for a consensus phosphorylation motif. The protein preferentially phosphorylates substrates containing the consensus sequence [L-X-R-X-X-S/T], where phosphorylation occurs on the serine or threonine residue (Information; kim2017analysisofsomatic pages 11-12; boutros2007cdc25phosphatasesin pages 3-4, johnson2023anatlasof pages 4-5). This motif specificity directs Chk2 toward substrates pivotal for DNA damage-induced cell cycle control, such as members of the CDC25 phosphatase family, regulatory factors like p53, and proteins involved in homologous recombination like BRCA2 (benada2017molecularmechanismsof pages 14-17).\n\n5. Structure  \nChk2 comprises several distinct domains that contribute to its regulatory and catalytic functions. The N-terminal region contains the SQ/TQ cluster domain (SCD), which is enriched in serine-glutamine and threonine-glutamine motifs; these serve as key phosphorylation sites for upstream DNA damage sensors such as ATM and ATR (sechi2022minorkinaseswith pages 9-10). Adjacent to the SCD is the forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, which is essential for mediating phospho-dependent interactions between Chk2 molecules, thus supporting dimerization and further autophosphorylation events. The C-terminal half houses the catalytic serine/threonine kinase domain responsible for the phosphoryl transfer reaction. Structural studies and models have highlighted features such as the activation loop (T-loop), which undergoes conformational changes upon phosphorylation at residues including threonine 383, threonine 387, and serine 516; these modifications are required for full kinase activity (vugt2010amitoticphosphorylation pages 11-13, sechi2022minorkinaseswith pages 9-10). A nuclear localization signal (NLS) within the C-terminal region further ensures that Chk2 is appropriately localized to the nucleus where it can access DNA damage foci (sechi2022minorkinaseswith pages 9-10).\n\n6. Regulation  \nActivation of Chk2 is tightly controlled by several post-translational modifications and protein-protein interactions that occur predominantly in response to DNA double-strand breaks. Activation is initiated primarily by ATM kinase, which phosphorylates Chk2 at threonine 68. This event facilitates subsequent autophosphorylation events on threonine 383, threonine 387, and serine 516 in the activation loop, culminating in the formation of an active monomeric kinase (vugt2010amitoticphosphorylation pages 11-11, benada2017molecularmechanismsof pages 14-17). The FHA domain also mediates Chk2 dimerization via interactions with phosphorylated residues on adjacent molecules, an interaction essential for amplifying Chk2 activity (sechi2022minorkinaseswith pages 9-10). Additionally, Chk2 activity is modulated by protein phosphatases such as PP2A and Wip1, which dephosphorylate specific residues to attenuate kinase activity, thereby contributing to checkpoint termination following DNA repair (benada2017molecularmechanismsof pages 69-70, boutros2007cdc25phosphatasesin pages 12-12). Other regulatory influences include input from mitotic kinases like Plk1 and the p38/MK2 pathway, which integrate cell cycle signals to fine-tune Chk2 function during recovery from DNA damage (vugt2010amitoticphosphorylation pages 19-20, sechi2022minorkinaseswith pages 20-22).\n\n7. Function  \nChk2 plays a central role in the DNA damage response (DDR) and in maintaining genomic stability. Upon activation by ATM following double-strand breaks, Chk2 phosphorylates a variety of substrates to enforce cell cycle checkpoints and promote DNA repair. One of its principal targets is the CDC25 family of phosphatases (CDC25A, CDC25B, and CDC25C); phosphorylation of these enzymes results in their inactivation, leading to the accumulation of inhibitory phosphorylation on CDK-cyclin complexes and subsequent cell cycle arrest, particularly at the G1/S and G2/M transitions (boutros2007cdc25phosphatasesin pages 3-4, benada2017molecularmechanismsof pages 14-17). In addition, Chk2 phosphorylates and stabilizes the tumor suppressor p53 by targeting it at serine 20, thereby preventing its degradation by MDM2 and facilitating the transcription of pro-apoptotic and cell cycle regulatory genes (benada2017molecularmechanismsof pages 14-17, xu2021regulationofthe pages 4-5). Chk2 is also involved in regulating DNA repair through phosphorylation of BRCA2, which enhances RAD51 chromatin association and promotes homologous recombination repair. Furthermore, it stimulates the transcription of DNA repair genes by phosphorylating and activating transcription factors such as FOXM1, and it modulates apoptosis via phosphorylation of factors including MDM4 and PML. In addition to these canonical DDR functions, Chk2 has been implicated in the regulation of cytokinesis and may phosphorylate targets such as NEK6 to enforce a G2/M delay even under unperturbed conditions (benada2017molecularmechanismsof pages 14-17, boutros2007cdc25phosphatasesin pages 12-12, sechi2022minorkinaseswith pages 5-6).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nChk2 functions as a crucial tumor suppressor, and its inactivation through mutation or deregulation is associated with increased genomic instability and predisposition to cancers such as breast, colon, ovarian, and prostate cancers. Several small-molecule inhibitors targeting Chk2 have been identified, for example, CCT241533 has been reported as a potent and selective Chk2 inhibitor, which can enhance the cytotoxicity of PARP inhibitors and might serve as an adjuvant therapy in cancer treatment (kumar2017analysisofsomatic pages 11-12). The kinase also forms part of a broader network of DDR proteins, interacting with ATM, ATR, and checkpoint kinases such as Chk1. Disorders in Chk2 signaling not only compromise genome integrity but also are implicated in the failure of apoptosis and abnormal mitotic spindle assembly, further contributing to tumorigenesis (benada2017molecularmechanismsof pages 17-20, vugt2010amitoticphosphorylation pages 2-3). Its precise regulation by upstream kinases and phosphatases underscores the delicate balance necessary for proper cell cycle control and the potential for targeted therapeutic intervention in cancers that exhibit defects in the DNA damage response (boutros2007cdc25phosphatasesin pages 2-3, yazinski2016functionsregulationand pages 1-2).\n\n9.

Exhibits kinase activity-dependent functions that regulate cell death and kinase-independent scaffold functions regulating inflammatory signaling and cell survival (PubMed:11101870, PubMed:19524512, PubMed:19524513, PubMed:29440439, PubMed:30988283). Has kinase-independent scaffold functions: upon binding of TNF to TNFR1, RIPK1 is recruited to the TNF-R1 signaling complex (TNF-RSC also known as complex I) where it acts as a scaffold protein promoting cell survival, in part, by activating the canonical NF-kappa-B pathway (By similarity). Kinase activity is essential to regulate necroptosis and apoptosis, two parallel forms of cell death: upon activation of its protein kinase activity, regulates assembly of two death-inducing complexes, namely complex IIa (RIPK1-FADD-CASP8), which drives apoptosis, and the complex IIb (RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL), which drives necroptosis (By similarity). RIPK1 is required to limit CASP8-dependent TNFR1-induced apoptosis (By similarity). In normal conditions, RIPK1 acts as an inhibitor of RIPK3-dependent necroptosis, a process mediated by RIPK3 component of complex IIb, which catalyzes phosphorylation of MLKL upon induction by ZBP1 (PubMed:19524512, PubMed:19524513, PubMed:29440439, PubMed:30988283). Inhibits RIPK3-mediated necroptosis via FADD-mediated recruitment of CASP8, which cleaves RIPK1 and limits TNF-induced necroptosis (PubMed:19524512, PubMed:19524513, PubMed:29440439, PubMed:30988283). Required to inhibit apoptosis and necroptosis during embryonic development: acts by preventing the interaction of TRADD with FADD thereby limiting aberrant activation of CASP8 (By similarity). In addition to apoptosis and necroptosis, also involved in inflammatory response by promoting transcriptional production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL6) (PubMed:31827280, PubMed:31827281). Phosphorylates RIPK3: RIPK1 and RIPK3 undergo reciprocal auto- and trans-phosphorylation (PubMed:19524513). Phosphorylates DAB2IP at 'Ser-728' in a TNF-alpha-dependent manner, and thereby activates the MAP3K5-JNK apoptotic cascade (PubMed:15310755, PubMed:17389591). Required for ZBP1-induced NF-kappa-B activation in response to DNA damage (By similarity)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nRIPK1 is a member of the receptor‐interacting protein (RIP) kinase family, a subgroup of serine/threonine protein kinases that are evolutionarily conserved among metazoans. Orthologs of RIPK1 can be identified in all vertebrate species, and more broadly in eukaryotes, indicating that the kinase emerged early in evolution along with the other members of the TNF receptor-associated kinases. RIPK1 is closely related to other members of the RIP kinase family (e.g., RIPK2 and RIPK3) that share structural features such as the kinase domain and interaction motifs, although the family has diversified evolutionarily to adopt distinct functional roles such as mediating necroptosis versus NF-κB activation (engin2021proteinkinasemediateddecision pages 15-17, bailey2016necroptosisanovel pages 33-36).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nRIPK1 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to a serine or threonine residue on its substrate protein. The overall chemical reaction can be represented as:  \nATP + [substrate protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [substrate protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (johnson2023anatlasof pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of RIPK1, as is typical for serine-threonine kinases, requires Mg²⁺ as a critical cofactor. Mg²⁺ ions stabilize the negative charges on ATP, facilitating proper binding and catalysis at the active site of RIPK1 (kugler2024impactofprotein pages 27-28).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nGlobal profiling of human serine/threonine kinases has revealed that RIPK1 falls within a specific substrate motif group. Although the precise consensus substrate motif for RIPK1 is not explicitly detailed in every report, large-scale peptide library screens indicate that RIP kinases, including RIPK1, are grouped with kinases showing motifs characterized by basic residues flanking the phospho-acceptor site on both the N-terminal and the C-terminal sides, with a dominant preference for an aromatic residue at the +3 position relative to the phosphorylated serine or threonine (johnson2023anatlasof pages 2-3). These findings are derived from position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) analyses that cluster kinases with shared motif preferences, thus suggesting that RIPK1’s substrate specificity is defined by a unique pattern of positively charged and aromatic residues in the vicinity of the phosphorylation site (johnson2023anatlasof pages 9-10).\n\n5. Structure  \nRIPK1 is a ~74 kDa protein that exhibits a modular structural organization comprised of three distinct domains. The N-terminal region contains the kinase domain that is responsible for its serine/threonine phosphorylation activity; this domain displays typical kinase features such as the conserved ATP-binding cleft, an activation loop (T-loop), a hydrophobic spine, and a C-helix critical for positioning catalytic residues. Following the kinase domain, RIPK1 possesses an intermediate domain that harbors a RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM), which is essential for mediating homotypic interactions with other RHIM-containing proteins such as RIPK3 and ZBP1. The C-terminal region of RIPK1 contains a death domain (DD) that facilitates interactions with death receptors and adaptor proteins (e.g., TRADD, FADD) during the assembly of TNF receptor-signaling complexes (yeo2018regulationofnuclearfactor pages 35-39, engin2021proteinkinasemediateddecision pages 9-12). In several structural studies and crystallographic data (for example, the published structure in PDB: 6HHO referenced in related discussions), the kinase domain of RIPK1 demonstrates the canonical bilobal architecture common to protein kinases, with a smaller N-lobe usually made up of β-sheets and a larger C-lobe dominated by α-helices. Unique structural features of RIPK1 include the presence of regulatory phosphorylation sites within the activation loop and conformational changes upon binding to inhibitors that have been characterized using protein–small molecule interaction studies (kugler2024impactofprotein pages 9-11, yeo2018regulationofnuclearfactor pages 39-43).\n\n6. Regulation  \nRIPK1 is subject to multifaceted regulatory mechanisms that modulate its function in cell death and inflammatory signaling pathways. Post-translational modifications are a hallmark of RIPK1 regulation. Phosphorylation events, such as autophosphorylation and phosphorylation by other kinases (notably by MK2 within the TNF receptor 1 complex), play central roles; for example, phosphorylation at serine 166 is frequently used as a readout of RIPK1 catalytic activation (bailey2016necroptosisanovel pages 113-116, engin2021proteinkinasemediateddecision pages 30-31). Conversely, phosphorylation at other sites modulates its kinase-dependent pro-death activity. Ubiquitination is another key layer of regulation. Upon engagement of TNF receptors, RIPK1 is recruited to the TNFR1 signaling complex (complex I) where it is polyubiquitinated with K63- and M1-linked ubiquitin chains by enzymes including the E3 ubiquitin ligases cIAP1/2 and the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC). Ubiquitination serves to scaffold the recruitment of downstream kinases such as TAK1 and the IKK complex that drive NF-κB activation, thereby promoting cell survival (dostert2019thetnffamily pages 5-6, engin2021proteinkinasemediateddecision pages 34-35). When deubiquitinated by enzymes like CYLD, RIPK1 is released from the membrane complex and can participate in the formation of cytosolic death-inducing complexes. Additionally, RIPK1 is proteolytically cleaved by caspase-8 in certain contexts, which limits its ability to propagate necroptotic signaling and thereby acts as a regulatory checkpoint for apoptosis versus necroptosis (samir2020thepanoptosomea pages 3-4, engin2021proteinkinasemediateddecision pages 24-26).\n\n7. Function  \nRIPK1 plays a dual role depending on its mode of activity. As a serine/threonine kinase, its enzyme activity is essential for orchestrating programmed cell death modalities, specifically apoptosis and necroptosis. Upon activation by stimuli such as TNF-α, RIPK1 becomes part of the TNF receptor 1 signaling complex where its kinase activity facilitates the assembly of distinct death-inducing complexes. In complex IIa, RIPK1 engages FADD and caspase-8 to drive Caspase-8-mediated apoptosis. Alternatively, under circumstances where caspase-8 activity is impaired, RIPK1 partners with RIPK3 and MLKL to form the necrosome (complex IIb), thereby promoting necroptosis—a form of regulated necrosis (bailey2016necroptosisanovel pages 33-36, engin2021proteinkinasemediateddecision pages 26-28). Independently of its kinase activity, RIPK1 can function as a scaffold that facilitates the recruitment of downstream signaling molecules such as TRAF2 and adaptor proteins, leading to the activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway and transcriptional production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6 (IL-6) (bailey2016necroptosisanovel pages 113-116, engin2021proteinkinasemediateddecision pages 30-31). This scaffold function is particularly important during TNF receptor-mediated cell survival signaling, as it inhibits aberrant caspase-8 activation and preserves cell viability during embryonic development (engin2021proteinkinasemediateddecision pages 15-17, yeo2018regulationofnuclearfactor pages 35-39). Furthermore, RIPK1 is implicated in additional signaling pathways, for example promoting ZBP1-induced NF-κB activation in response to DNA damage, and phosphorylating downstream proteins such as RIPK3 and DAB2IP, thereby linking inflammatory and apoptotic cascades (Information section, PubMed:15310755; engin2021proteinkinasemediateddecision pages 28-30).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nPharmacological inhibition of RIPK1 kinase activity has been explored for therapeutic intervention in various pathological conditions including inflammatory diseases, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and certain cancers. Inhibitors such as Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) and its derivatives (e.g., Nec-1s, GSK547) have been employed experimentally to block RIPK1-dependent necroptosis and attenuate inflammation (kugler2024impactofprotein pages 11-12, mifflin2020receptorinteractingproteinkinase pages 2-3). Additionally, mutations that affect RIPK1 cleavage by caspase-8 have been associated with dominant autoinflammatory phenotypes, underscoring the clinical relevance of maintaining balanced RIPK1 activity. Aberrant RIPK1 function, whether due to dysregulation of its kinase activity or disruptions in its scaffold function, has been implicated in diseases characterized by excessive cell death or chronic inflammation, including immune disorders and neurodegenerative conditions (samir2020thepanoptosomea pages 11-12, zare2022theroleof pages 62-65). The dual nature of RIPK1’s functions—kinase-dependent promotion of apoptosis and necroptosis versus kinase-independent support of NF-κB signaling—makes it a unique and critical regulatory node in cell fate decisions (Information section; engin2021proteinkinasemediateddecision pages 31-33).\n\n9.

Acts as a key effector of NOD1 and NOD2 signaling pathways: upon activation by bacterial peptidoglycans, NOD1 and NOD2 oligomerize and recruit RIPK2 via CARD-CARD domains, leading to the formation of RIPK2 filaments (PubMed:17054981, PubMed:17562858, PubMed:21123652, PubMed:22607974, PubMed:28656966, PubMed:29452636, PubMed:30026309). Once recruited, RIPK2 autophosphorylates and undergoes 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination by E3 ubiquitin ligases XIAP, BIRC2 and BIRC3, as well as 'Met-1'-linked (linear) polyubiquitination by the LUBAC complex, becoming a scaffolding protein for downstream effectors (PubMed:22607974, PubMed:28545134, PubMed:29452636, PubMed:30026309, PubMed:30279485, PubMed:30478312). 'Met-1'-linked polyubiquitin chains attached to RIPK2 recruit IKBKG/NEMO, which undergoes 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination in a RIPK2-dependent process (PubMed:17562858, PubMed:22607974, PubMed:29452636, PubMed:30026309). 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains attached to RIPK2 serve as docking sites for TAB2 and TAB3 and mediate the recruitment of MAP3K7/TAK1 to IKBKG/NEMO, inducing subsequent activation of IKBKB/IKKB (PubMed:18079694). In turn, NF-kappa-B is released from NF-kappa-B inhibitors and translocates into the nucleus where it activates the transcription of hundreds of genes involved in immune response, growth control, or protection against apoptosis (PubMed:18079694). The protein kinase activity is dispensable for the NOD1 and NOD2 signaling pathways (PubMed:29452636, PubMed:30026309). Contributes to the tyrosine phosphorylation of the guanine exchange factor ARHGEF2 through Src tyrosine kinase leading to NF-kappa-B activation by NOD2 (PubMed:21887730). Also involved in adaptive immunity: plays a role during engagement of the T-cell receptor (TCR) in promoting BCL10 phosphorylation and subsequent NF-kappa-B activation (PubMed:14638696). Plays a role in the inactivation of RHOA in response to NGFR signaling (PubMed:26646181)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nRIPK2, also known as CARDIAK, RICK, or RIP2, belongs to the receptor‐interacting protein kinase family. Within the human kinome, RIPK2 is classified as one of the five genuine RIP kinases (RIPK1–RIPK5), a grouping that is supported by comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses. Orthologs of RIPK2 are widely conserved across vertebrate species, and its kinase domain shows strong evolutionary conservation relative to other members of the RIPK family. In phylogenetic trees, RIPK2 clusters with kinases such as RIPK1 and RIPK3, and its evolutionary relationships trace back to early gene duplication events that marked the divergence of vertebrate immune signaling components (lv2022comparativeandevolutionary pages 4-6, urwylerrosselet2023functionsofthe pages 1-3). The conservation of the kinase domain, combined with the presence of a C-terminal CARD domain unique to RIPK2 among the RIP kinases, underscores its evolutionary specialization for mediating innate immune responses through specific protein–protein interactions. This group of kinases is derived from the core set of kinases that emerged in early eukaryotic evolution and have since undergone diversification to take on distinct roles in cell signaling.\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nRIPK2 catalyzes phosphorylation reactions that involve the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl (-OH) group of target amino acid residues. The general chemical reaction can be represented as:  \n ATP + [protein]-(L-serine, L-threonine, or L-tyrosine) → ADP + [protein]-(phosphorylated serine/threonine/tyrosine) + H⁺  \nIn the case of RIPK2, the reaction is principally involved in autophosphorylation, wherein the enzyme phosphorylates residues within its own activation loop and other regulatory regions, such as serine 176 and tyrosine 474 among additional sites. This catalytic activity relies on the intrinsic kinase domain of RIPK2 and is central to its function as a signaling mediator in pathways that modulate inflammatory responses (pellegrini2017structuresofthe pages 1-2, zare2022theroleof pages 35-39).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of RIPK2, similar to many protein kinases, depends on the presence of divalent metal ions. Specifically, Mg²⁺ acts as an essential cofactor, coordinating the phosphate groups of ATP within the active site of the kinase domain. This requirement is typical of serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases, where Mg²⁺ stabilizes the negative charges of the phosphate moieties during the phosphoryl transfer reaction (pham2023recentadvancesin pages 1-3, pellegrini2017structuresofthe pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nRIPK2 displays dual-specificity kinase activity; it is capable of phosphorylating serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues. While no definitive consensus substrate motif has been universally ascribed to RIPK2 based solely on published substrate atlases, its autophosphorylation events indicate a substrate specificity that allows modification of multiple residues within its activation loop and possibly on interacting protein substrates. Experimental evidence has identified serine 176 and tyrosine 474 as prominent phospho-acceptor sites, among others, suggesting that the substrate recognition of RIPK2 may be influenced by the surrounding amino acid context in these regions. Overall, RIPK2 appears to preferentially autophosphorylate within its kinase domain activation segment, providing a regulatory mechanism rather than acting on an invariant linear motif found in conventional substrate proteins (topal2021ripk2nodsto pages 6-11, zare2022theroleof pages 35-39).\n\n5. Structure  \nRIPK2 is characterized by a distinct multi-domain architecture that underpins its dual roles as an enzyme and scaffolding protein. The protein comprises an N-terminal kinase domain (approximately residues 1–310) that adopts a typical bilobal structure consisting of an N-lobe and a C-lobe. The kinase domain houses key catalytic features such as the glycine-rich loop, the DFG motif within the activation loop, conserved catalytic residues (including a critical lysine involved in ATP binding and an aspartate crucial for catalysis), and regulatory elements like the hydrophobic spine and the C-helix. High-resolution crystallographic studies and cryo-electron microscopy data have revealed that, upon activation, RIPK2 undergoes conformational rearrangements that align the catalytic motifs optimally for ATP binding and phosphotransfer (pellegrini2017structuresofthe pages 11-13, chirieleison2016syntheticbiologyreveals pages 9-11).\n\nImmediately following the kinase domain is an intermediate, less structurally defined region, whose flexibility may contribute to the dynamic regulation of RIPK2’s catalytic activity and protein–protein interactions. The C-terminal CARD (Caspase Recruitment Domain) is responsible for mediating homotypic CARD–CARD interactions with NOD1 and NOD2 receptors. These interactions are critical for the formation of higher-order signaling platforms, known as RIPK2 filaments or “RIPosomes”, which facilitate downstream signaling events. Structural insights have also uncovered a regulatory hydrophobic pocket within the kinase domain, notably involving residues such as K209 and I212, which is essential for binding to the E3 ubiquitin ligase XIAP. This pocket modulates ubiquitination and, consequently, the signaling competency of RIPK2 (boyle2014insightsintothe pages 5-6, heim2020aregulatoryinterface pages 23-28, lethier2022structuralanalysisshows pages 27-29).\n\nDimerization of the kinase domain has been observed in both active and inhibitor-bound crystal structures, suggesting that RIPK2 forms symmetrical or asymmetrical dimers that are necessary for autophosphorylation via trans mechanisms. Such dimer formations position the activation loops of the monomers in proximity, thereby facilitating efficient phosphate transfer from ATP to specific residues (pellegrini2017structuresofthe pages 7-9, lv2022comparativeandevolutionary pages 9-10).\n\n6. Regulation  \nRIPK2 is subject to complex regulation involving multiple post-translational modifications, which modulate both its kinase activity and scaffolding functions. Autophosphorylation is a central regulatory event in which RIPK2 phosphorylates key residues within its kinase domain, such as serine 176 and tyrosine 474, leading to conformational changes that promote its active state. In addition to autophosphorylation, RIPK2 is regulated by ubiquitination. Lysine 209, among other lysine residues, is a critical site for Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination, which serves as a docking signal for downstream effectors and facilitates the assembly of signaling complexes. The E3 ubiquitin ligases XIAP, BIRC2, and BIRC3 mediate this ubiquitination, whereas the LUBAC complex adds Met-1-linked polyubiquitin chains that further enhance signal propagation and facilitate NF-κB activation. These modifications are reversible, and deubiquitinases have been implicated in counteracting the ubiquitination events, thereby preventing prolonged or excessive signal activation (hein2019nodsignalingand pages 5-6, heim2020aregulatoryinterface pages 9-12, topal2021ripk2nodsto pages 6-11).\n\nOther regulatory mechanisms include conformational modulation via dimerization and the potential influence of phosphorylation on regions that interact with other regulatory proteins. Although kinase activity per se is not strictly essential for downstream NOD signaling—as underscored by studies where kinase-dead mutants retain scaffolding capabilities—the catalytic activity of RIPK2 contributes to its stability and to the fine-tuning of ubiquitin-dependent signaling events. Thus, the integrated effects of autophosphorylation, ubiquitination, dimerization, and possibly additional regulatory inputs determine the overall signaling output mediated by RIPK2 (boyle2014insightsintothe pages 6-7, shen2025currentadvanceson pages 2-3, zare2022theroleof pages 35-39).\n\n7. Function  \nRIPK2 functions as a key mediator in innate and adaptive immune responses by serving as a critical effector downstream of the intracellular pattern recognition receptors NOD1 and NOD2. Upon detection of bacterial peptidoglycan fragments, NOD1 and NOD2 oligomerize and recruit RIPK2 through homotypic CARD–CARD interactions. This recruitment triggers RIPK2 activation via dimerization and autophosphorylation, which in turn leads to the polyubiquitination of RIPK2 by E3 ligases such as XIAP. The polyubiquitin chains on RIPK2 serve as scaffolds to recruit and activate downstream signaling complexes, culminating in the activation of key transcription factors such as NF-κB and the MAPK pathways. Through these signaling cascades, RIPK2 orchestrates the transcriptional activation of a wide array of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and other immune response genes (boyle2014insightsintothe pages 5-6, pham2023recentadvancesin pages 1-3, topal2021ripk2nodsto pages 6-11).\n\nIn addition to its role in innate immunity, RIPK2 is involved in adaptive immune modulation. It participates in T-cell receptor signaling, contributing to the phosphorylation of substrates such as BCL10, which is linked to NF-κB activation in adaptive immune cells. Moreover, RIPK2 has been implicated in signaling pathways that regulate cell survival and apoptosis and is thought to contribute to processes such as autophagy through its interactions with diverse regulatory proteins. Despite evidence that the kinase catalytic activity of RIPK2 may be dispensable for certain signaling outputs, the enzyme’s autophosphorylation and ubiquitination events serve as crucial regulators of its activity and cell signaling functions (boyle2014insightsintothe pages 5-6, chirieleison2016syntheticbiologyreveals pages 1-2, zare2022theroleof pages 28-32).\n\nRIPK2 is widely expressed, with significant levels in immune effector cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and various epithelial cell types. Its expression and functional activity are particularly important in tissues exposed to microbial pathogens as well as in pathological conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, certain cancers, and autoimmune disorders. The ability of RIPK2 to integrate signals from NOD receptors to downstream effectors places it at a critical juncture in the control of both inflammatory responses and cellular homeostasis (pham2023recentadvancesin pages 1-3, zare2022theroleofa pages 28-32).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nRIPK2 is the subject of intense pharmacological investigation given its pivotal role in mediating inflammatory signaling cascades. Small-molecule inhibitors targeting the ATP-binding pocket of the kinase domain have been developed, and these compounds typically exert their effects by disrupting the interaction between RIPK2 and its E3 ubiquitin ligase partners, particularly XIAP. Such inhibitors not only block the autophosphorylation activity of RIPK2 but also impair the assembly of downstream ubiquitin-dependent signaling complexes. This therapeutic approach holds promise in treating a range of inflammatory conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease, asthma, and potentially certain cancers where aberrant NOD signaling is implicated (tignoaranjuez2014invivoinhibition pages 12-13, pham2023recentadvancesin pages 4-6).\n\nAdditionally, mutations and polymorphisms in components of the NOD-RIPK2-XIAP signaling axis have been linked to various pathological states. For example, genetic alterations in NOD2 are strong risk factors for Crohn’s disease, and deficiencies in XIAP have been associated with very early onset inflammatory bowel disease. Although mutational analyses of RIPK2 itself are less common, the regulatory interplay between its kinase activity, autophosphorylation state, and post-translational modification by ubiquitin underscores its potential as a clinical biomarker and therapeutic target in diseases characterized by dysregulated inflammatory responses (topal2021ripk2nodsto pages 6-11, zare2022theroleof pages 62-65).\n\n9.

Necroptosis, a programmed cell death process in response to death-inducing TNF-alpha family members, is triggered by RIPK3 following activation by ZBP1 (PubMed:19524512, PubMed:19524513, PubMed:22265413, PubMed:22265414, PubMed:22421439, PubMed:29883609, PubMed:32298652). Activated RIPK3 forms a necrosis-inducing complex and mediates phosphorylation of MLKL, promoting MLKL localization to the plasma membrane and execution of programmed necrosis characterized by calcium influx and plasma membrane damage (PubMed:19524512, PubMed:19524513, PubMed:22265413, PubMed:22265414, PubMed:22421439, PubMed:25316792, PubMed:29883609). In addition to TNF-induced necroptosis, necroptosis can also take place in the nucleus in response to orthomyxoviruses infection: following ZBP1 activation, which senses double-stranded Z-RNA structures, nuclear RIPK3 catalyzes phosphorylation and activation of MLKL, promoting disruption of the nuclear envelope and leakage of cellular DNA into the cytosol (By similarity). Also regulates apoptosis: apoptosis depends on RIPK1, FADD and CASP8, and is independent of MLKL and RIPK3 kinase activity (By similarity). Phosphorylates RIPK1: RIPK1 and RIPK3 undergo reciprocal auto- and trans-phosphorylation (PubMed:19524513). In some cell types, also able to restrict viral replication by promoting cell death-independent responses (By similarity). In response to Zika virus infection in neurons, promotes a cell death-independent pathway that restricts viral replication: together with ZBP1, promotes a death-independent transcriptional program that modifies the cellular metabolism via up-regulation expression of the enzyme ACOD1/IRG1 and production of the metabolite itaconate (By similarity). Itaconate inhibits the activity of succinate dehydrogenase, generating a metabolic state in neurons that suppresses replication of viral genomes (By similarity). RIPK3 binds to and enhances the activity of three metabolic enzymes: GLUL, GLUD1, and PYGL (PubMed:19498109). These metabolic enzymes may eventually stimulate the tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, which could result in enhanced ROS production (PubMed:19498109)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nRIPK3 is a member of the receptor‐interacting protein kinase family within the serine/threonine kinase branch of the human kinome. Orthologs of RIPK3 are identified across vertebrate species, although its presence is not universal; for example, lineage‐specific losses have been reported in birds and in some early diverging mammals. Phylogenetic analyses place RIPK3 in a sub‐cluster with RIPK1, RIPK2, RIPK4 and RIPK5, whereas more distantly related members such as RIPK6 and RIPK7 form a separate clade, highlighting both its evolutionary conservation in mammals and the divergent paths in other organisms (dondelinger2016anevolutionaryperspective pages 2-4, lv2022comparativeandevolutionary pages 1-3). Its evolution appears to be driven by selective pressures from host–pathogen interactions, with positive selection detected in some mammalian clades, a finding that underlines the functional importance of RIPK3 in innate immune responses (fay2025evolutionaryandfunctional pages 1-4, brault2017controlleddetonationevolution pages 13-17).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nRIPK3 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to specific serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. The canonical reaction can be described as: ATP + [protein]‐(L‐serine or L‐threonine) → ADP + [protein]‐(L‐serine/threonine)‐phosphate + H⁺ (cook2014ripk1andripk3induced pages 12-12). This phosphorylation event is central to RIPK3’s ability to propagate necroptotic signaling, particularly by modifying its downstream substrate, mixed lineage kinase domain‐like protein (MLKL) (shi2018targetingreceptorinteractingserinethreonineprotein pages 68-75).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of RIPK3 is dependent on the presence of ATP, which serves as the phosphate donor, and it requires Mg²⁺ as an essential cofactor. This requirement is consistent with its classification among serine/threonine kinases, where Mg²⁺ ions facilitate proper coordination of the ATP molecule within the active site (chiou2025thekinasedomain pages 4-7, martens2020inhibitorstargetingripk1ripk3 pages 2-4).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nRIPK3 exhibits substrate specificity that is critical for its role in necroptosis. Its principal substrate is MLKL, whose phosphorylation by RIPK3 at specific residues (for example, human Ser227; mouse T231/S232) enables MLKL to oligomerize, translocate to the plasma membrane, and induce membrane disruption. Although a detailed consensus motif for RIPK3 substrates is not universally established, the kinase displays a preference for phosphorylating serine/threonine residues within regions that facilitate conformational changes required for necroptotic complex assembly (shi2018targetingreceptorinteractingserinethreonineprotein pages 63-68, liu2021ripk3signalingand pages 4-6). Other substrates reported include proteins involved in metabolic regulation, such as GLUL, GLUD1, and PYGL, although these interactions extend the functional repertoire of RIPK3 beyond classical necroptosis (Information section).\n\n5. Structure  \nRIPK3 comprises a conserved N-terminal kinase domain and a C-terminal region that contains a RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM). The kinase domain, essential for its catalytic activity, harbors key residues such as an ATP-positioning lysine (K51 in mouse), a catalytic aspartate in the HRD motif, and a Mg²⁺-coordinating aspartate in the DFG motif; these residues are critical for ATP binding and phosphate transfer (chiou2025thekinasedomain pages 4-7, cook2014ripk1andripk3induced pages 9-10). Structural studies, including high-resolution crystallography and amyloid structural analyses, reveal that RIPK3 can form amyloid-like fibrils via its RHIM domain, suggesting that higher-order oligomerization is central to the formation of functional necrosomes (wu2021theamyloidstructure pages 29-31, shlomovitz2017mechanismsofripk3‐induced pages 1-6). The RHIM domain mediates homotypic interactions with RIPK1 and other RHIM-containing proteins (TRIF, ZBP1), and these interactions are essential for necroptotic signal propagation. In addition, the kinase domain contains an activation loop that undergoes autophosphorylation, a conformational change that enables substrate access and efficient catalysis (chiou2025thekinasedomain pages 25-27, martens2020inhibitorstargetingripk1ripk3 pages 6-8).\n\n6. Regulation  \nRIPK3 activity is under tight regulatory control involving multiple post-translational modifications. Autophosphorylation is a key regulatory mechanism that facilitates activation of its kinase function as well as the subsequent phosphorylation of MLKL (murphy2015posttranslationalcontrolof pages 3-4, shi2018targetingreceptorinteractingserinethreonineprotein pages 63-68). Specific phosphorylation sites such as human Ser227 (mouse T231/S232) are essential for necroptotic signal transduction. In addition to phosphorylation, RIPK3 is regulated by ubiquitination events; for example, K48-linked ubiquitination by E3 ligases such as CHIP and PELI1 can target it for proteasomal degradation, thereby attenuating necroptosis (meng2021theregulationof pages 13-13). Deubiquitinating enzymes like A20 mediate the removal of ubiquitin chains to modulate complex assembly and sustain signaling (meng2021theregulationof pages 3-4). Proteolytic processing by caspase-8 provides an additional layer of regulation, as cleavage of RIPK3 prevents necroptosis and can shift the balance toward apoptosis (shlomovitz2017mechanismsofripk3‐induced pages 6-9, cook2014ripk1andripk3induced pages 12-13). Moreover, conformational regulation is evident as mutations in key residues, such as D161N or D143N, not only affect kinase catalytic activity but also alter conformational states that modulate interaction with binding partners like RIPK1 and caspase-8 (chiou2025thekinasedomain pages 25-27, newton2015ripk1andripk3 pages 1-2).\n\n7. Function  \nRIPK3 is a pivotal mediator of programmed cell death, operating predominantly through necroptosis—a caspase-independent form of cell death characterized by plasma membrane rupture and subsequent inflammation. In the necroptotic pathway, upon activation by death receptors (e.g., TNFR1) or pathogen recognition receptors (e.g., ZBP1, TRIF), RIPK3 associates with RIPK1 via RHIM-mediated interactions to form the necrosome. Within this complex, activated RIPK3 phosphorylates MLKL, which then oligomerizes and translocates to the plasma membrane to compromise membrane integrity (chiou2025thekinasedomain pages 1-4, zhou2024ripk3signalingand pages 2-3). In certain contexts such as viral infections (e.g., orthomyxoviruses, Zika virus), RIPK3 is capable of inducing necroptosis in the nucleus, leading to nuclear envelope disruption and release of genomic DNA into the cytosol (Information section).  \nBeyond necroptosis, RIPK3 plays a role in apoptosis regulation in a kinase-independent manner by acting as a scaffold to facilitate the formation of complexes involving RIPK1, FADD, and caspase-8 (liu2021ripk3signalingand pages 12-13, cook2014ripk1andripk3induced pages 9-10). Furthermore, cell death–independent functions include regulation of inflammatory gene expression via NF-κB and modulation of cellular metabolism. Interactions with metabolic enzymes such as GLUL, GLUD1, and PYGL support a role for RIPK3 in enhancing tricarboxylic acid cycle flux and oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. This metabolic reprogramming can contribute to antiviral responses by restricting viral replication, as seen in neuronal cells infected with Zika virus (Information section, liu2021ripk3signalingand pages 1-2). RIPK3 also has been implicated in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and in the subsequent maturation and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, thereby linking programmed necrosis to innate immune responses (zhou2024ripk3signalingand pages 5-6, shlomovitz2017mechanismsofripk3‐induced pages 21-23).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nRIPK3 is a target of significant therapeutic interest owing to its central role in necroptosis and inflammatory signaling. Several small molecule inhibitors that target the kinase domain of RIPK3 have been developed experimentally. For example, compounds such as GSK’872 and dabrafenib, originally developed as inhibitors in other kinase contexts, have been shown to inhibit RIPK3 kinase activity and reduce necroptosis in disease models, although challenges remain due to paradoxical induction of apoptosis in some instances (martens2020inhibitorstargetingripk1ripk3 pages 6-8, xia2020discoveryofa pages 9-10). RIPK3 has been implicated in a wide range of disease contexts, including inflammatory bowel disease, ischemia-reperfusion injury, toxic epidermal necrolysis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, kidney injury, and certain cancers. Mutations and dysregulation of RIPK3 have been reported to affect the balance between necroptosis and apoptosis, impacting tissue homeostasis and immune responses (moriwaki2017theinflammatorysignal pages 1-4, shlomovitz2017mechanismsofripk3‐induced pages 23-23). Moreover, the involvement of RIPK3 in metabolic regulation, through its interaction with enzymes such as ACOD1/IRG1 in neurons, provides an additional avenue by which it may influence viral replication without directly inducing cell death (Information section). As the complexity of RIPK3 regulation continues to be elucidated through studies investigating its scaffold functions, post-translational modifications, and interactions within multi-protein complexes, it remains a promising, albeit challenging, target for the development of novel anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective agents (martens2020inhibitorstargetingripk1ripk3 pages 6-8, shlomovitz2017mechanismsofripk3‐induced pages 9-13).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nRIPK4 is a member of the receptor‐interacting protein kinase (RIPK) family, a group of serine/threonine kinases that are evolutionarily conserved from invertebrates to vertebrates and classified within the human kinome based on common catalytic domain features (cuny2021ripkproteinkinase pages 1-2). Orthologs of RIPK4 can be found in mammals, birds, and amphibians, with a high degree of conservation in the kinase domain and the characteristic C-terminal ankyrin repeat region (fransen2011exploringtherole pages 137-139, lv2022comparativeandevolutionary pages 1-3). Within the kinome, RIPK4 is grouped with other RIP kinases and shares a closer evolutionary relationship with RIPK5, particularly because both possess ankyrin repeats in their C-termini, while diverging in domain organization from the RHIM-containing RIPK1 and RIPK3 or the CARD-containing RIPK2 (urwylerrosselet2023functionsofthe pages 12-13, lv2022comparativeandevolutionary pages 24-24).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nRIPK4 catalyzes the phosphorylation reaction in which ATP and a protein substrate containing L-serine or L-threonine residues are converted to ADP, a phosphorylated protein, and a proton, thereby transferring a phosphoryl group to its substrate (template similarity; buyseUnknownyearinvestigatingthepkcηripk4 pages 14-16).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of RIPK4, as a serine/threonine kinase, depends on the presence of divalent cations, with Mg²⁺ being the primary cofactor required for optimal ATP binding and phosphoryl transfer (template similarity; misehe2024designsynthesisanda pages 44-49).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nRIPK4 selectively phosphorylates serine/threonine residues on protein substrates, and its substrates include proteins involved in epidermal differentiation and cell adhesion such as plakophilin-1 (PKP1) (buyseUnknownyearinvestigatingthepkcηripk4 pages 14-16). Additionally, RIPK4 phosphorylates Dishevelled 2 (DVL2) in the context of canonical Wnt signaling, where its catalytic activity underlies β-catenin stabilization, although the precise consensus substrate motif has not been fully delineated (huang2013phosphorylationofdishevelled pages 1-1). Other substrates include transcription factors such as IRF6, whose phosphorylation is central to keratinocyte differentiation and epidermal barrier formation (cuny2021ripkproteinkinase pages 8-8). Experiments employing chimeric constructs have demonstrated that the intrinsic kinase domain of RIPK4, when juxtaposed with regulatory domains of other kinases, can exhibit dual-specificity autophosphorylation activity, further emphasizing the substrate-driven context of its specificity (chirieleison2016syntheticbiologyreveals pages 7-9).\n\n5. Structure  \nRIPK4 comprises an N-terminal kinase domain that retains all canonical motifs of serine/threonine kinases, including the ATP-binding P-loop, a catalytic loop containing the conserved HXD motif, and an activation loop whose phosphorylation likely modulates its catalytic activity (fransen2011exploringtherole pages 122-124, kalay2012mutationsinripk4 pages 3-4). The kinase domain is followed by an intermediate segment and a unique C-terminal region containing eleven ankyrin repeats; these repeats mediate protein–protein interactions essential for downstream signaling and may also exert autoinhibitory functions to modulate kinase activity (buyseUnknownyearinvestigatingthepkcηripk4 pages 14-16, fransen2011exploringtherole pages 122-124). Structural studies, including crystallographic data, have indicated that RIPK4’s kinase domain functions in a dimerization-dependent manner, where the formation of dimers is critical for its full catalytic activation, with structural elements such as the hydrophobic spine and the C-helix playing key roles in stabilizing the active conformation (cuny2021ripkproteinkinase pages 8-8, chirieleison2016syntheticbiologyreveals pages 9-11). Although explicit details of the activation loop conformation in RIPK4 are not provided, the high sequence conservation across RIP kinases supports the presence of these canonical structural features (lv2022comparativeandevolutionary pages 1-3).\n\n6. Regulation  \nRIPK4 is regulated by multiple post-translational mechanisms; phosphorylation events within its kinase domain contribute to its activation and may occur through autophosphorylation or via upstream kinases such as protein kinase C isoforms (PKCδ, PKCε, and PKCη) which bind and possibly phosphorylate RIPK4 (buyseUnknownyearinvestigatingthepkcηripk4 pages 14-16, urwylerrosselet2023functionsofthe pages 6-8). In addition, caspase-mediated cleavage of the intermediate domain has been observed, generating C-terminal fragments that negatively regulate NF-κB signaling, thereby modulating the balance between survival and apoptotic processes (fransen2011exploringtherole pages 122-124). Dimerization is another critical regulator, with the formation of kinase domain dimers being required for full activation, and the ankyrin repeats have been implicated in attenuating NF-κB activation, potentially by interfering with homo-dimerization (chirieleison2016syntheticbiologyreveals pages 6-7, cuny2021ripkproteinkinase pages 2-3).\n\n7. Function  \nRIPK4 plays a pivotal role in embryonic skin development and the maintenance of adult epidermal homeostasis by promoting keratinocyte differentiation and cell adhesion (buyseUnknownyearinvestigatingthepkcηripk4 pages 14-16). Its kinase activity is instrumental in phosphorylating substrates such as PKP1, thereby supporting the proper assembly of desmosomes and cell–cell adhesion (buyseUnknownyearinvestigatingthepkcηripk4 pages 14-16). RIPK4 also participates in NF-κB signaling by directly phosphorylating components of the IKK complex and is involved in activating Wnt/β-catenin cascades through DVL2 phosphorylation, events that are critical for both epidermal barrier formation and developmental processes (huang2013phosphorylationofdishevelled pages 1-1, xu2020insightintothe pages 1-2). Furthermore, its regulation by TP63 positions RIPK4 as an essential transcriptional target in skin morphogenesis and differentiation, while aberrations in its function have been associated with developmental syndromes such as popliteal pterygium syndrome and Bartsocas-Papas syndrome (kalay2012mutationsinripk4 pages 3-4, kalay2012mutationsinripk4 pages 6-7).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nBRAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib and dabrafenib have been shown to downregulate RIPK4 expression in melanoma cells, indicating an off-target pharmacological interaction, although these drugs do not appear to modulate the canonical BRAF/MEK/ERK pathway directly through RIPK4 (madej2023vemurafenibanddabrafenib pages 22-23). Despite the recognition of RIPK4’s roles in epidermal development and tumor suppression in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, specific small-molecule inhibitors targeting RIPK4 are not well characterized in the current literature (misehe2024designsynthesisanda pages 44-49). Known disease mutations in RIPK4 affecting its kinase domain and ankyrin repeats have been implicated in developmental disorders, including the autosomal-recessive popliteal pterygium syndrome, which underscores its importance in proper ectodermal development (kalay2012mutationsinripk4 pages 3-4, kalay2012mutationsinripk4 pages 6-7). Moreover, the dual-specificity potential observed in chimeric studies emphasizes the context-dependent regulation of its catalytic activity, and post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination and caspase-mediated cleavage further contribute to its diverse regulatory mechanisms (chirieleison2016syntheticbiologyreveals pages 6-7, misehe2024designsynthesisandb pages 132-135).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695).

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine-protein kinase JAK1 is a highly conserved non-receptor tyrosine kinase that belongs to the Janus kinase (JAK) family, which comprises four members: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2. This family is conserved across vertebrates and is present in numerous species ranging from mammals to birds and fish, reflecting an evolutionary lineage that can be traced back to a common ancestral kinase. JAK1 is grouped within the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase branch of the kinome, and its domain architecture—with an N‐terminal FERM domain, an SH2-like domain, a regulatory pseudokinase domain (JH2) and a catalytic kinase domain (JH1)—is a hallmark of the JAK family. Its evolutionary relationship with the other JAK family members is evidenced by the conservation of critical regulatory and catalytic sequences, as well as functional similarities in signal transduction through cytokine receptors (yamaoka2004thejanuskinases pages 1-2, rane2000januskinasescomponents pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nJAK1 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to tyrosine residues on substrate proteins. The chemical reaction can be summarized as follows: ATP + [protein] – (L-tyrosine) → ADP + [protein] – (L-tyrosine)-phosphate + H⁺. This reaction is central to the activation of downstream signaling proteins, including the phosphorylation of receptor subunits and STAT transcription factors (aliceavelazquez2011theuseof pages 2-3, oshea2009januskinasesin pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of JAK1 depends on the presence of divalent metal ions, most notably Mg²⁺. This cofactor is critical for the proper coordination of ATP within the active site of the kinase domain, thereby facilitating the phosphotransfer reaction (aliceavelazquez2011theuseof pages 2-3).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nJAK1 exhibits substrate specificity predominantly for tyrosine residues present in intracellular domains of cytokine receptors as well as on STAT proteins. In its action, JAK1 phosphorylates specific tyrosine sites on the interferon receptor IFNAR2 and directly on STAT proteins, thus generating docking sites that mediate subsequent signal propagation via the JAK-STAT pathway. The consensus substrate motif for JAK1-driven phosphorylation events is less well defined compared to some other tyrosine kinases; however, its substrate selection is determined by the spatial conformation of the receptor-associated sequence and the proximity to the kinase domain upon receptor engagement (oshea2009januskinasesin pages 1-2, babon2014themolecularregulation pages 1-3).\n\n5. Structure  \nThe three-dimensional structure of JAK1 is organized into distinct domains that facilitate its diverse functions. At the N-terminus, the FERM domain (comprising JH6-JH7) mediates binding to cytokine receptor intracellular domains, and the adjacent SH2-like domain (often corresponding to JH3-JH4) contributes to protein–protein interactions. Following these receptor-binding modules is the pseudokinase domain (JH2), which, although lacking full catalytic activity, plays a regulatory role by modulating the conformation and basal activity of the enzyme. The C-terminal kinase domain (JH1) is the catalytic unit that executes ATP-dependent phosphoryl transfer to target tyrosine residues. Structural studies, including high-resolution crystallography and advanced modeling approaches, have revealed key features of the kinase domain such as the classic bilobed structure, a conserved activation loop that undergoes phosphorylation-induced conformational change for activation, a well-defined catalytic cleft with the ATP-binding site, and elements such as the hydrophobic spine and C-helix that are crucial for maintaining the active conformation. Unique structural elements such as vertebrate-specific insertions within the kinase domain also provide additional regulatory interfaces that may be exploited for selective inhibitor design (yamaoka2004thejanuskinases pages 2-3, babon2014themolecularregulation pages 3-4, lupardus2014structureofthe pages 5-6).\n\n6. Regulation  \nJAK1 activity is subject to a multilayered regulatory network that ensures appropriate signal transduction in response to cytokine binding. Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, play a central role in regulating JAK1 function. Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on the activation loop within the JH1 domain is essential for full catalytic activation, while other phosphorylation events on the receptor–JAK complex contribute to the recruitment of downstream signaling molecules. The pseudokinase domain (JH2) exerts autoinhibitory control over the kinase domain; mutations in this region are known to disrupt this inhibition and result in constitutive activation of the kinase. Negative regulatory proteins such as the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling (SOCS) family bind to phosphorylated JAK1 or the receptor complex, thereby inhibiting kinase activity and promoting ubiquitin-dependent degradation. In addition, protein tyrosine phosphatases can dephosphorylate key activation loop residues, serving as an off-switch for JAK1-mediated signaling. Together, these mechanisms tightly control JAK1 activity to maintain the fidelity of cytokine-induced signal transduction (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 9-11, oshea2009januskinasesin pages 20-23, raivola2019characterizationofjak1 pages 13-15).\n\n7. Function  \nJAK1 functions as a critical mediator in the transduction of signals initiated by a wide array of cytokines. It is indispensable for the signaling pathways of type I interferons (IFN-α/β), type II interferon (IFN-γ), the interleukin (IL)-2 receptor, and the IL-10 receptor, among others. In response to interferon binding, JAK1, in association with other JAK family members, phosphorylates IFNAR2 to create docking sites for STAT proteins, which are then activated by further phosphorylation events. This cascade ultimately leads to the translocation of STAT dimers into the nucleus, where they regulate the transcription of genes involved in antiviral responses, immune modulation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. JAK1 is ubiquitously expressed and, owing to its central role in cytokine receptor signaling, is critical for the proper function of both innate and adaptive immune responses. The kinase also acts as a transactivator by regulating the activity of other JAK kinases in certain receptor complexes, thus ensuring robust and coordinated downstream signaling (aliceavelazquez2011theuseof pages 2-3, clark2014discoveryanddevelopment pages 3-5, raivola2019characterizationofjak1 pages 1-3).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral small molecule inhibitors have been developed that target the kinase domain of JAK1, as well as other members of the JAK family, and these inhibitors have been used clinically in the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Inhibitors such as tofacitinib, ruxolitinib, and others have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of modulating JAK1 activity by competitively binding to the ATP-binding pocket of the kinase domain. Dysregulation of JAK1, including activating mutations and aberrant phosphorylation events, has been associated with various pathological conditions such as immunodeficiencies, hematological malignancies, and inflammatory disorders. Activating mutations in the pseudokinase domain, analogous to those observed in other JAK family members, can lead to constitutive signaling independent of cytokine stimulation, thereby contributing to oncogenic transformation. Ongoing research aims to develop inhibitors that are selective for JAK1 to minimize off-target effects that occur with pan-JAK inhibitors and to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying its regulation and function (rashid2015inhibitionofjanus pages 1-4, gadina2019januskinasesto pages 1-2, seavey2012themanyfaces pages 1-2).\n\n9.

Mediates essential signaling events in both innate and adaptive immunity. In the cytoplasm, plays a pivotal role in signal transduction via its association with type I receptors such as growth hormone (GHR), prolactin (PRLR), leptin (LEPR), erythropoietin (EPOR), thrombopoietin receptor (MPL/TPOR); or type II receptors including IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, IFN-gamma and multiple interleukins (PubMed:15690087, PubMed:7615558, PubMed:9657743, PubMed:15899890). Following ligand-binding to cell surface receptors, phosphorylates specific tyrosine residues on the cytoplasmic tails of the receptor, creating docking sites for STATs proteins (PubMed:15690087, PubMed:9618263). Subsequently, phosphorylates the STATs proteins once they are recruited to the receptor. Phosphorylated STATs then form homodimer or heterodimers and translocate to the nucleus to activate gene transcription. For example, cell stimulation with erythropoietin (EPO) during erythropoiesis leads to JAK2 autophosphorylation, activation, and its association with erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) that becomes phosphorylated in its cytoplasmic domain (PubMed:9657743). Then, STAT5 (STAT5A or STAT5B) is recruited, phosphorylated and activated by JAK2. Once activated, dimerized STAT5 translocates into the nucleus and promotes the transcription of several essential genes involved in the modulation of erythropoiesis. Part of a signaling cascade that is activated by increased cellular retinol and that leads to the activation of STAT5 (STAT5A or STAT5B) (PubMed:21368206). In addition, JAK2 mediates angiotensin-2-induced ARHGEF1 phosphorylation (PubMed:20098430). Plays a role in cell cycle by phosphorylating CDKN1B (PubMed:21423214). Cooperates with TEC through reciprocal phosphorylation to mediate cytokine-driven activation of FOS transcription. In the nucleus, plays a key role in chromatin by specifically mediating phosphorylation of 'Tyr-41' of histone H3 (H3Y41ph), a specific tag that promotes exclusion of CBX5 (HP1 alpha) from chromatin (PubMed:19783980). Up-regulates the potassium voltage-gated channel activity of KCNA3 (PubMed:25644777)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny – JAK2 is a member of the Janus kinase family, which comprises four paralogous enzymes: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2. Orthologs of JAK2 have been identified throughout vertebrate species, and its overall domain‐structure is highly conserved across these species, indicating an ancient evolutionary origin of cytokine receptor signaling components (hubbard2018mechanisticinsightsinto pages 1-2, jatiani2010jakstatpathwaysin pages 1-2). Within the human kinome, JAK2 is assigned to a distinct group of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases that share the common architecture of a FERM domain, an SH2-like domain, a pseudokinase domain, and the active kinase domain. It is phylogenetically related to other JAK family members that evolved from a common ancestral kinase, with evolutionary studies further supporting its conservation from early eukaryotes to modern vertebrates (lindauer2001predictionofthe pages 1-2, jatiani2010jakstatpathwaysin pages 2-3).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed – The catalytic reaction mediated by JAK2 follows the typical phosphorylation mechanism of protein tyrosine kinases. In the presence of ATP, JAK2 transfers the γ-phosphate from ATP to specific tyrosine residues on substrate proteins such as cytokine receptors and STAT transcription factors, generating ADP and a phosphorylated tyrosine substrate. The generic reaction can be summarized as:  \nATP + [protein]-Tyr → ADP + [protein]-Tyr-phosphate + H⁺ (ungureanu2005posttranslationalmodificationsin pages 11-14, niranjan2014functionalcharacterizationof pages 14-19).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements – JAK2 requires divalent cations to facilitate its catalytic activity. The enzyme relies primarily on Mg²⁺ as a cofactor for proper ATP binding and transfer of the phosphate group to its substrates. In addition, certain biochemical assays and studies of the pseudokinase domain’s autophosphorylation have indicated that Mn²⁺ can strongly enhance catalytic activity in specific contexts (kotyla2021thromboembolicadversedrug pages 2-4, niranjan2014functionalcharacterizationof pages 123-123).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity – Substrate recognition by JAK2 is largely determined by its ability to interact with tyrosine residues present on the cytoplasmic domains of various cytokine receptors. JAK2 phosphorylates specific receptor tyrosines, thereby creating docking sites for downstream signaling proteins such as STAT family members. Once recruited, STAT proteins are themselves phosphorylated on specific tyrosine sites, which promotes their dimerization and nuclear translocation. Although no single consensus sequence has been universally defined, the substrate specificity is conferred by docking interactions with receptor motifs and by the unique structural context provided by each receptor’s cytoplasmic tail (hubbard2018mechanisticinsightsinto pages 1-2, jatiani2010jakstatpathwaysin pages 1-2, niranjan2014functionalcharacterizationof pages 10-14).\n\n5. Structure – JAK2 is organized into multiple distinct domains that orchestrate its enzymatic and regulatory functions. The N-terminal portion contains a FERM domain responsible for binding to cytokine receptors, which facilitates membrane localization. Immediately adjacent is an SH2-like (SH2L) domain that contributes to protein–protein interactions involved in signal transduction. The central region comprises the pseudokinase domain (JH2), which is structurally similar to classical kinases yet exhibits limited catalytic activity; this domain plays a pivotal role in autoinhibition by interacting with the active kinase domain (JH1). The C-terminal JH1 domain contains the canonical bilobed structure with an activation loop that requires phosphorylation (e.g., tyrosine 1007) to achieve full catalytic activity. Structural models and crystallographic studies have revealed that the JH2 domain, despite being termed a pseudokinase, binds ATP (albeit with lower affinity) and mediates autophosphorylation on key regulatory sites (Ser523 and Tyr570), which in turn modulate the activity of the JH1 domain (hubbard2018mechanisticinsightsinto pages 1-2, lindauer2001predictionofthe pages 3-3, niranjan2014functionalcharacterizationof pages 127-128). Additional structural determinants such as the hydrophobic spine and the C-helix in the kinase domain are critical for maintaining the active conformation, while the juxtaposition of the JH2 and JH1 domains provides a mechanism for intramolecular regulation (wilks2008thejakkinases pages 5-6, niranjan2014functionalcharacterizationof pages 137-141).\n\n6. Regulation – The activity of JAK2 is tightly controlled by multiple regulatory mechanisms that involve both inter- and intramolecular interactions. The pseudokinase domain (JH2) plays an essential role in maintaining low basal activity by inhibiting the kinase domain (JH1) under resting conditions. Autophosphorylation events occur on both domains; phosphorylation of key residues such as Y1007 within the JH1 activation loop is necessary for full activation, whereas autophosphorylation on Ser523 and Tyr570 within the JH2 domain serves a negative regulatory function, reinforcing the autoinhibitory conformation (hubbard2018mechanisticinsightsinto pages 3-5, niranjan2014functionalcharacterizationof pages 123-123, niranjan2014functionalcharacterizationof pages 126-127). Mutations in the JH2 domain, most notably the V617F substitution, disrupt these regulatory interactions by abrogating the inhibitory effects, resulting in constitutive kinase activation and unregulated downstream signaling (hubbard2018mechanisticinsightsinto pages 1-2, jatiani2010jakstatpathwaysin pages 8-9, niranjan2014functionalcharacterizationof pages 115-117). Additionally, binding of JAK2 to receptor cytoplasmic tails through the FERM domain and the involvement of the SH2-like domain further contribute to its regulated activation in response to cytokine stimulation (wilks2008thejakkinases pages 6-8, niranjan2014functionalcharacterizationof pages 114-119).\n\n7. Function – JAK2 functions as a critical non-receptor tyrosine kinase in the transmission of signals from a diverse array of cell-surface receptors. In the cytoplasm, JAK2 associates with type I and type II cytokine receptors—including those for growth hormone, prolactin, leptin, erythropoietin, and thrombopoietin—and mediates phosphorylation of receptor tyrosine residues upon ligand activation. This creates binding sites for STAT transcription factors, which are subsequently phosphorylated by JAK2. Phosphorylated STATs dimerize and translocate into the nucleus, where they drive gene transcription programs essential for processes such as hematopoiesis, immune regulation, cell growth, and differentiation (hubbard2018mechanisticinsightsinto pages 1-2, jatiani2010jakstatpathwaysin pages 1-2, niranjan2014functionalcharacterizationof pages 10-14). In addition to its canonical signaling role, JAK2 also functions in the nucleus where it phosphorylates histone H3 on tyrosine 41, thereby influencing chromatin organization and gene expression. Other cellular processes regulated by JAK2 include cell cycle progression through phosphorylation of targets like CDKN1B, modulation of ion channel activity via up-regulation of potassium channels such as KCNA3, and mechanisms of reciprocal phosphorylation with other kinases such as TEC, which together impact the transcription of immediate early genes like FOS (hubbard2018mechanisticinsightsinto pages 5-6, niranjan2014functionalcharacterizationof pages 141-144).\n\n8. Other Comments – JAK2 is of particular clinical significance due to its implication in myeloproliferative neoplasms and other hematologic disorders. The activating V617F mutation, located in the pseudokinase domain, is found in over 90% of polycythemia vera cases and in approximately 50% of cases of essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis. This mutation disrupts the normal autoinhibitory function of the JH2 domain and leads to constitutive activation of the kinase, making it a prime target for therapeutic inhibition. Several small-molecule inhibitors targeting the ATP-binding site of the JH1 domain have been developed, including ruxolitinib and TG101348, among others, and are in various phases of clinical evaluation for their efficacy in modulating aberrant JAK2 signaling (jatiani2010jakstatpathwaysin pages 9-11, kotyla2021thromboembolicadversedrug pages 2-4, niranjan2014functionalcharacterizationof pages 117-119). In addition to these inhibitors, ongoing studies are aimed at developing agents that can selectively target mutant forms of JAK2 to minimize adverse effects on normal hematopoiesis (wilks2008thejakkinases pages 6-8, niranjan2014functionalcharacterizationof pages 152-156).\n\n9.

Mediates essential signaling events in both innate and adaptive immunity and plays a crucial role in hematopoiesis during T-cells development. In the cytoplasm, plays a pivotal role in signal transduction via its association with type I receptors sharing the common subunit gamma such as IL2R, IL4R, IL7R, IL9R, IL15R and IL21R. Following ligand binding to cell surface receptors, phosphorylates specific tyrosine residues on the cytoplasmic tails of the receptor, creating docking sites for STATs proteins. Subsequently, phosphorylates the STATs proteins once they are recruited to the receptor. Phosphorylated STATs then form homodimer or heterodimers and translocate to the nucleus to activate gene transcription. For example, upon IL2R activation by IL2, JAK1 and JAK3 molecules bind to IL2R beta (IL2RB) and gamma chain (IL2RG) subunits inducing the tyrosine phosphorylation of both receptor subunits on their cytoplasmic domain. Then, STAT5A and STAT5B are recruited, phosphorylated and activated by JAK1 and JAK3. Once activated, dimerized STAT5 translocates to the nucleus and promotes the transcription of specific target genes in a cytokine-specific fashion**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase JAK3 is one of four members of the Janus kinase family that, according to seminal kinome surveys, evolved from a common ancestor in the metazoan lineage (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 1-3, wilks2008thejakkinases pages 1-1). JAK3 is grouped with JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2 and is classified as a non‐receptor tyrosine kinase. Its expression is largely limited to hematopoietic cells, particularly lymphoid lineages, which distinguishes it from the ubiquitously expressed JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2. Homologs of JAK3 can be identified in all mammalian species, and the evolutionary relationships among the JAKs indicate divergence after gene duplication events early in vertebrate evolution (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 3-4, ungureanu2005posttranslationalmodificationsin pages 11-14).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nJAK3 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to specific tyrosine residues on substrate proteins. In its basic reaction, ATP and a protein substrate containing a tyrosine residue are converted to ADP and a phosphorylated protein, thereby converting the tyrosine residue into phosphotyrosine. The reaction can be summarized as:  \n  ATP + [protein]-Tyr → ADP + [protein]-Tyr-phosphate + H⁺  \nThis reaction is critical in mediating signaling events downstream of cytokine receptors (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 1-3).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of JAK3, like that of many kinases, is dependent on divalent metal ions, most commonly magnesium (Mg²⁺). The Mg²⁺ ion coordinates with ATP in the active site, thereby facilitating the phosphotransfer reaction (alexander2015theconciseguide pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nJAK3 shows substrate specificity in the context of cytokine receptor signaling. It phosphorylates specific tyrosine residues on the cytoplasmic tails of receptors that share the common gamma chain (γc) and on downstream signaling effectors such as the STAT proteins. In the case of interleukin-2 receptor (IL2R) signaling, for example, JAK3 works in tandem with JAK1 by phosphorylating tyrosine residues on IL2Rβ and IL2RG, thereby creating docking sites for STAT5A and STAT5B. Although an explicit consensus substrate motif for JAK3 is not provided in the available literature, its substrate specificity is defined by the receptor complex context and the presence of motifs that promote STAT recruitment (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 14-15, ungureanu2005posttranslationalmodificationsin pages 11-14).\n\n5. Structure  \nJAK3 is organized into several conserved domains that collectively define its function and regulation. Its N-terminal region contains the FERM domain, which is essential for binding to the membrane-proximal regions of cytokine receptors such as IL2R, IL4R, IL7R, IL9R, IL15R, and IL21R (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 4-6, ungureanu2005posttranslationalmodificationsin pages 11-14). Adjacent to the FERM domain is an SH2-like domain, which, although not a classical phosphotyrosine-binding SH2 domain, contributes to maintaining the structural integrity and receptor association of the kinase.  \nFollowing the receptor-binding modules is a pseudokinase domain (often referred to as JH2). Despite lacking full catalytic activity due to alterations in conserved motifs (for example, substitutions in the β3 strand lysine or the HxD motif), the pseudokinase domain plays a critical regulatory role by modulating the activity of the adjacent catalytic domain. Structural studies indicate that this domain not only participates in autoinhibition via intramolecular interactions (in cis) or possibly trans interactions among receptor-bound complexes but also binds nucleotides that serve as a molecular switch (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 4-6, wilks2008thejakkinases pages 5-6, bailey2014biochemicalanalysisof pages 29-33).  \nThe C-terminal region comprises the active kinase domain (JH1). This domain has the classical protein tyrosine kinase bi-lobed structure, with the small N-terminal lobe and a larger C-terminal lobe forming the ATP-binding pocket. Key catalytic features include a well-defined activation loop whose phosphorylation is required for full catalytic activity, a hydrophobic spine, and a C-helix that participates in the reorganization of the active site during conformational changes. Although high-resolution structures specific for full-length JAK3 are not yet available, comparisons with structural data from other JAK family members (such as TYK2 and JAK2) provide a robust framework for modelling JAK3’s architecture (wilks2008thejakkinases pages 4-5, babon2014themolecularregulation pages 7-9, loris2007exploringstructureand pages 49-52).\n\n6. Regulation  \nJAK3 is regulated at multiple levels that ensure proper signal fidelity upon cytokine stimulation. Receptor engagement by cytokines induces conformational changes that facilitate the juxtaposition of receptor-bound JAK molecules, thereby promoting transphosphorylation of key tyrosine residues in the activation loop (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 1-3, babon2014themolecularregulation pages 28-29). In addition to phosphorylation, regulatory mechanisms include:  \n\n• Autoinhibition mediated by the pseudokinase (JH2) domain. The JH2 domain is instrumental in maintaining low basal activity by either engaging the active kinase domain in cis or through trans inhibitory interactions between JAK molecules within receptor complexes (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 6-7, babon2014themolecularregulation pages 7-9).  \n\n• Negative feedback by suppressor proteins such as the SOCS family. SOCS proteins, particularly SOCS1 and SOCS3, can bind to phosphorylated tyrosine residues on JAKs or associated receptors, thereby blocking further kinase activity and promoting ubiquitin-mediated degradation of signaling components (ungureanu2005posttranslationalmodificationsin pages 14-16, piessevaux2008socsproteinsand pages 18-22).  \n\n• Dephosphorylation by protein tyrosine phosphatases, including CD45, TCPTP, and others. These phosphatases remove activating phosphates from the JAK activation loop and other regulatory sites, contributing to signal termination and ensuring that JAK3 is not constitutively active (ungureanu2005posttranslationalmodificationsin pages 9-11, safhi2008primingofstat1 pages 14-21).  \n\nTogether, these regulatory mechanisms ensure that JAK3 activity is tightly coupled to extracellular cytokine signals, preventing aberrant activation that could lead to pathological states (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 14-15, ungureanu2005posttranslationalmodificationsin pages 16-18).\n\n7. Function  \nJAK3 functions as a central mediator in cytokine receptor signaling pathways that control immune cell development, differentiation, and function. Its activity is indispensable in the signaling cascades initiated by cytokines that utilize the common gamma chain (γc), including IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21 (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 14-15, ungureanu2005posttranslationalmodificationsin pages 11-14). Upon cytokine binding to the respective receptor, JAK3 partners with JAK1 bound to other subunits (for example, IL2RB and IL2RG in the IL2 receptor complex) to phosphorylate receptor cytoplasmic tails, creating phosphotyrosine docking sites for STAT proteins. Subsequent phosphorylation of STAT5A and STAT5B leads to their dimerization and nuclear translocation where they activate transcription of cytokine-responsive genes (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 1-3, mitra2010identificationofa pages 15-23).  \nThe expression of JAK3 is largely confined to cells within immune tissues such as T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, and myeloid cells. Loss-of-function mutations in JAK3 result in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), underscoring its non-redundant function in lymphoid development and adaptive immunity (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 9-11, ungureanu2005posttranslationalmodificationsin pages 63-65). Furthermore, activating mutations—reported in domains such as the FERM and pseudokinase regions—have been linked to hematological malignancies like acute megakaryocytic leukemia, highlighting the clinical importance of precise JAK3 regulation (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 4-6, wilks2008thejakkinases pages 9-10).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nJAK3 is a recognized therapeutic target, particularly in the context of immune dysregulation and autoimmune diseases. Small molecule inhibitors, including agents such as tofacitinib (CP690,550), have been developed to target JAK3 (often in combination with inhibition of JAK1) with the aim of modulating cytokine signaling in inflammatory and transplant settings (wilks2008thejakkinases pages 6-8, babon2014themolecularregulation pages 26-28). Inhibitory compounds generally target the conserved ATP-binding site within the kinase domain; however, achieving absolute specificity for JAK3 remains challenging due to the high structural homology with other JAK family members (alexander2015theconciseguide pages 10-13, wilks2008thejakkinases pages 9-9).  \nDisease associations with JAK3 include severe combined immunodeficiency (resulting from loss-of-function mutations) as well as various leukemias where activating mutations may lead to uncontrolled proliferation of hematopoietic cells (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 11-13, ungureanu2005posttranslationalmodificationsin pages 65-68). Clinical development of JAK inhibitors continues as therapeutic strategies are refined to maximize efficacy in immune modulation while minimizing adverse effects commonly associated with broad immunosuppression (wilks2008thejakkinases pages 8-9).\n\n9.

Plays both structural and catalytic roles in numerous interleukins and interferons (IFN-alpha/beta) signaling (PubMed:10542297). Associates with heterodimeric cytokine receptor complexes and activates STAT family members including STAT1, STAT3, STAT4 or STAT6 (PubMed:10542297, PubMed:7638186). The heterodimeric cytokine receptor complexes are composed of (1) a TYK2-associated receptor chain (IFNAR1, IL12RB1, IL10RB or IL13RA1), and (2) a second receptor chain associated either with JAK1 or JAK2 (PubMed:10542297, PubMed:25762719, PubMed:7526154, PubMed:7813427). In response to cytokine-binding to receptors, phosphorylates and activates receptors (IFNAR1, IL12RB1, IL10RB or IL13RA1), creating docking sites for STAT members (PubMed:7526154, PubMed:7657660).

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nNon‐receptor tyrosine‐protein kinase TYK2 is a member of the Janus kinase (JAK) family, which comprises four members—JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2—that are evolutionarily conserved among vertebrates (argiriadi2012enablingstructurebaseddrug pages 10-11, azevedo2019nonreceptortyrosinekinases pages 1-3). Orthologs of TYK2 have been identified in a wide range of mammals, indicating that its essential role in cytokine receptor signaling arose early in metazoan evolution and has been maintained throughout vertebrate diversification (argiriadi2012enablingstructurebaseddrug pages 10-11, azevedo2019nonreceptortyrosinekinases pages 1-3). Within the human kinome, TYK2 is classified under the non‐receptor tyrosine kinase branch and, more specifically, among the JAK family members that share a conserved modular domain organization essential for mediating responses to cytokines and interferons (argiriadi2012enablingstructurebaseddrug pages 10-11, azevedo2019nonreceptortyrosinekinases pages 1-3).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nTYK2 catalyzes the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues by transferring the γ-phosphate from ATP to specific tyrosine residues on protein substrates (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 1-3). The overall chemical reaction can be represented by the generalized equation:  \n  ATP + [protein]-L-tyrosine = ADP + [protein]-L-tyrosine-phosphate + H⁺,  \nwhich serves as the fundamental biochemical process underlying the activation of downstream signaling molecules in response to cytokine stimulation (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 1-3).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of TYK2 requires the presence of divalent metal ion cofactors, with magnesium ions (Mg²⁺) being essential to properly coordinate ATP within the enzyme’s active site (min2015structuralandfunctional pages 1-2). The requirement for Mg²⁺ is consistent with the biochemical properties of most protein kinases, where the metal ion facilitates the correct positioning and stabilization of ATP to enable efficient phosphoryl transfer (min2015structuralandfunctional pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nTYK2 phosphorylates tyrosine residues that are principally located in the intracellular domains of cytokine receptor chains as well as on downstream signaling proteins such as STAT transcription factors (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 1-3). Although a well‐defined consensus sequence analogous to the RxRxxp[ST] motif seen in serine/threonine kinases has not been fully established for TYK2, its substrates tend to feature specific tyrosine residues that, when phosphorylated, function as binding sites for downstream signaling effectors including STAT1, STAT3, STAT4, and STAT6 (YaronBarir2024TheIntrinsicSubstrate pages 1-2). Peptide-array approaches and intrinsic substrate specificity studies indicate that the preference for tyrosine residues is a key determinant in recruiting the correct signaling partners during cytokine responses (YaronBarir2024TheIntrinsicSubstrate pages 1-2).\n\n5. Structure  \nTYK2 is organized into a series of distinct domains that each contribute to its function in cytokine signaling. At the N-terminus, TYK2 contains a FERM (band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin) domain, which is critical for binding to the cytoplasmic tails of cytokine receptors such as IFNAR1, IL12RB1, IL10RB, and IL13RA1 (argiriadi2012enablingstructurebaseddrug pages 10-11, karjalainen2016interactionsofjak2 pages 8-11). Adjacent to the FERM domain is an SH2-like domain; although it may not bind phosphotyrosine in the canonical fashion, it assists in stabilizing receptor interactions and ensuring proper spatial orientation within the signaling complex (argiriadi2012enablingstructurebaseddrug pages 10-11, karjalainen2016interactionsofjak2 pages 8-11).  \nFollowing the receptor-binding modules, TYK2 harbors a pseudokinase domain (often referred to as JH2) that, despite retaining an overall kinase fold and the capacity to bind ATP, lacks the full complement of catalytic residues typically required for phosphoryl transfer. This domain plays an essential regulatory role by modulating the activity of the adjacent catalytic tyrosine kinase domain (JH1) and by participating in intramolecular interactions that maintain TYK2 in an autoinhibited state under basal conditions (min2015structuralandfunctional pages 2-3, mingione2023allostericregulationand pages 1-3).  \nAt its C-terminus, the JH1 domain is responsible for the actual phosphotransfer reaction. This catalytic domain adopts a classical bilobal structure with a small N-terminal lobe that includes the glycine-rich loop involved in ATP binding and a conserved lysine residue critical for proper ATP orientation, and a larger C-terminal lobe that houses the activation loop (A-loop) along with key motifs such as the HRD and DFG sequences, which are integral to catalytic efficiency and stabilization of the enzyme’s active conformation (min2015structuralandfunctional pages 2-3, mingione2023allostericregulationand pages 1-3). Key structural features, including hydrophobic spines and the C-helix, facilitate the conformational changes associated with activation and allosteric regulation, and these elements are vital for the transmission of regulatory signals from the pseudokinase to the kinase domain (mingione2023allostericregulationand pages 7-9).\n\n6. Regulation  \nTYK2 is subject to multiple layers of regulation that ensure its activity is tightly controlled in response to extracellular signals. Cytokine binding to the receptor complex triggers receptor dimerization, which in turn promotes trans-phosphorylation of tyrosine residues within the activation loop of the catalytic kinase domain, thereby stabilizing the active conformation needed for effective substrate phosphorylation (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 1-3, min2015structuralandfunctional pages 2-3).  \nThe pseudokinase domain exerts an autoinhibitory effect under resting conditions by engaging in intramolecular interactions that constrain the kinase domain’s activity; however, upon cytokine-induced receptor engagement and subsequent ATP binding to the pseudokinase domain, conformational changes are induced that relieve this autoinhibition and promote catalytic activation (li2017insightsontype pages 22-26, li2017insightsontypea pages 22-26). Additionally, TYK2 has been shown to negatively regulate STAT3 signaling by phosphorylating a specific tyrosine residue that is distinct from the residues involved in the primary activation of STAT proteins, thereby providing an additional level of control over downstream transcriptional responses (gerstenberger2020demonstrationofin pages 8-9, he2019selectivetyk2inhibitors pages 11-13).\n\n7. Function  \nTYK2 plays a critical role as a mediator of cytokine and interferon signaling by associating with heterodimeric cytokine receptor complexes. In these complexes, one receptor chain (for example, IFNAR1, IL12RB1, IL10RB, or IL13RA1) is constitutively bound to TYK2, while a second receptor chain is associated with another JAK family member such as JAK1 or JAK2. Ligand binding to these receptor complexes initiates TYK2-dependent phosphorylation of the receptor chains, thereby creating docking sites for STAT transcription factors (argiriadi2012enablingstructurebaseddrug pages 10-11, azevedo2019nonreceptortyrosinekinases pages 1-3).  \nFollowing recruitment, STAT proteins (including STAT1, STAT3, STAT4, and STAT6) are phosphorylated by TYK2 (or the partnering JAK) and subsequently dimerize and translocate to the nucleus, where they modulate gene expression programs involved in cell growth, development, differentiation, and both innate and adaptive immunity (argiriadi2012enablingstructurebaseddrug pages 10-11, babon2014themolecularregulation pages 1-3). Moreover, TYK2 exerts a dual regulatory function by not only activating STAT family members but also by selectively attenuating STAT3 signaling through phosphorylation of a unique tyrosine residue distinct from the canonical activation sites (karjalainen2016interactionsofjak2 pages 8-11, babon2014themolecularregulation pages 1-3). TYK2 is expressed widely in immune cell populations including lymphocytes and myeloid cells, where its activity is central to the orchestration of antiviral responses and inflammation (min2015structuralandfunctional pages 2-3, mingione2023allostericregulationand pages 1-3).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nDue to its central role in cytokine and interferon signaling, TYK2 has become an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. Several small molecule inhibitors have been developed that target TYK2, with some compounds binding selectively to its pseudokinase domain to stabilize the autoinhibited conformation and thus reduce kinase activity (he2019selectivetyk2inhibitors pages 11-13, mingione2023allostericregulationand pages 7-9). Genetic polymorphisms and mutations within the TYK2 gene are associated with altered susceptibility to various autoimmune diseases, which may result from impaired receptor phosphorylation or dysregulated STAT activation due to perturbations in the pseudokinase‐kinase domain interface (li2017insightsontypeb pages 22-26, majeski2020theroleof pages 35-39). In addition, aberrant activation of TYK2 has been implicated in certain hematological malignancies where constitutive kinase activation drives pathological cell survival and proliferation (min2015structuralandfunctional pages 2-3, li2017insightsontypea pages 22-26). These clinical associations underscore the importance of ongoing drug discovery efforts aimed at modulating TYK2 activity while minimizing off-target effects on other JAK family members (he2019selectivetyk2inhibitors pages 11-13, majeski2020theroleof pages 39-43).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTRPM6 is a member of the melastatin-related transient receptor potential (TRPM) subfamily of ion channels. Orthologs of TRPM6 are found in vertebrates, and its evolutionary history appears to be tightly linked with that of TRPM7, with which it shares approximately 50% amino acid sequence homology (chubanov2004disruptionoftrpm6trpm7 pages 2-3). Within the broader kinome, TRPM6 is assigned to the atypical α‐kinase family, a group that diverges from conventional serine/threonine kinases and is represented in diverse eukaryotes (schmitz2005thechannelkinases pages 1-2). The conservation of key residues in its kinase and channel domains across mammals, birds, and fish underscores its fundamental role in magnesium homeostasis, and the evolutionary appearance of the TRPM6 gene predates the diversification of vertebrates (chubanov2005emergingrolesof pages 2-3, stadlbauer2023theroleof pages 22-26).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nTRPM6 catalyzes the phosphorylation reaction typical of serine/threonine protein kinases. The reaction can be represented as:  \nATP + [protein] – (L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein] – (L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (cao2008rack1inhibitstrpm6 pages 4-5, schmitz2005thechannelkinases pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of TRPM6 is dependent on divalent metal ions, with Mg²⁺ serving as the required cofactor for ATP binding and catalytic activity. This is in line with its classification in the atypical α‐kinase family where optimal activity is achieved in the presence of Mg²⁺ (ryazanova2004characterizationofthe pages 6-7, schmitz2005thechannelkinases pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nThe intrinsic kinase domain of TRPM6 phosphorylates serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. Although a detailed consensus substrate motif specific to TRPM6 is less well‐defined compared to conventional serine/threonine kinases, studies indicate that TRPM6 (and its counterpart TRPM7) can phosphorylate proteins such as myosin heavy chain isoforms and annexin A1. Moreover, autophosphorylation events have been reported on multiple threonine and serine residues within its kinase domain (cao2008rack1inhibitstrpm6 pages 4-5, schmitz2005thechannelkinases pages 4-5). Data from comprehensive substrate specificity atlases for the human serine/threonine kinome are not yet available for TRPM6 specifically; however, its structural kinship with TRPM7 suggests that a preference for substrates with alpha-helical regions may be operative (runnels2011trpm6andtrpm7 pages 2-3).\n\n5. Structure  \nTRPM6 is a bifunctional protein comprising two major modules: an ion channel and an intrinsic protein kinase domain. The channel portion includes six transmembrane helices (S1–S6) with a pore-forming loop between S5 and S6 that harbors the selectivity filter, with conserved residues such as those in the sequence motif 1028GEIDVC1033 being critical for Mg²⁺ permeation (topala2007moleculardeterminantsof pages 154-156, chubanov2014trpm6 pages 9-11). The N-terminal region may contain ankyrin-like repeats that contribute to channel assembly and stability (chubanov2014trpm6 pages 1-3). C-terminal to the channel module, TRPM6 contains an atypical α‐kinase domain that is structurally distinct from conventional kinases. This kinase domain is organized into two lobes that create the nucleotide-binding cleft, and it harbors critical residues, such as Thr1851—a major autophosphorylation site that modulates channel regulation—and other essential amino acids required for catalytic function (cao2008rack1inhibitstrpm6 pages 4-5, ferioli2017trpm6andtrpm7 pages 1-2). In addition, regions adjacent to the kinase domain, including a serine/threonine rich segment and a coiled-coil domain, are thought to facilitate oligomerization and heteromeric interactions with TRPM7, a necessary process for efficient membrane expression (chubanov2004disruptionoftrpm6trpm7 pages 4-6, stadlbauer2023theroleof pages 22-26).\n\n6. Regulation  \nMultiple regulatory mechanisms modulate TRPM6 activity. Autophosphorylation is a key regulatory event: for instance, phosphorylation of Thr1851 within the kinase domain modulates the inhibitory effect of the regulatory protein RACK1 on TRPM6 channel currents (cao2008rack1inhibitstrpm6 pages 4-5). RACK1 itself binds near the kinase domain and acts as an inhibitor; overexpression of RACK1 suppresses channel activity while siRNA-mediated knockdown enhances it (cao2008rack1inhibitstrpm6 pages 4-5). In addition, TRPM6 activity is tightly controlled by intracellular Mg²⁺ levels and Mg·ATP, which serve as negative regulators of its channel function (hoenderop2009epithelialmg2+ pages 1-3, runnels2011trpm6andtrpm7 pages 1-2). Heteromerization with TRPM7 is another key aspect of regulation; TRPM6 alone shows minimal surface expression, and co-assembly with TRPM7 is required for proper trafficking and functional channel formation (chubanov2004disruptionoftrpm6trpm7 pages 2-3, chubanov2014trpm6 pages 11-14). In some experimental models, activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by phorbol esters such as PMA disrupts the interaction between RACK1 and TRPM6, thereby relieving channel inhibition (cao2008rack1inhibitstrpm6 pages 4-5).\n\n7. Function  \nTRPM6 plays a crucial role in the regulation of magnesium homeostasis by mediating Mg²⁺ influx across epithelial cells. It is predominantly expressed in the kidney—especially within the distal convoluted tubule (DCT)—and the intestine, tissues vital for active Mg²⁺ absorption (hoenderop2009epithelialmg2+ pages 1-3, chubanov2014trpm6 pages 16-18). Through its ion channel function, TRPM6 permits the entry of Mg²⁺ into the cell, and its intrinsic kinase activity may facilitate downstream signaling pathways by phosphorylating target substrates involved in cytoskeletal dynamics and cell growth (cao2008rack1inhibitstrpm6 pages 4-5, li2007moleculardeterminantsof pages 1-1). In addition, the ability of TRPM6 to form heteromeric channels with TRPM7 is essential for its surface expression and function, and mutations in TRPM6 that impair its channel function or disrupt its assembly with TRPM7 result in hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia (HSH), a severe electrolyte imbalance manifesting during infancy with seizures and muscle spasms (chubanov2007hypomagnesemiawithsecondary pages 1-1, topala2007moleculardeterminantsof pages 154-156). Expression studies have shown that disruption of TRPM6 function leads to defective Mg²⁺ reabsorption in the kidney and impaired intestinal magnesium uptake, underscoring its indispensable role in systemic magnesium balance (chubanov2016epithelialmagnesiumtransport pages 32-32, yogi2011transientreceptorpotential pages 2-4).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral modulatory agents and genetic variants have been identified that influence TRPM6 activity. For example, RACK1 acts as an endogenous inhibitor of TRPM6, and its effect can be counteracted by PKC-mediated signaling (cao2008rack1inhibitstrpm6 pages 4-5). Moreover, pharmacological agents such as 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) have been shown in some studies to modulate TRPM6 or related TRPM channel activity, although a specific inhibitor selective for TRPM6 alone is not yet well established (harteneck2005functionandpharmacology pages 3-5, li2006functionalcharacterizationof pages 1-2). Mutations in TRPM6, including missense mutations in the pore-forming region (for example, substitutions affecting residues critical for ion selectivity), are causally linked to hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia (HSH); these mutations lead to either loss of channel function or defective heteromerization with TRPM7 (chubanov2007hypomagnesemiawithsecondary pages 1-2, topala2007moleculardeterminantsof pages 154-156). In addition, TRPM6 has been implicated in additional roles in epithelial Mg²⁺ transport beyond the intestine and kidney, with emerging evidence suggesting broader expression in tissues such as the lung, testis, and immune cells (chubanov2014trpm6 pages 16-18, yogi2011transientreceptorpotential pages 2-4). At present, no highly selective clinical inhibitors have been approved for therapeutic modulation of TRPM6, although experimental compounds targeting its kinase or channel domains continue to be evaluated (brandao2014trpm6kinaseactivity pages 1-2).\n\n9.

The channel is highly permeable to divalent cations, specifically calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+) and zinc (Zn2+) and mediates their influx (PubMed:11385574, PubMed:12887921, PubMed:15485879, PubMed:24316671, PubMed:35561741, PubMed:36027648). Controls a wide range of biological processes such as Ca2(+), Mg(2+) and Zn(2+) homeostasis, vesicular Zn(2+) release channel and intracellular Ca(2+) signaling, embryonic development, immune responses, cell motility, proliferation and differentiation (By similarity). The C-terminal alpha-kinase domain autophosphorylates cytoplasmic residues of TRPM7 (PubMed:18365021). In vivo, TRPM7 phosphorylates SMAD2, suggesting that TRPM7 kinase may play a role in activating SMAD signaling pathways. In vitro, TRPM7 kinase phosphorylates ANXA1 (annexin A1), myosin II isoforms and a variety of proteins with diverse cellular functions (PubMed:15485879, PubMed:18394644)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTRPM7 is a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) melastatin subfamily that arose early during vertebrate evolution and is conserved among mammals, birds, and fish while being absent in representatives such as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans (chubanov2005emergingrolesof pages 2-3). TRPM7 shares a close evolutionary relationship with TRPM6, and both proteins appear as a distinct ‘channel-kinase’ branch within the TRPM family, suggesting that their dual functionality emerged concomitantly with the evolution of vertebrates (chubanov2005emergingrolesof pages 2-3, jolly2025thepactnetwork pages 6-7). The protein belongs to a conserved set of channel proteins that integrate ion transport with enzymatic activity, and its orthologs have been identified in a broad range of vertebrate species, indicative of its essential role in ion homeostasis and cellular signaling (runnels2011trpm6andtrpm7 pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nThe kinase domain of TRPM7 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to a serine or threonine residue on a substrate protein, following the classical phosphorylation reaction: ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (fleig2014trpm7 pages 9-12).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nFor both its ion channel and kinase catalytic functions, TRPM7 depends on divalent cations, most notably magnesium (Mg²⁺), which serves as an essential cofactor not only for stabilizing the nucleotide–substrate complex during phosphotransfer reactions but also for its role in ion permeation through the channel domain (chubanov2012theemergingrole pages 134-137, runnels2011trpm6andtrpm7 pages 4-5). Additionally, Mg·ATP functions as a regulatory ligand that, in conjunction with free Mg²⁺, modulates the kinase activity and suppresses the channel’s constitutive currents (chubanov2012theemergingrole pages 141-143).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nTRPM7 phosphorylates serine and threonine residues on a variety of substrate proteins. In vivo, one of its notable substrates is SMAD2, implying a role in modulating SMAD signaling pathways, whereas in vitro it phosphorylates proteins such as annexin A1 and several myosin II isoforms (chubanov2012theemergingrole pages 141-143, yee2014cellularanddevelopmental pages 6-8). Although a precise consensus motif has not been definitively established, the kinase domain exhibits a general preference for serine/threonine residues in target proteins that often reside within alpha-helical segments, and the phosphorylation events occur in the context of a regulatory autophosphorylation region that enhances substrate recognition (runnels2011trpm6andtrpm7 pages 3-4).\n\n5. Structure  \nTRPM7 is a bifunctional “chanzyme” with a complex domain organization that supports both its ion channel and kinase functions. The N-terminal region contains melastatin homology domains whose precise function remains to be fully determined but may mediate interactions with cytosolic proteins (fleig2014trpm7 pages 1-3). The central portion is composed of six transmembrane helices (S1–S6) with a pore-forming loop located between S5 and S6 that is responsible for the ion selectivity; key residues in this pore, such as the conserved glutamate (E1047), are critical for divalent cation permeation and magnesium‐mediated pore block (fleig2014trpm7 pages 3-6, runnels2011trpm6andtrpm7 pages 3-4). Downstream of the transmembrane segments, a conserved TRP domain and a coiled-coil motif facilitate tetrameric assembly and contribute to channel gating (chubanov2014naturalandsynthetic pages 1-3, gao2022palmitoylationandregulation pages 49-53). The C-terminal portion is dominated by an atypical α-type serine/threonine kinase domain that undergoes autophosphorylation on multiple serine/threonine residues within a serine/threonine-rich region, which is important for substrate recognition and proper functioning (fleig2014trpm7 pages 9-12, schmucker2023regulatorymechanismsof pages 84-85). Structural studies, including cryo-electron microscopy and modeling efforts, have elucidated that the kinase domain has a fold resembling that of classical kinases with a nucleotide-binding site, a catalytic loop, and regions for metal coordination, although its sequence lacks the typical catalytic motifs found in standard protein kinases and is instead classified among the α-kinases (gao2022palmitoylationandregulation pages 53-58, owsianik2006structure–functionrelationshipof pages 7-9).\n\n6. Regulation  \nRegulation of TRPM7 occurs at multiple levels via mechanisms that involve direct binding of intracellular cations, post-translational modifications, lipid interactions, and proteolytic processing. The ion channel component is constitutively active under basal conditions; however, its activity is strongly suppressed by intracellular Mg²⁺ and Mg·ATP, which bind to distinct regulatory sites on both the channel region and the kinase domain, thereby modulating the open probability of the channel (chubanov2012theemergingrole pages 134-137, runnels2011trpm6andtrpm7 pages 8-9). Activation of phospholipase C-coupled receptors leads to hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP₂), which subsequently reduces TRPM7 activity as PIP₂ is essential for maintaining channel conformation (chubanov2020mappingtrpm7function pages 1-3, yee2014cellularanddevelopmental pages 8-10). The kinase domain undergoes extensive autophosphorylation within its serine/threonine-rich region, a modification that does not directly influence ion conduction but is thought to enhance substrate recognition and possibly alter kinase substrate specificity (fleig2014trpm7 pages 9-12, runnels2011trpm6andtrpm7 pages 2-3). Under certain cellular conditions, the kinase domain can be proteolytically cleaved, releasing a catalytic fragment that translocates to the nucleus and participates in chromatin remodeling by phosphorylating histones and other nuclear substrates, thereby linking TRPM7 activity to transcriptional regulation (chubanov2020mappingtrpm7function pages 7-9, schmucker2023regulatorymechanismsof pages 18-22). Moreover, regulatory interactions with other proteins such as CNNM magnesium transporters and the ARL15 GTPase further modulate TRPM7’s channel and kinase activities, integrating its function within broader networks of ion homeostasis and signaling (gao2022palmitoylationandregulation pages 58-62, jolly2025thepactnetwork pages 34-35).\n\n7. Function  \nTRPM7 plays a central role in maintaining cellular divalent cation homeostasis by facilitating the influx of calcium (Ca²⁺), magnesium (Mg²⁺), and zinc (Zn²⁺) ions, which are vital for numerous intracellular signaling pathways and metabolic processes (chubanov2005emergingrolesof pages 2-3, yee2014cellularanddevelopmental pages 3-6). Its channel function is crucial for acute regulation of cytosolic ion concentrations, influencing processes such as vesicular zinc release and intracellular Ca²⁺ signaling, while its kinase activity modulates downstream signaling proteins through phosphorylation events (chubanov2012theemergingrole pages 139-141, fleig2014trpm7 pages 6-9). In vivo, TRPM7 is indispensable for embryonic development, as evidenced by genetic ablation studies that result in early embryonic lethality or severe developmental anomalies, highlighting its role in processes such as cell proliferation, motility, and differentiation (chubanov2012theemergingrole pages 141-143, runnels2011trpm6andtrpm7 pages 8-9). In addition, TRPM7-mediated phosphorylation of SMAD2 implicates the channel-kinase in TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathways, which are important for cell growth and differentiation (Information section, chubanov2020mappingtrpm7function pages 1-3). The protein is also upregulated in several cancers and has been associated with cellular senescence, immune responses, and vascular remodeling, thereby underscoring its multifaceted roles in both normal physiology and disease (chubanov2012theemergingrole pages 134-137, jolly2025thepactnetwork pages 22-23). Expression analyses indicate that TRPM7 is ubiquitously distributed among diverse tissues, including the heart, kidney, brain, and immune cells, which is consistent with its broad functional importance in the regulation of cellular ion homeostasis and signaling (nilius2011thetransientreceptor pages 2-4, yee2014cellularanddevelopmental pages 21-23).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral pharmacological modulators have been identified that affect TRPM7 channel activity, including naturally derived compounds and synthetic agents such as waixenicin A, NS8593, and naltriben, which exhibit Mg²⁺-dependent inhibition or activation of the channel (chubanov2014naturalandsynthetic pages 1-3, chubanov2020mappingtrpm7function pages 7-9). Dysregulation or mutations affecting TRPM7 have been linked to a variety of pathological conditions, including hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia, aberrant cell proliferation, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer, making it a promising therapeutic target in these settings (chubanov2012theemergingrole pages 139-141, jolly2025thepactnetwork pages 22-23). Although specific disease mutations have been described—such as mutations that impair channel assembly or disrupt magnesium sensitivity—the detailed impact of these variants on cellular function and clinical outcomes remains an area of active investigation (jolly2025thepactnetwork pages 34-35, runnels2011trpm6andtrpm7 pages 8-9). In addition, post-translational modifications such as palmitoylation, which influences TRPM7 trafficking and membrane localization, further add to the complexity of its regulation and have been proposed as potential targets for modulating its function in disease (gao2022palmitoylationandregulation pages 239-242, gao2022palmitoylationandregulation pages 46-49).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nSerine/threonine‐protein kinase tousled‐like 1 (TLK1) belongs to the Tousled‐like kinase (TLK) family, which is highly conserved among multicellular eukaryotes. TLK1, together with its paralog TLK2, is present in mammals and can be traced evolutionarily from plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana to humans, while being notably absent in unicellular fungi such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae (sillje1999mammalianhomologuesof pages 9-10, benedetti2012thetousledlikekinases pages 2-3). The TLK family forms part of the broader protein kinase superfamily and is classified within the serine/threonine kinases. Their phylogenetic distribution is consistent with an essential role in multicellular development and cellular homeostasis, and their conservation suggests that the catalytic mechanisms and regulation of TLKs are maintained across species (sillje1999mammalianhomologuesof pages 9-10).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nTLK1 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to specific serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins. The general chemical reaction is as follows:  \n  ATP + [protein]–(L‐serine or L‐threonine) → ADP + [protein]–(phospho-L‐serine/threonine) + H⁺  \nThis reaction is characteristic of serine/threonine kinases, conferring the ability to modulate the function of proteins by phosphorylation (benedetti2012thetousledlikekinases pages 2-3).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nLike most serine/threonine kinases, TLK1 requires divalent metal ions to coordinate ATP binding and catalysis. In vitro studies as well as comparisons with well‐characterized kinases confirm that TLK1 activity depends on Mg²⁺ as the primary cofactor, which serves to position ATP correctly within the catalytic pocket for efficient phosphate transfer (benedetti2012thetousledlikekinases pages 2-3).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nTLK1 exhibits substrate specificity that involves phosphorylation of targets implicated in chromatin dynamics and DNA damage responses. Key substrates include:  \n• Histone H3, phosphorylated on serine 10 in vitro, a modification associated with chromatin condensation and replication–dependent chromatin assembly (benedetti2012thetousledlikekinases pages 1-2, sunavala‐dossabhoy2018preservingsalivarygland pages 6-7).  \n• The DNA damage checkpoint protein Rad9 where phosphorylation (for example at serine 328) modulates its association with the 9-1-1 complex following double-stranded break repair, thereby influencing checkpoint recovery (benedetti2012thetousledlikekinases pages 2-3).  \n• Isoform 3 of TLK1 phosphorylates the t-SNARE SNAP23, enhancing its stability and promoting its assembly with syntaxin, a process integral to membrane fusion events in cellular repair and vesicular transport (khalil2022tousledlikekinase1 pages 1-3).  \nAlthough detailed consensus substrate motifs have not been fully delineated in the available literature, the substrate repertoire of TLK1 centers on proteins involved in chromatin assembly, DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint regulation (khalil2022tousledlikekinase1 pages 1-3, sunavala‐dossabhoy2018preservingsalivarygland pages 6-7).\n\n5. Structure  \nThe domain organization of TLK1 encompasses a large N-terminal regulatory region and a C-terminal catalytic domain. The C-terminal domain contains the conserved serine/threonine kinase catalytic module common to many eukaryotic kinases, including conserved motifs that mediate ATP binding and catalysis. In addition, TLK1 features predicted coiled-coil motifs within its N-terminal region that are believed to facilitate dimerization or oligomerization, which is an essential aspect of full catalytic activity (sillje1999mammalianhomologuesof pages 9-10, buron2014theroleof pages 43-48). Structural models generated from experimental data or predicted by AlphaFold reveal that the kinase domain of TLK1 is organized into the canonical small N-terminal lobe and larger C-terminal lobe structure seen in many serine/threonine kinases. The activation loop, hydrophobic spine, and the C-helix are present and are considered crucial for the regulation of catalytic activity; however, unique structural features such as extended regulatory regions may contribute to specialized functions in chromatin assembly. Isoform 3, which has been implicated in phosphorylating SNAP23, retains the catalytic C-terminal domain while having a distinct N-terminal segment that likely imparts substrate specificity and regulatory control (buron2014theroleof pages 43-48, paya2021thetousledlikekinases pages 37-40).\n\n6. Regulation  \nTLK1 activity is tightly regulated by cell cycle and DNA damage response mechanisms. During the S-phase, TLK1 exhibits maximal activity to participate in processes such as chromatin assembly and DNA replication. However, following the generation of DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs), TLK1 is rapidly and transiently inhibited via phosphorylation events that are checkpoint- and ATM-pathway dependent (benedetti2012thetousledlikekinases pages 2-3, khalil2022tousledlikekinase1 pages 1-3). In particular, checkpoint kinase CHK1 has been implicated in phosphorylating TLK1 upon genotoxic stress, leading to a reduction in its kinase activity—a regulatory strategy that prevents premature chromatin assembly during active DNA damage repair (sunavala‐dossabhoy2018preservingsalivarygland pages 6-7). Furthermore, such regulatory phosphorylation events are reversible, which allows TLK1 to resume activity once repair is complete and proper cell cycle progression is re-established. The mechanism of TLK1 regulation is thus integrated with the overall DNA damage and replication checkpoint network, ensuring that TLK1-mediated processes such as chromatin assembly occur only under appropriate cellular conditions (benedetti2012thetousledlikekinases pages 2-3, khalil2022tousledlikekinase1 pages 1-3).\n\n7. Function  \nTLK1 functions as a critical mediator of genome stability by linking chromatin assembly with the DNA damage response and cell cycle regulation. Its primary biological roles include:  \n• Facilitation of chromatin assembly during DNA replication by phosphorylating histone chaperones such as ASF1, thereby ensuring proper nucleosome assembly on newly replicated DNA (benedetti2012thetousledlikekinases pages 2-3, buron2014theroleof pages 43-48).  \n• Regulation of the DNA damage response through phosphorylation of Rad9, a component of the 9-1-1 checkpoint complex, which influences checkpoint deactivation and permits cell cycle re-entry once DNA repair is completed (benedetti2012thetousledlikekinases pages 2-3).  \n• Protection of cells from ionizing radiation. Isoform 3 of TLK1 phosphorylates and enhances the stability of SNAP23, which in turn augments the assembly of SNAP23 with syntaxin, a process that facilitates repair of DNA double-stranded breaks and contributes to radioresistance (khalil2022tousledlikekinase1 pages 1-3).  \n• Phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 in vitro, a modification that has been associated with chromosomal condensation during mitosis as well as potentially modulating chromatin states during replication and repair (benedetti2012thetousledlikekinases pages 1-2, sunavala‐dossabhoy2018preservingsalivarygland pages 6-7).  \nTLK1 is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues with its activity predominantly peaking during S-phase when DNA replication and repair processes are most active. The protein operates as a nexus integrating signals from cell cycle checkpoints and the DNA damage response, ensuring that chromatin assembly and related cellular processes are coordinated with genomic integrity maintenance (khalil2022tousledlikekinase1 pages 1-3, buron2014theroleof pages 144-147).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nExperimental inhibitor screens have been conducted with TLK family members, and although specific TLK1 inhibitors have not achieved the same level of investigation as some other kinases, their role in maintaining genome stability continues to render them attractive targets for therapeutic intervention in cancers that exhibit aberrant DNA repair dynamics. TLK1’s involvement in safeguarding cells against ionizing radiation and its contribution to radioresistance in carcinoma models point to its potential relevance in cancer therapy, particularly in strategies aimed at sensitizing tumor cells to DNA-damaging agents (benedetti2012thetousledlikekinases pages 2-3, buron2014theroleof pages 144-147). Notable disease associations include its implications in cancer progression due to failures in cell cycle regulation and DNA repair, and its activity may serve as a biomarker for cellular responses to genotoxic stress. Furthermore, the differential functionalities between TLK1 isoforms, such as the unique role of isoform 3 in SNAP23 regulation, underscore the complexity of TLK1 functions and may eventually inform the development of isoform-specific inhibitors. The current literature provides a strong foundation for understanding TLK1’s role in chromatin dynamics while also indicating that further structural and mechanistic studies are needed to delineate the full spectrum of its substrate specificities and regulatory interactions (khalil2022tousledlikekinase1 pages 1-3, sunavala‐dossabhoy2018preservingsalivarygland pages 6-7).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nSerine/threonine‐protein kinase tousled‐like 2 (TLK2; UniProt Q86UE8) is a conserved enzyme that belongs to the Tousled‐like kinase family, a group of serine/threonine kinases with orthologs in plants, animals, and other eukaryotes. TLK2 is related to a set of nuclear kinases that are found in species as diverse as Arabidopsis thaliana, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and mammals, indicating an origin in the common ancestor of eukaryotes. Within kinome classifications based on conserved catalytic domains, TLK2 is recognized as part of the serine/threonine kinase superfamily and is often phylogenetically associated with the CMGC group, as its domain organization and regulatory characteristics bear similarities to kinases involved in genome maintenance and cell cycle regulation (champion2004arabidopsiskinomeafter pages 2-4, mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 1-2). This evolutionary conservation places TLK2 in an ancient “housekeeping” kinase family where gene duplications have given rise to paralogs with largely overlapping functions in chromatin assembly, DNA replication, and repair. Although detailed phylogenetic tree reconstructions from early kinome studies (Manning et al.) specifically separate TLK2 from many well‐characterized families (such as AGC or CAMK) by its unique sequence insertions in the catalytic domain, the overall conclusion is that TLK2 resides in a distinct branch that is preserved across diverse eukaryotes (manning2011theminimalkinome pages 5-6, lehtishiu2012diversityclassificationand pages 10-11).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nTLK2 catalyzes the transfer of the γ‐phosphate group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on specific protein substrates. In the canonical reaction it uses ATP and a protein substrate having an accessible hydroxyl group on a serine or threonine residue to generate ADP, a phosphorylated protein product, and a proton (H⁺). This phosphorylation reaction contributes directly to the regulation of substrate stability and activity, as exemplified by its phosphorylation of chromatin assembly factors ASF1A and ASF1B (mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 1-2, champion2004arabidopsiskinomeafter pages 2-4).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of TLK2, as with many serine/threonine kinases, is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions. In particular, TLK2 requires Mg²⁺ as a cofactor to facilitate the proper positioning and transfer of the γ‐phosphate from ATP to the substrate. This reliance on magnesium is consistent with the biochemical features of its catalytic domain and typical catalytic mechanisms observed among serine/threonine kinases (champion2004arabidopsiskinomeafter pages 2-4, mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 3-4).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nTLK2 has been shown to phosphorylate specific substrates that are central to chromatin assembly and cell cycle regulation. Among these substrates are the histone chaperones ASF1A and ASF1B, phosphorylation of which prevents their proteasome‐mediated degradation and thereby enhances chromatin assembly. While a precise consensus motif for TLK2 has not been universally defined in the available literature, experimental observations indicate that TLK2 discriminates between generic kinase substrates such as myelin basic protein (MBP) and physiological substrates like ASF1A, implying that substrate engagement may depend on additional structural determinants beyond a simple linear motif (mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 2-3, mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 3-4). Detailed substrate specificity analyses using high‐throughput methods for the human serine/threonine kinome suggest that kinases with similar functions tend to prefer substrates that harbor specific amino acid environments; however, for TLK2 the most salient functional information remains its activity on ASF1 family proteins (lehtishiu2012diversityclassificationand pages 8-8, mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 9-9).\n\n5. Structure  \nTLK2 possesses a multidomain organization that is essential for its activity and regulation. Its primary structure includes the following key regions:  \n• An N‐terminal region that contains a predicted nuclear localization signal (NLS). This region is involved in the nuclear targeting of TLK2, and its deletion leads to cytoplasmic mislocalization, which in turn may affect TLK2 function in DNA replication and repair (mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 2-3).  \n• Multiple coiled‐coil (CC) domains. These domains mediate dimerization and oligomerization. Experimental work has demonstrated that the coiled‐coil domains, particularly CC1, are critical for dimer formation and for facilitating autophosphorylation, which activates TLK2. Structural analyses using size‐exclusion chromatography coupled with multi‐angle light scattering have confirmed that the full-length or ΔN-TLK2 forms dimers, with autophosphorylation events concentrated in regions overlapping the CC domains (mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 3-4, mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 6-7).  \n• A central kinase domain. This domain is responsible for the catalytic transfer of phosphate and shares structural features common to serine/threonine kinases. Notably, the kinase domain of TLK2 has a conserved bilobed structure comprising an α/β N-terminal lobe and a larger C-terminal lobe. Within this domain, the P-loop (GxGxxS motif, as opposed to the canonical GxGxxG sequence), the catalytic loop, the activation segment (T-loop), and the DFG motif for metal coordination are present. Intriguingly, TLK2 does not possess a canonical His–Arg–Asp (HRD or RD) motif in the catalytic loop; instead, a tyrosine residue is present, suggesting a unique mechanism of regulation when compared with many classical serine/threonine kinases (mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 9-9).  \n• A C-terminal tail. This region is involved in further regulatory autophosphorylation events that are essential for full activation. Phosphorylation in the C-terminal tail has been correlated with changes in TLK2 catalytic efficiency and oligomerization state, as specific mutations in this region demonstrate alterations in substrate phosphorylation patterns (mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 11-13).  \n\nOverall, the 3D organization of TLK2, as revealed by crystallographic studies and supported by biochemical characterization, shows that the catalytic activity is tightly coupled to the structural integrity of the kinase domain and its regulatory regions. The interplay between the coiled-coil mediated dimerization, autophosphorylation sites in both the kinase domain and the C-terminal tail, and the nuclear localization sequence collectively underscore a complex mode of regulation that enables TLK2 to function effectively in the nucleus (mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 3-4, mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 6-7).\n\n6. Regulation  \nTLK2 activity is subject to intricate regulatory mechanisms that ensure its proper function during the S-phase of the cell cycle and in DNA damage response pathways. The following regulatory features have been characterized:  \n• Autophosphorylation. TLK2 undergoes extensive autophosphorylation on serine and threonine residues within its kinase domain, coiled-coil regions, and C-terminal tail. This autophosphorylation occurs both in cis (within an individual monomer) and in trans (across monomers in a dimer), and is essential for the transition to a fully active conformation. Specific autophosphorylation events have been mapped to residues within the CC domains and the C-terminal tail, and experimental analysis using kinase-dead mutants confirms that autophosphorylation contributes significantly to its activation (mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 11-13, mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 2-3).  \n• Domain-dependent regulation. The N-terminal region appears to play a negative regulatory role; its deletion (yielding ΔN-TLK2) results in an increase in both autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation. This observation indicates that extrakinetic regulatory elements modulate the kinase's activity, possibly through intramolecular interactions that restrain the active conformation under basal conditions (mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 3-4, mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 4-5).  \n• Oligomerization. The CC domains mediate dimerization, and further oligomer formation is promoted by phosphorylation. This oligomerization is a key determinant of substrate recognition, as isolated kinase domains lacking the CC regions exhibit markedly reduced activity. Dimerization facilitates the unimolecular process of autophosphorylation and appears to be required for efficient phosphorylation of physiological substrates (mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 6-7, mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 7-9).  \n• Regulation by external kinases. Although TLK2 is capable of self-activation through autophosphorylation, it is also reported to be regulated by other kinases in response to DNA damage. For example, phosphorylation by checkpoint kinases such as CHK1 at conserved sites in the C-terminal tail has been implicated in dampening TLK2 activity under stress conditions (mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 15-16, mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 16-16).\n\n7. Function  \nTLK2 plays a pivotal role in several nuclear processes that are central to genome stability and cell cycle progression. Its well-documented functions include:  \n• Chromatin assembly. TLK2 phosphorylates the histone chaperones ASF1A and ASF1B. The phosphorylation event on ASF1A is critical for preventing its proteasome-mediated degradation, thereby sustaining an adequate supply of histone chaperones during chromatin assembly. This function is essential during DNA replication when new chromatin must be rapidly assembled following replication fork progression (mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 1-2, mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 2-3).  \n• DNA replication, repair, and transcription. Beyond chromatin assembly, TLK2 is implicated in broader aspects of DNA metabolism. It is involved in DNA replication and has been linked to transcription and DNA repair processes. The ability to modulate ASF1 levels and thus influence chromatin structure ties TLK2 to the regulation of transcriptional programs and to the cellular response to DNA damage (champion2004arabidopsiskinomeafter pages 2-4, mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 15-16).  \n• Cell cycle regulation. TLK2 is most active during the S-phase, ensuring that the processes of DNA replication and chromatin assembly are coordinated. Its involvement in these fundamental processes makes it a key component of the cell cycle machinery (mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 1-2, mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 2-3).  \n• Regulation of autophagy. TLK2 has been identified as a negative regulator of amino acid starvation-induced autophagy. This regulatory role further connects TLK2 to the intricate balance between growth, survival, and stress responses in the cell (Information provided in the summary description, supported by PubMed identifiers in the protein information).  \n\nInteracting partners of TLK2 include its substrates (ASF1A and ASF1B) and potentially other chromatin regulators and DNA repair proteins, indicating that TLK2 functions within a network of proteins that safeguard genome integrity. Experimental evidence supports its role in promoting chromatin assembly and maintaining nuclear homeostasis during replication and in response to DNA damage (mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 1-2, mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 2-3).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral aspects of TLK2 are of particular interest from both a basic science and a therapeutic perspective. Notably, TLK2 has been implicated in disease processes, with mutations and dysregulation linked to intellectual disability and cancer. Amplification or altered regulation of TLK2 may contribute to aggressive tumor behavior by disrupting normal chromatin assembly and DNA repair pathways (mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 15-16, mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 9-10).  \nExperimental inhibitors targeting TLK2 have been investigated using molecular docking approaches that highlight the ATP-binding pocket as a potential target. For example, studies have evaluated the effects of compounds such as indirubin derivatives and other small molecules on TLK2 activity. Although none of the inhibitors have been established as clinically approved drugs, these studies underscore the potential for developing therapeutic agents that specifically modulate TLK2 kinase activity (mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 11-13, reyes2018validationofnew pages 6-10).  \nIn addition, TLK2 is characterized by highly conserved catalytic and regulatory domains and exhibits distinct structural features such as the unusual P-loop sequence and absence of a canonical RD motif, which may be exploited for designing selective inhibitors. Its regulation by autophosphorylation and interaction with key chromatin assembly factors presents opportunities for further exploration of TLK2 as a biomarker or therapeutic target in diseases related to genomic instability (champion2004arabidopsiskinomeafter pages 2-4, mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 9-9).\n\n9.

Acts downstream of several Rho family GTPase signal transduction pathways (PubMed:10436159, PubMed:11832213, PubMed:12807904, PubMed:15660133, PubMed:16230460, PubMed:18028908, PubMed:22328514, PubMed:23633677). Activated by upstream kinases including ROCK1, PAK1 and PAK4, which phosphorylate LIMK1 on a threonine residue located in its activation loop (PubMed:10436159). LIMK1 subsequently phosphorylates and inactivates the actin binding/depolymerizing factors cofilin-1/CFL1, cofilin-2/CFL2 and destrin/DSTN, thereby preventing the cleavage of filamentous actin (F-actin), and stabilizing the actin cytoskeleton (PubMed:11832213, PubMed:15660133, PubMed:16230460, PubMed:23633677). In this way LIMK1 regulates several actin-dependent biological processes including cell motility, cell cycle progression, and differentiation (PubMed:11832213, PubMed:15660133, PubMed:16230460, PubMed:23633677). Phosphorylates TPPP on serine residues, thereby promoting microtubule disassembly (PubMed:18028908). Stimulates axonal outgrowth and may be involved in brain development (PubMed:18028908)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nLIM domain kinase 1 (LIMK1) is a member of the LIM kinase family that is conserved in metazoans and has undergone diversification in vertebrates, where two distinct isoforms—LIMK1 and LIMK2—are found. LIMK1 is phylogenetically confined to higher eukaryotes such as mammals, birds, amphibians, and fish, and it shares a common ancestral origin with other kinases involved in actin regulation, including the TES kinases and slingshot phosphatases. Its evolutionary emergence appears to coincide with increasing organismal complexity, reflected by the acquisition of multiple protein–protein interaction domains (i.e., LIM and PDZ domains) that are absent in simpler eukaryotes, thereby demonstrating the functional specialization of the kinome in vertebrates (briedis2008thedistributionand pages 164-169, chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 1-3).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nLIMK1 catalyzes the transfer of the gamma phosphate from ATP to specific hydroxyl groups on protein substrates. In its canonical reaction, ATP is utilized as the phosphate donor to phosphorylate target serine residues on actin-depolymerizing factors such as cofilin, converting unphosphorylated cofilin into phospho-cofilin and producing ADP and a proton as byproducts. In addition to cofilin, LIMK1 has the capacity to phosphorylate other substrates including TPPP on specific serine residues, thereby linking its activity to microtubule disassembly as well (chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 1-3, manetti2012limkinasesare pages 1-3).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nAs with most protein kinases, LIMK1 requires the binding of ATP in a catalytic pocket coordinated by divalent metal ions, with Mg²⁺ serving as the primary cofactor. The binding of Mg²⁺ facilitates the proper orientation of ATP’s phosphate groups and stabilizes the transition state during the phosphoryl-transfer reaction (chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 3-4).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nLIMK1 displays a distinctive substrate specificity characterized by its phosphorylation of the actin-depolymerizing factors cofilin-1, cofilin-2, and destrin predominantly at a conserved serine residue (Ser3) in cofilin. This phosphorylation event inactivates cofilin’s filament-severing activity, thereby stabilizing polymerized actin structures. Moreover, LIMK1 is recognized as a dual-specificity kinase given that in vitro studies have demonstrated its ability to transfer phosphate to tyrosine residues under certain conditions. Unlike conventional kinases that require a tightly bound phosphoacceptor loop, LIMK1 employs a unique ‘rock-and-poke’ mechanism whereby substrates such as cofilin bind via a distal anchor helix and subsequently “rock” into the active site to position their N-terminal phosphoacceptor residue for catalysis (chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 4-6, manetti2012limkinasesare pages 1-3).\n\n5. Structure  \nLIMK1 features a modular domain organization with an N-terminal region comprising two LIM domains and an adjacent PDZ domain that are central to protein–protein interactions and subcellular localization. The LIM domains—each constituted by two zinc finger motifs—are implicated in mediating intramolecular interactions that autoinhibit the kinase domain, while the PDZ domain supports interactions with target proteins and can influence nuclear–cytoplasmic shuttling. The C-terminal region of LIMK1 contains the catalytic kinase domain that adopts the classical bilobed kinase fold, consisting of a smaller N-terminal lobe primarily comprising β-sheets and a larger C-terminal lobe made of α-helices; within this domain, the ATP-binding cleft lies at the interface between the two lobes (chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 1-3). Key catalytic features include the activation loop, whose phosphorylation at threonine residue 508 is critical for stabilizing the active “DFG-in” conformation, and the surrounding DFG motif that coordinates Mg²⁺-bound ATP. Additional structural determinants such as the G-rich loop, catalytic loop, and a shifted αG helix create a unique and relatively shallow substrate-binding pocket; this configuration supports the ‘rock-and-poke’ mechanism that permits LIMK1 to phosphorylate substrates without conventional extensive interactions with the phosphoacceptor loop (chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 3-4, chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 10-11, villalonga2023limkinaseslimk1 pages 2-6).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe activity of LIMK1 is tightly controlled by multiple regulatory mechanisms that include both post-translational modifications and conformational changes mediated by domain interactions. A key regulatory modification is phosphorylation of its activation loop at threonine 508, primarily executed by upstream kinases such as Rho-associated kinase (ROCK1) and p21-activated kinases (PAK1 and PAK4). Phosphorylation at this pivotal site promotes a conformational change from an inactive DFG-out to an active DFG-in state, enabling efficient ATP binding and catalytic function. LIMK1 also undergoes autophosphorylation on serine and tyrosine residues; however, the activation loop phosphorylation appears to be the most critical event for its full activation (chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 10-11, manetti2012limkinasesare pages 3-6). In its unphosphorylated state, the N-terminal LIM and PDZ domains contribute to autoinhibition by interacting with the kinase domain, and proteolytic cleavage events (for instance by caspase-3) can remove these regulatory domains, resulting in constitutive activation. Additional regulation is provided by interactions with molecular chaperones such as Hsp90, which promote homodimerization and transphosphorylation of LIMK1. Moreover, dephosphorylation events mediated by slingshot (SSH) phosphatases serve as a counterbalance to LIMK1 activity by removing phosphate groups from the activation loop, thereby reducing kinase activity (manetti2012limkinasesare pages 3-6, villalonga2023limkinaseslimk1 pages 6-7).\n\n7. Function  \nBiologically, LIMK1 plays a crucial role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, acting as a downstream effector in signaling cascades initiated by Rho family GTPases such as Rac, Cdc42, and Rho. Through its phosphorylation of cofilin at Ser3, LIMK1 inactivates cofilin and prevents the disassembly of filamentous actin (F-actin), which in turn modulates cell motility, cell cycle progression, and cellular differentiation. This regulation of actin dynamics is central to processes including cell migration, neuronal axonal outgrowth, synaptic plasticity, and cell adhesion. In addition to its role in actin cytoskeleton control, LIMK1 phosphorylates substrates such as TPPP, thereby influencing microtubule disassembly and contributing to the dynamic reorganization of the cytoskeleton. LIMK1 is predominantly expressed in neural tissues, including the brain where it is implicated in axonal development and synaptic function, yet it is also present in tissues such as heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and lung. As a node in signaling pathways, LIMK1 receives activating inputs from kinases like ROCK and PAK and, by phosphorylating key substrates such as cofilin, translates extracellular cues into cytoskeletal remodeling events that affect cell morphology and migratory behavior (briedis2008thedistributionand pages 212-214, villalonga2023limkinaseslimk1 pages 1-2, chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 10-11).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nA variety of small-molecule inhibitors targeting LIMK1 have been investigated, including bis-aryl urea derivatives that have shown potency and selectivity in inhibiting LIMK1 activity. These inhibitors function by targeting the ATP-binding cleft or allosteric sites that are accessible in the inactive DFG-out conformation of the kinase; however, since the active phosphorylated form (DFG-in) displays reduced affinity for such inhibitors, developing isoform-specific and state-selective inhibitors remains a key challenge. LIMK1 dysfunction has been implicated in several pathological processes including neurological disorders—such as those associated with synaptic plasticity defects—and various cancers where aberrant cell migration and invasion are observed. Inhibitory strategies are further complicated by the fact that LIMK1 is predominantly expressed in neural tissues, and its inhibition can lead to adverse effects such as impaired platelet function and decreased osteoblast numbers, emphasizing the need for careful therapeutic targeting (yin2015bisarylureaderivatives pages 23-25, villalonga2023limkinaseslimk1 pages 31-32, chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 10-11).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nLIM domain kinase 2 (LIMK2) belongs to the LIM kinase family, which comprises two closely related members, LIMK1 and LIMK2, and is evolutionarily conserved among vertebrates as well as in many lower eukaryotes. Orthologs of LIMK2 can be identified across a broad range of species, indicating its origin early in the evolution of eukaryotic serine/threonine kinases (brion2021limkinasesin pages 1-2, lateef2024limkinasesin pages 2-4). Within the kinome, LIMK2 is grouped with other dual-specificity kinases that share a unique LIM domain architecture; these LIM domains are characterized by a double zinc finger motif that is conserved among the family members and serve as modules for protein–protein interactions. The evolutionary relationship between LIMK2 and its paralog LIMK1 reveals approximately 50% overall sequence identity with increased conservation within the catalytic (kinase) domains (approximately 70% identity) (manetti2012limkinasesare pages 1-3, villalonga2023limkinaseslimk1 pages 1-2). This evolutionary lineage places LIMK2 in a group of kinases that are not only crucial for the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics but also serve as key downstream effectors in Rho family GTPase signaling cascades (goyal2005dualfunctionof pages 24-28).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nLIMK2 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to target proteins, primarily phosphorylating serine/threonine residues on substrate proteins such as cofilin. The chemical reaction it mediates can be summarized as follows: ATP + [protein]‐(L‐serine/threonine) → ADP + [protein]‐(L‐serine/threonine)‐phosphate + H⁺ (brion2021limkinasesin pages 2-4, chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 1-3). This catalytic activity is central to its role in modulating the activity of proteins that control actin filament dynamics and thus impacts various cellular behaviors including motility and mitotic processes.\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of LIMK2 is dependent upon the presence of divalent metal ions that act as essential cofactors for the binding and proper orientation of ATP within the catalytic cleft. In particular, Mg²⁺ is required as a cofactor to facilitate the transfer of the phosphate group from ATP to the substrate protein (chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 6-8). This cofactor requirement is characteristic of many protein kinases and is critical for achieving the active conformation of the enzyme.\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nLIMK2 demonstrates substrate specificity predominantly for actin‐regulating proteins. Its best‐characterized substrate is cofilin, an actin‐depolymerizing factor, which undergoes phosphorylation at serine 3, thereby leading to its inactivation and resulting in stabilization of actin filaments (brion2021limkinasesin pages 2-4, mashiachfarkash2012computerbasedidentificationof pages 2-4). In addition to cofilin, LIMK2 has been shown in vitro to phosphorylate myelin basic protein (MBP) and histone proteins, although these substrates are primarily used to demonstrate kinase activity under experimental conditions (brion2021limkinasesin pages 2-4). Furthermore, LIMK2 is involved in the phosphorylation of TPPP, a protein implicated in microtubule polymerization, which links its activity to astral microtubule organization and mitotic spindle orientation (brion2021limkinasesin pages 2-4). The substrate consensus motif tends to favor serine/threonine residues flanked by sequences that allow docking via the non-catalytic LIM and PDZ domains, although the precise amino acid consensus determined by high-throughput assays remains less clearly defined than for some other serine/threonine kinases (jiang2023pdzandlim pages 14-16).\n\n5. Structure  \nLIMK2 displays a modular structure that is central to its function and regulation. Its N-terminal region comprises two LIM domains, each of which forms a zinc finger motif that coordinates zinc ions through conserved cysteine and histidine residues; these domains mediate protein–protein interactions and can exert autoinhibitory influence over the kinase activity (manetti2012limkinasesare pages 1-3, villalonga2023limkinaseslimk1 pages 2-6). Adjacent to the LIM domains, LIMK2 harbors a PDZ domain, which also facilitates specific interactions with target proteins and contributes to subcellular localization dynamics by engaging nuclear export signals (villalonga2023limkinaseslimk1 pages 2-6). This is followed by a serine/proline-rich region, which may function as a flexible linker that permits communication between the regulatory domains and the catalytic domain. The C-terminal kinase domain is responsible for its catalytic function and exhibits the classic bilobal fold characteristic of protein kinases. Key catalytic features include the activation loop, which contains the critical threonine residue (Thr505 in LIMK2) whose phosphorylation is necessary for full enzymatic activity; other important structural motifs include the glycine-rich loop responsible for ATP binding and the C-helix that participates in forming the active site (chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 4-6, manetti2012limkinasesare pages 11-14). Furthermore, unique features such as a noncanonical DLNSHN motif in the catalytic subdomain provide LIMK2 with the ability to phosphorylate both serine/threonine and, in some contexts, tyrosine residues, underscoring its classification as a dual-specificity kinase (villalonga2023limkinaseslimk1 pages 9-10, yin2015bisarylureaderivatives pages 1-3).\n\n6. Regulation  \nLIMK2 is subject to complex regulation via post-translational modifications and interactions with upstream signaling molecules. Its activation is primarily achieved through phosphorylation by kinases activated downstream of small Rho GTPases. For instance, Rho-associated kinases (ROCK1/2) and p21-activated kinases (PAKs) phosphorylate LIMK2 at Thr505 within its activation loop, which shifts the enzyme into an active conformation (goyal2005dualfunctionof pages 24-28, chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 10-11). Aurora A kinase is also an upstream regulator that phosphorylates LIMK2 at multiple residues, including Ser283 and Thr494, influencing its subcellular localization, stability, and catalytic activity; this forms a positive feedback loop with Aurora A, particularly in cancer cells (johnson2012limk2isa pages 1-2, villalonga2023limkinaseslimk1 pages 13-15). In addition to these kinases, protein kinase C (PKC) has been implicated in regulating LIMK2 via phosphorylation of residues that modulate its nuclear import/export dynamics (goyal2005dualfunctionof pages 118-121, manetti2012limkinasesare pages 16-18). Autoinhibitory interactions mediated by its own LIM and PDZ domains may also constrain the basal activity of LIMK2 until proper upstream signals relieve this inhibition (villalonga2023limkinaseslimk1 pages 2-6). The net outcome of these modifications is the fine-tuning of LIMK2 activity to ensure precise control over actin dynamics under varying cellular conditions (sooreshjani2021identifyingtheversatile pages 23-28).\n\n7. Function  \nLIMK2 plays an essential role in the regulation of actin filament dynamics by phosphorylating cofilin, thereby inhibiting its actin-severing activity and promoting the stabilization of filamentous actin. This function is critical for numerous cellular processes including cell migration, adhesion, and morphological changes during differentiation (brion2021limkinasesin pages 2-4, chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 11-12). Beyond its cytoskeletal role, LIMK2 is involved in astral microtubule organization and the proper orientation of the mitotic spindle during early mitosis by phosphorylating target proteins such as TPPP, linking its activity to cell division and genomic stability (brion2021limkinasesin pages 2-4, goyal2005dualfunctionof pages 127-131). Furthermore, LIMK2 suppresses ciliogenesis through multiple mechanisms: by phosphorylating cofilin (CFL1) and thereby modulating actin dynamics, by inhibiting the directional trafficking of ciliary vesicles toward the ciliary base, and by facilitating the nuclear localization of YAP1, where it functions as a transcriptional corepressor of TEAD4 target genes including AURKA and PLK1 (brion2021limkinasesin pages 2-4, jiang2023pdzandlim pages 16-17). LIMK2 is ubiquitously expressed across a range of tissues and is frequently upregulated in various cancers, where its dysregulation contributes to tumor cell motility, invasion, and metastatic progression (villalonga2023limkinaseslimk1 pages 20-21, ohashi2014damnacanthalaneffective pages 12-13).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nA number of small molecule inhibitors targeting LIMK2 have been reported in the literature, offering potential avenues for therapeutic intervention in diseases where LIMK2 is dysregulated. For example, inhibitors such as T56-LIMKi have been developed with reported selectivity toward LIMK2, and bis-aryl urea derivatives have also demonstrated potent inhibitory activity against both LIMK1 and LIMK2 in biochemical assays (yin2015bisarylureaderivatives pages 23-25, ohashi2014damnacanthalaneffective pages 3-4). LIMK2’s involvement in cancer, particularly in promoting tumor cell migration, invasion, and metastasis, has made it a candidate therapeutic target; its regulation by upstream oncogenic kinases such as Aurora A and ROCK further underscores its potential as a drug target (jiang2023pdzandlim pages 16-17, ritchey2014theroleof pages 149-152). In addition, mutations or altered expression levels of LIMK2 can be linked to defects in mitotic spindle orientation and ciliogenesis, suggesting roles in developmental disorders and diseases related to abnormal ciliary function (brion2021limkinasesin pages 2-4, villalonga2023limkinaseslimk1 pages 17-18). Current research continues to explore the specificity and efficacy of LIMK2 inhibitors using both enzymatic assays and cellular models, and the integration of LIMK2 inhibition with other targeted therapies is under investigation in preclinical models of cancer (ohashi2014damnacanthalaneffective pages 12-13, sooreshjani2021identifyingtheversatile pages 93-97).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase ETK (gene: ETK/yccC; UniProt: P38134) is a member of the bacterial tyrosine kinase (BY kinase) family. These kinases are evolutionarily distinct from eukaryotic receptor tyrosine kinases and do not share canonical Hanks‐type motifs found in most eukaryotic PTKs; instead, they harbor nucleotide‐binding motifs such as Walker A and Walker B, which are broadly conserved among P-loop proteins. In proteobacteria such as Escherichia coli K12, ETK represents the archetypal example of a proteobacterial BY kinase, exhibiting features that have been evolutionarily conserved among prokaryotic systems involved in phosphorylation‐dependent regulation of signal transduction, capsule biosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism (engin2021bacterialproteinkinases pages 329-331, ilan1999proteintyrosinekinases pages 1-2). ETK shares significant sequence similarity with other bacterial protein tyrosine kinases, for example, its close homologues AmsA from Erwinia amylovora and Orf6 from Klebsiella pneumoniae, among others. These kinases have a narrow distribution limited to prokaryotes, and they are generally associated with virulence functions and the regulation of exopolysaccharide production through phosphorylation‐dependent molecular switches (ilan1999proteintyrosinekinases pages 5-6, ilan1999proteintyrosinekinases pages 6-7).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nETK catalyzes the transfer of the γ-phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to specific tyrosine residues located on substrate proteins, including those on its own intracellular C-terminal tail (autophosphorylation). In this reaction, ATP serves as the phosphate donor, and the enzyme converts ATP to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) while phosphorylating the hydroxyl group of the targeted tyrosine residue. This phosphorylation reaction can be summarized by the following chemical equation:  \n  ATP + [protein]-Tyr → ADP + [protein]-phosphotyrosine + H⁺  \nThis catalytic reaction, which is central to the enzyme’s role in signal transduction and regulation of polysaccharide biosynthesis, is a hallmark feature of bacterial tyrosine kinases (engin2021bacterialproteinkinases pages 331-335, ilan1999proteintyrosinekinases pages 2-4, lee2008structuralandfunctional pages 25-30).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of ETK requires ATP as the phosphate donor and is dependent on divalent metal ions, most notably magnesium (Mg²⁺), which plays a crucial role in stabilizing the negative charges of the phosphate groups during catalysis. The enzyme’s catalytic mechanism, mediated by its conserved Walker motifs, is contingent upon the presence of these metal ions to correctly position the ATP and facilitate nucleophilic attack by the tyrosine hydroxyl group (engin2021bacterialproteinkinases pages 329-331, lee2008structuralandfunctional pages 25-30).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nETK exhibits a substrate specificity that is characterized primarily by its ability to autophosphorylate on a short, tyrosine-rich sequence within its intracellular C-terminal domain. This autophosphorylation event is critical for the enzyme’s activation and subsequent downstream signaling functions. In addition, ETK demonstrates the capacity to phosphorylate external substrates such as synthetic tyrosine-rich peptides (e.g., poly(Glu:Tyr)) and regulatory proteins involved in exopolysaccharide assembly, although the precise consensus substrate motif has not been completely delineated in available reports. The substrate specificity is driven by the kinase domain’s recognition of specific tyrosine residues and is modulated by the conformational state of the enzyme; for instance, phosphorylation of a key regulatory tyrosine (Y574) in the active site modulates substrate access and catalytic efficiency (ilan1999proteintyrosinekinases pages 5-6, ilan1999proteintyrosinekinases pages 6-7, lee2008structuralandfunctional pages 138-144).\n\n5. Structure  \nETK is a multi-domain protein that is typically anchored to the plasma membrane via two transmembrane segments, a characteristic feature of bacterial BY kinases. The overall domain organization comprises a short extracellular sensory domain, two transmembrane helices, and a sizable intracellular catalytic domain. The intracellular region harbors conserved motifs critical for nucleotide binding and catalysis, including the Walker A, Walker A′, and Walker B motifs. Structural studies, particularly those using X-ray crystallography of the kinase domain, have revealed a semispherical structure with a central β-sheet core that is flanked by α-helices. A key regulatory feature of the kinase domain is the presence of the tyrosine residue Y574, which when unphosphorylated can sterically block the active site, thereby preventing substrate and cofactor binding; phosphorylation of Y574 induces a conformational shift that repositions its side chain—facilitated by critical interaction with residue R614—to permit substrate access (lee2008structuralandfunctional pages 100-109, lee2008structuralandfunctional pages 109-115). In addition, the intracellular domain contains a C-terminal tyrosine-rich cluster that undergoes multiple autophosphorylation events that are essential for regulating the oligomerization state of the enzyme and its function in polysaccharide export. Studies employing analytical ultracentrifugation and chemical cross-linking have demonstrated that ETK’s N-terminal domain contributes to its oligomerization, forming structures ranging from monomers to tetramers and higher molecular weight aggregates (lee2008structuralandfunctional pages 123-131, lee2008structuralandfunctional pages 144-149).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulatory mechanisms controlling ETK activity are tightly linked to its phosphorylation state. Autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues – notably within the critical C-terminal cluster and the key regulatory residue Y574 – governs the enzyme’s catalytic activity and its oligomeric conformation. In its inactive state, the unphosphorylated Y574 side chain occupies a position within the active site, impeding substrate binding; however, upon autophosphorylation at Y574, a conformational change occurs that relieves this steric blockade and enables catalytic activity (lee2008structuralandfunctional pages 100-109, lee2008structuralandfunctional pages 138-144). Oligomerization is also influenced by the phosphorylation status: fully dephosphorylated ETK tends to form high molecular weight aggregates due to strong intermolecular interactions mediated by non-phosphorylated tyrosine residues in the C-terminal cluster, whereas an intermediate phosphorylation level facilitates the formation of the tetrameric species that are functionally active in the export of capsular polysaccharides (lee2008structuralandfunctional pages 149-156, lee2008structuralandfunctional pages 156-162). In addition, ETK is subject to dephosphorylation by specific tyrosine phosphatases, such as YopH, which serve to inactivate the kinase by removing the phosphate groups and thereby restoring the autoinhibited conformation (ilan1999proteintyrosinekinases pages 7-8, lee2008structuralandfunctional pages 162-167).\n\n7. Function  \nETK plays a central role in bacterial physiology by regulating the synthesis and export of extracellular or capsular polysaccharides (EPS/CPS), which are critical determinants of biofilm formation, virulence, and antibiotic resistance in pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli. Its autophosphorylation and subsequent phosphorylation of downstream regulatory proteins facilitate the assembly and export of high-molecular-weight polysaccharides that form the bacterial capsule, an essential structure for evading host immune responses. In addition to its role in capsule biogenesis, ETK has been implicated in the regulation of carbohydrate transport systems, and functional studies have identified substrate proteins such as UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (Ugd) and other associated components of the polysaccharide export machinery that undergo tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by ETK. Expression of ETK appears to be restricted to pathogenic strains, such as enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), and alterations in its phosphorylation state correlate with changes in virulence phenotypes, including sensitivity to antibiotics like polymyxin B. Consequently, ETK is regarded as a critical regulatory node in bacterial signaling networks that integrate environmental cues to modulate cell envelope composition and, thereby, bacterial fitness during host infection (engin2021bacterialproteinkinases pages 331-335, ilan1999proteintyrosinekinases pages 4-5, lee2008structuralandfunctional pages 25-30, lee2008structuralandfunctional pages 47-52).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nDespite the extensive biochemical and structural characterization of ETK, specific inhibitors for this bacterial tyrosine kinase have not been thoroughly developed or described in the literature provided. However, given its pivotal role in regulating exopolysaccharide synthesis and bacterial virulence, ETK represents a potential target for the development of antimicrobial agents aimed at disrupting capsule formation and biofilm integrity. In this context, ETK’s restricted expression in pathogenic strains further emphasizes its utility as a therapeutic target. No direct information regarding disease associations beyond its contribution to bacterial pathogenicity is available from the sources cited, although its involvement in virulence mechanisms implies that targeting ETK may attenuate bacterial infections (ilan1999proteintyrosinekinases pages 4-5, engin2021bacterialproteinkinases pages 358-360, lee2008structuralandfunctional pages 167-172).\n\n9.

Binding of antigen to the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) triggers signaling that ultimately leads to B-cell activation (PubMed:19290921). After BCR engagement and activation at the plasma membrane, phosphorylates PLCG2 at several sites, igniting the downstream signaling pathway through calcium mobilization, followed by activation of the protein kinase C (PKC) family members (PubMed:11606584). PLCG2 phosphorylation is performed in close cooperation with the adapter protein B-cell linker protein BLNK (PubMed:11606584). BTK acts as a platform to bring together a diverse array of signaling proteins and is implicated in cytokine receptor signaling pathways (PubMed:16517732, PubMed:17932028). Plays an important role in the function of immune cells of innate as well as adaptive immunity, as a component of the Toll-like receptors (TLR) pathway (PubMed:16517732). The TLR pathway acts as a primary surveillance system for the detection of pathogens and are crucial to the activation of host defense (PubMed:16517732). Especially, is a critical molecule in regulating TLR9 activation in splenic B-cells (PubMed:16517732, PubMed:17932028). Within the TLR pathway, induces tyrosine phosphorylation of TIRAP which leads to TIRAP degradation (PubMed:16415872). BTK also plays a critical role in transcription regulation (PubMed:19290921). Induces the activity of NF-kappa-B, which is involved in regulating the expression of hundreds of genes (PubMed:19290921). BTK is involved on the signaling pathway linking TLR8 and TLR9 to NF-kappa-B (PubMed:19290921). Acts as an activator of NLRP3 inflammasome assembly by mediating phosphorylation of NLRP3 (PubMed:34554188). Transiently phosphorylates transcription factor GTF2I on tyrosine residues in response to BCR (PubMed:9012831). GTF2I then translocates to the nucleus to bind regulatory enhancer elements to modulate gene expression (PubMed:9012831). ARID3A and NFAT are other transcriptional target of BTK (PubMed:16738337). BTK is required for the formation of functional ARID3A DNA-binding complexes (PubMed:16738337). There is however no evidence that BTK itself binds directly to DNA (PubMed:16738337). BTK has a dual role in the regulation of apoptosis (PubMed:9751072). Plays a role in STING1-mediated induction of type I interferon (IFN) response by phosphorylating DDX41 (PubMed:25704810)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase BTK is a member of the Tec family of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases, a group that also includes BMX, ITK, TEC, and TXK. BTK is highly conserved among mammals and is found in all species possessing a functional adaptive immune system, suggesting its emergence early in vertebrate evolution. It traces its origin to a premetazoan ancestor, and the Tec family kinases form an evolutionary core set that is related to other central signaling enzymes within the kinome (ortutay2008phylogenyoftec pages 7-10, burger2019brutontyrosinekinase pages 1-3).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nBTK catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to tyrosine residues on protein substrates. The chemical reaction can be represented as: ATP + protein–tyrosine → ADP + protein–phosphotyrosine + H⁺. This phosphorylation event is a critical post‐translational modification that regulates downstream signal transduction cascades in B cells and other immune cells (alu2022btkinhibitorsin pages 3-5, qiu2000signalingnetworkof pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of BTK depends on ATP as a phosphate donor and requires divalent metal ions, predominantly Mg²⁺, as an essential cofactor to facilitate the proper alignment of ATP and the protein substrate in the active site (alu2022btkinhibitorsin pages 3-5, mao2001crystalstructureof pages 5-5).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nBTK exhibits substrate specificity typical of protein tyrosine kinases. It preferentially phosphorylates tyrosine residues on substrate proteins that are key components of the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling cascade. A well‐characterized substrate of BTK is phospholipase C-γ2 (PLCγ2), which, upon phosphorylation, triggers calcium mobilization and activates downstream effectors such as members of the protein kinase C (PKC) family. The substrate specificity is also defined by the context of the surrounding amino acid residues near the target tyrosine, although a strict consensus motif has not been universally established. Instead, the functional substrates are mainly components of the BCR and Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways (alu2022btkinhibitorsin pages 3-5, burger2019brutontyrosinekinase pages 1-3, xing2014brutonstkinhibitors pages 1-2).\n\n5. Structure  \nBTK is a protein of 659 amino acids that is organized into five distinct domains. At its N-terminus, the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain binds phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), mediating the recruitment of BTK to the plasma membrane upon activation of PI3-kinase. Adjacent to the PH domain, the Tec homology (TH) region often contains a zinc-binding motif, which is important for protein stability. BTK further contains Src homology domains SH3 and SH2 that facilitate protein–protein interactions and proper positioning within signaling complexes. The C-terminal kinase domain, also known as the SH1 domain, is responsible for catalytic activity and contains critical regulatory residues, including Tyr551 in the activation loop—phosphorylation at this residue by upstream kinases (such as LYN) is required for full enzymatic activation—and Tyr223 in the SH3 domain, which undergoes autophosphorylation. In addition, the kinase domain houses a conserved cysteine residue (Cys481), which serves as the binding site for covalent inhibitors such as ibrutinib. Structural studies, including crystallographic analyses, have revealed both active and inactive conformations of the BTK kinase domain, highlighting a flexible αC-helix and an activation loop that adopts a conformation conducive to substrate binding once phosphorylated. These features, including the hydrophobic spines and the arrangement of the N- and C-terminal lobes, are essential for catalysis and regulatory control (alu2022btkinhibitorsin pages 3-5, burger2019brutontyrosinekinase pages 1-3, lin2023structureofbtk pages 9-11, mao2001crystalstructureof pages 3-3, tasso2021thedevelopmentof pages 1-2).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe activity of BTK is primarily regulated through phosphorylation and conformational changes. Activation is initiated when membrane recruitment occurs via the PH domain binding to PIP3, facilitating proximity to upstream Src-family kinases. These kinases phosphorylate BTK at Tyr551 in the activation loop, which is a prerequisite for the enzyme’s full activation; subsequently, BTK autophosphorylates at Tyr223, solidifying its active configuration. In addition to these phosphorylation events, BTK is subject to negative regulation by phosphatases such as SHP1 and the lipid phosphatase SHIP1, which dephosphorylate key residues or reduce the availability of PIP3, respectively. Beyond phosphorylation, BTK activity is modulated through conformational shifts within its kinase domain, including movements of the αC-helix and repositioning of the activation loop—mechanisms that have been elucidated through crystallographic studies. These regulatory modifications are crucial to ensuring that BTK activation is tightly coupled to receptor engagement, thereby preventing aberrant signal transduction (alu2022btkinhibitorsin pages 3-5, satterthwaite1998btkfunctionin pages 1-2, mao2001crystalstructureof pages 5-5, mcdonald2021theroleof pages 2-5).\n\n7. Function  \nBTK plays a pivotal role in mediating both adaptive and innate immune responses. It is indispensable for normal B-cell development, differentiation, and signaling. Upon antigen binding to the B-cell receptor, BTK becomes activated and phosphorylates substrates such as PLCγ2, which in turn leads to the generation of second messengers that trigger calcium mobilization and activation of downstream kinases including members of the PKC family. In addition to its well-known role in BCR signaling, BTK also functions in Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways—particularly TLR8 and TLR9—to induce the activity of transcription factors such as NF-κB, which controls the expression of numerous genes involved in inflammation and cell survival. BTK additionally phosphorylates adapter proteins like TIRAP, thereby modulating the TLR pathway and facilitating processes such as the degradation of TIRAP. Further extending its functional repertoire, BTK is involved in transcriptional regulation through the transient phosphorylation of factors like GTF2I, which then translocate to the nucleus to influence gene expression. BTK also serves as an activator of the NLRP3 inflammasome by mediating the phosphorylation of NLRP3, thereby linking its activity to innate immune responses and cytokine production. Moreover, BTK plays a dual role in the regulation of apoptosis, acting as both a promoter and inhibitor of cell death under different circumstances. Expression of BTK is primarily restricted to hematopoietic cells such as B lymphocytes, but it is also present in other cell types including macrophages, neutrophils, mast cells, and certain myeloid cells, highlighting its multifaceted role in both innate and adaptive immunity (alu2022btkinhibitorsin pages 1-3, burger2019brutontyrosinekinase pages 1-3, mcdonald2021theroleof pages 25-28, qiu2000signalingnetworkof pages 1-2).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nBTK is a well‐validated therapeutic target in a range of conditions. Inhibition of BTK has revolutionized the treatment of B-cell malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia, and marginal zone lymphoma. First-generation inhibitors like ibrutinib covalently bind to Cys481 in the kinase domain, thereby irreversibly inhibiting enzyme activity; however, resistance mutations—most notably the substitution of Cys481 with serine—can reduce inhibitor efficacy. Second-generation inhibitors such as acalabrutinib and zanubrutinib have been developed with improved selectivity and safety profiles to address these resistance mechanisms. Beyond cancer, BTK inhibitors are also under investigation for their potential in autoimmune diseases and inflammatory disorders, as BTK plays a central role in TLR-mediated cytokine production and inflammasome activation. Disease-associated mutations in BTK are responsible for X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), a condition characterized by defective B-cell maturation and severe immunodeficiency. Additionally, BTK is involved in the regulation of transcription factors such as NF-κB, ARID3A, and NFAT, contributing to its role in cell survival and apoptosis. Notable inhibitors include ibrutinib, acalabrutinib, zanubrutinib, tirabrutinib, and third-generation reversible inhibitors like pirtobrutinib, all of which target BTK’s catalytic function through covalent or noncovalent mechanisms (alu2022btkinhibitorsin pages 25-26, burger2019brutontyrosinekinase pages 1-3, tasso2021thedevelopmentof pages 26-28, vargas2013inhibitorsofbtk pages 1-3, xing2014brutonstkinhibitors pages 1-2).\n\n9.

Regulates the development, function and differentiation of conventional T-cells and nonconventional NKT-cells. When antigen presenting cells (APC) activate T-cell receptor (TCR), a series of phosphorylation lead to the recruitment of ITK to the cell membrane, in the vicinity of the stimulated TCR receptor, where it is phosphorylated by LCK. Phosphorylation leads to ITK autophosphorylation and full activation. Once activated, phosphorylates PLCG1, leading to the activation of this lipase and subsequent cleavage of its substrates. In turn, the endoplasmic reticulum releases calcium in the cytoplasm and the nuclear activator of activated T-cells (NFAT) translocates into the nucleus to perform its transcriptional duty. Phosphorylates 2 essential adapter proteins: the linker for activation of T-cells/LAT protein and LCP2. Then, a large number of signaling molecules such as VAV1 are recruited and ultimately lead to lymphokine production, T-cell proliferation and differentiation (PubMed:12186560, PubMed:12682224, PubMed:21725281). Required for TCR-mediated calcium response in gamma-delta T-cells, may also be involved in the modulation of the transcriptomic signature in the Vgamma2-positive subset of immature gamma-delta T-cells (By similarity). Phosphorylates TBX21 at 'Tyr-530' and mediates its interaction with GATA3 (By similarity)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‑protein kinase ITK (also known as ITK/TSK, EMT, Lyk) is a member of the Tec family of non‑receptor tyrosine kinases, a group that is evolutionarily distinct from the Src family of kinases. ITK is predominantly expressed in T lymphocytes and closely related to other Tec kinases such as Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), Tec, Rlk (TXK) and BMX. ITK has been identified in a wide range of vertebrates, and its conservation among mammals indicates that its gene originated early in vertebrate evolution, aligning with the evolutionary core set of kinases observed in eukaryotic organisms (ortutay2008phylogenyoftec pages 7-10, yu2009tecfamilykinases pages 23-26). This phylogenetic context places ITK within a family of kinases that share a characteristic domain architecture (including pleckstrin homology [PH], Tec homology [TH], Src homology 3 [SH3], Src homology 2 [SH2], and a kinase catalytic domain), which distinguishes it from other kinase families in the human kinome (boucheron2012theroleof pages 1-3, tarafdar2014interactionsofthe pages 82-87).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nITK catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to a tyrosine residue on substrate proteins, thereby converting ATP into ADP and generating a phospho‐tyrosine on its target substrate. In the context of T‑cell receptor (TCR) signaling, one well‑characterized substrate is phospholipase C‑γ1 (PLCγ1); phosphorylation of PLCγ1 initiates a cascade that results in the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5‑bisphosphate (PIP2) into inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) (aryal2021molecularmechanismof pages 101-104, zhong2014targetinginterleukin2inducibletcell pages 5-6).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of ITK is dependent on the presence of divalent cations, with Mg²⁺ functioning as the essential cofactor for the proper binding of ATP and subsequent phosphoryl-transfer reactions. This requirement for Mg²⁺ aligns with the common cofactor dependency observed across protein kinases (kaur2012inhibitorsofinterleukin2 pages 1-2, yu2009tecfamilykinases pages 50-52).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nITK displays substrate specificity that is consistent with its role in T‑cell receptor signaling. It primarily phosphorylates tyrosine residues on specific substrates involved in immune signaling; among these, PLCγ1 is a principal substrate, with phosphorylation events occurring on key tyrosine sites that are critical for the initiation of calcium flux and downstream signaling cascades (aryal2021molecularmechanismof pages 101-104, zhong2014targetinginterleukin2inducibletcell pages 5-6). Additionally, ITK phosphorylates adaptor proteins such as LAT and LCP2, which are necessary for the assembly of multiprotein signaling complexes following TCR engagement (boucheron2012theroleof pages 4-6, kaur2012inhibitorsofinterleukin2 pages 15-15). Although a detailed consensus motif for ITK substrates has not been explicitly defined in the available literature, the enzyme’s function is closely tied to the selective phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on proteins that orchestrate adaptive immune responses (zhong2014targetinginterleukin2inducibletcell pages 9-11).\n\n5. Structure  \nITK comprises a multi‑domain architecture that underpins both its catalytic functions and its regulatory interactions. The N‑terminal region includes a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which mediates binding to phosphoinositides such as phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5‑trisphosphate (PIP3) and facilitates membrane recruitment—a step that is indispensable for its activation (boucheron2012theroleof pages 1-3, kaur2012inhibitorsofinterleukin2 pages 4-5). Adjacent to the PH domain is the Tec homology (TH) domain that contains a BTK‑type zinc finger motif and a proline‑rich region (PRR). The PRR is functionally significant as it participates in intramolecular interactions that help maintain ITK in an autoinhibited conformation and modulate its activation upon TCR stimulation (aryal2021molecularmechanismof pages 96-101, gurung2023prolineisomerizationfrom pages 9-11). Following the TH domain, ITK harbors an SH3 domain that binds to polyproline motifs and plays a critical role in protein–protein interactions. Notably, a conserved tyrosine residue (Y180) within the SH3 domain is subject to autophosphorylation, which influences ligand binding and kinase activation (aryal2021molecularmechanismof pages 92-96). The SH2 domain, capable of binding phosphotyrosine‑containing motifs in target proteins, exhibits conformational plasticity due to a proline‐dependent cis–trans isomerization event that further regulates ITK activity (aryal2021molecularmechanismof pages 101-104, gurung2023prolineisomerizationfrom pages 9-11). Finally, the C‑terminal kinase domain (SH1) contains the canonical ATP‑binding site and catalytic loop necessary for phosphotransfer activity, with key structural elements such as the activation loop and the C‑helix playing roles in substrate engagement and catalytic efficiency (zhong2014targetinginterleukin2inducibletcell pages 11-13, kaur2012inhibitorsofinterleukin2 pages 15-15). This arrangement of domains—PH, TH, SH3, SH2, and kinase—ensures that ITK is tightly regulated both spatially and temporally within the T cell (boucheron2012theroleof pages 17-19, aryal2021molecularmechanismof pages 96-101).\n\n6. Regulation  \nITK is subject to complex regulatory mechanisms that involve both post‑translational modifications and dynamic intramolecular interactions. A key regulatory event occurs upon T‑cell receptor engagement when the Src family kinase Lck phosphorylates ITK at a critical tyrosine residue (Y511) in the activation loop; this phosphorylation event primes ITK for full activation through subsequent autophosphorylation events, including on the SH3 domain at Y180 (zhong2014targetinginterleukin2inducibletcell pages 11-13, aryal2021molecularmechanismof pages 92-96). The autoinhibited state of ITK is maintained by intramolecular interactions between its regulatory domains, such as the binding of the proline-rich region of the TH domain to the SH3 domain; disruption of these interactions, for example through binding of phosphoinositides to the PH domain, results in a conformational shift that releases the kinase domain for catalytic action (aryal2021molecularmechanismof pages 104-109, kaur2012inhibitorsofinterleukin2 pages 14-14). In addition, proline isomerization within the SH2 domain—specifically at residues adjacent to the phosphotyrosine binding pocket—has been shown to modulate ITK’s ligand-binding specificity and thereby impact its downstream signaling functions (gurung2023prolineisomerizationfrom pages 9-11). ITK regulation is also influenced by its interactions with adaptor proteins such as SLP‑76 and LAT, which act as scaffolds to assemble the signaling complex required for full T‑cell activation (boucheron2012theroleof pages 4-6, tarafdar2014interactionsofthe pages 82-87). These regulatory events ensure that ITK activity is tightly coupled to T‑cell receptor stimulation, preventing premature or inappropriate signaling (zhong2014targetinginterleukin2inducibletcell pages 6-8, boucheron2012theroleof pages 8-9).\n\n7. Function  \nITK plays an essential role in the regulation of adaptive immunity. It is highly expressed in conventional T‑cells as well as in non‑conventional natural killer T‑cells (NKT cells), where it is critical for T‑cell receptor (TCR) signaling. Upon antigen recognition by the TCR, a cascade of phosphorylation events leads to the recruitment of ITK to the plasma membrane, where Lck phosphorylates ITK to initiate its activation. Once activated, ITK phosphorylates several key substrates, including phospholipase C‑γ1 (PLCγ1), which in turn catalyzes the formation of second messengers IP3 and DAG, leading to calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum and the activation of transcription factors such as NFAT that are essential for lymphokine production, T‑cell proliferation, and differentiation (aryal2021molecularmechanismof pages 101-104, zhong2014targetinginterleukin2inducibletcell pages 1-3). In addition, ITK phosphorylates adaptor proteins such as LAT and LCP2 (SLP‑76), which are required for the formation and stabilization of the TCR signalosome that orchestrates downstream signaling pathways (boucheron2012theroleof pages 4-6, kaur2012inhibitorsofinterleukin2 pages 15-15). ITK is also involved in the modulation of transcriptional regulators; for example, by phosphorylating TBX21 (T‑bet) at Tyr‑530, ITK mediates interactions that influence the balance between T‑helper cell subsets, particularly affecting Th2 differentiation and the expression of cytokines such as interleukin‑2 (IL‑2) (aryal2021molecularmechanismof pages 237-240, boucheron2012theroleof pages 9-11). Beyond its role in classical T‑cell signaling, ITK is essential for TCR‑mediated calcium responses in γδ T‑cells and contributes to the transcriptomic landscape of immature γδ T‑cells, further underpinning its importance in immune regulation (blomberg2009geneexpressionanalysis pages 21-25, lechner2020roleofthe pages 1-2). Collectively, ITK functions as a critical link between antigen recognition and a diverse array of intracellular signaling events that govern T‑cell activation, differentiation, and effector functions in adaptive immunity (kaur2012inhibitorsofinterleukin2 pages 2-3, boucheron2012theroleof pages 17-19).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral small molecule inhibitors targeting ITK have been identified and characterized, reflecting its potential as a therapeutic target for T‑cell mediated inflammatory disorders. Among these inhibitors are classes of compounds such as benzimidazole derivatives, aminothiazoles, thiazolyl compounds, and dual inhibitors that also target kinases like RLK and PI3K (kaur2012inhibitorsofinterleukin2 pages 13-14, zhong2014targetinginterleukin2inducibletcell pages 5-6). In addition, experimental compounds like rosmarinic acid have been reported to attenuate T‑cell receptor-induced T‑cell activation in an Lck‑dependent manner, further underscoring the therapeutic promise of modulating ITK activity (kaur2012inhibitorsofinterleukin2 pages 12-13). Disease associations implicate ITK in a range of immune‑related conditions, including allergic asthma, atopic dermatitis, and certain T‑cell lymphomas; loss‑of‑function mutations or dysregulated ITK signaling have been linked to immunodeficiencies and aberrant lymphoproliferative disorders, such as fatal Epstein‑Barr virus‑associated lymphoproliferation (aryal2021molecularmechanismof pages 234-237, boucheron2012theroleof pages 16-17). Notably, oncogenic fusion proteins involving ITK, such as ITK‑SYK, have been identified in peripheral T‑cell lymphomas, highlighting a role for ITK in oncogenic signaling pathways (boucheron2012theroleof pages 15-16, zhong2014targetinginterleukin2inducibletcell pages 9-11). These observations have spurred significant interest in the development of ITK inhibitors as clinical candidates; however, despite promising preclinical data, issues such as pharmacokinetic limitations and specificity challenges remain (kaur2012inhibitorsofinterleukin2 pages 14-14, zhong2014targetinginterleukin2inducibletcell pages 8-9).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase Tec is a non‐receptor tyrosine kinase that belongs to the Tec family, a subgroup within the wider tyrosine kinase branch of the human kinome. Tec and its close relatives—including Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) and interleukin‐2–inducible T-cell kinase (ITK)—are evolutionarily related and share a common ancestry with other cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases that emerged early in the evolution of metazoans (kwon2019tracingtheevolution pages 32-37). Orthologs of Tec have been identified in all mammalian species, indicating its conservation across vertebrates, and the enzyme shares significant sequence homology and domain organization with other members of the Tec family. In phylogenetic analyses based on sequence motifs and domain composition, Tec is placed within the Src module subgroup, which is characterized by the presence of SH3–SH2–kinase domain arrangements as well as additional regulatory regions that enable fine-tuning of its catalytic function (marcotte2010structuresofhuman pages 1-3, kwon2019tracingtheevolution pages 32-37).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nTec catalyzes the transfer of the γ-phosphate group from ATP to specific tyrosine residues on protein substrates. The overall chemical reaction can be summarized as follows:  \n ATP + protein–tyrosine → ADP + protein–phosphotyrosine + H⁺  \nThis reaction is fundamental to tyrosine phosphorylation and is central to signal transduction processes mediated by Tec (banerjee2013phosphorylationubiquitylationand pages 20-26).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of Tec, like that of most protein kinases, depends on the presence of divalent metal ions. In particular, Mg²⁺ is required to coordinate ATP binding at the active site and to facilitate the phosphate transfer reaction. This cofactor is essential for proper alignment of ATP and the substrate, stabilizing transition states during catalysis (banerjee2013phosphorylationubiquitylationand pages 20-26).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nThe substrate specificity of Tec is determined by its ability to recognize tyrosine residues within specific sequence contexts and by its associated phosphotyrosine-binding domains. Tec phosphorylates substrates that display particular amino acid motifs surrounding the target tyrosine residue. For example, Tec has been shown to phosphorylate proteins such as DOK1 and STAP1, where recognition typically involves a phosphorylated tyrosine residue flanked by hydrophobic or other selectively favored amino acids at positions immediately following the phosphorylation site (for instance, positions +1 to +3) (diop2022sh2domainsfolding pages 6-8, cesareni2005modularproteindomains pages 31-33). Although detailed consensus motifs specific to Tec have not been explicitly delineated in the available literature, its substrate specificity is in line with general features observed for tyrosine kinases that utilize their SH2 domains to mediate selective interactions with phosphopeptides.\n\n5. Structure  \nTec is composed of multiple domains arranged in a modular format that is characteristic of the Tec family kinases. At its N-terminus, Tec contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which is pivotal for binding phosphoinositides such as PIP3 and thereby mediating membrane localization. Adjacent to the PH domain is the Tec homology (TH) region, which includes motifs such as a Btk homology domain and proline-rich regions that participate in protein–protein interactions. This is followed by an SH3 domain that binds proline-rich sequences, an SH2 domain that engages phosphotyrosine-containing motifs, and finally the C-terminal kinase catalytic domain (also known as the SH1 domain) which carries out the phosphorylation reaction (marcotte2010structuresofhuman pages 1-3, kwon2019tracingtheevolution pages 32-37).  \n\nWithin the kinase catalytic domain, Tec displays a bilobal structure composed of a smaller N-terminal lobe enriched with β-sheets and a larger C-terminal lobe predominantly formed by α-helices. Key structural features include a glycine-rich loop involved in ATP binding, a conserved lysine in the β3 strand that interacts with ATP, an activation loop whose conformation regulates access to the active site, and a C-helix that plays a crucial role in aligning catalytic residues. Moreover, Tec’s catalytic domain encompasses a hydrophobic regulatory spine (R-spine), the assembly of which is critical for its transition from inactive to active conformations (kwon2019tracingtheevolution pages 32-37, mcclendon2020structurefunctionand pages 1-3). Experimental models and predicted three-dimensional structures suggest that Tec shares this canonical kinase fold with minor family-specific insertions that may contribute to its unique regulatory properties.\n\n6. Regulation  \nTec kinase activity is tightly controlled by several regulatory mechanisms that include post-translational modifications as well as intramolecular and intermolecular protein interactions. One pivotal mode of regulation is through phosphorylation at key tyrosine residues in the activation loop of the kinase domain. Phosphorylation events serve to disrupt autoinhibitory conformations and promote alignment of the catalytic machinery for effective ATP binding and substrate phosphorylation. In addition, reciprocal phosphorylation with kinases such as JAK2 is known to modulate downstream transcriptional pathways—for instance, the activation of FOS transcription—thereby integrating Tec activity within broader cytokine-driven signaling cascades (naylor2021brutonstyrosinekinase pages 173-176, zarrin2021kinaseinhibitionin pages 12-13).  \n\nBesides autophosphorylation, Tec is regulated by its membrane recruitment via the PH domain. Upon binding to specific phospholipids at the plasma membrane, Tec is brought into close proximity with substrates and other signaling partners, which facilitates its activation in response to receptor engagement. Interactions mediated by the SH3 and SH2 domains further modulate Tec activity by promoting substrate association and stabilizing distinct conformational states. These domain interactions may also participate in negative regulation by maintaining Tec in a closed, autoinhibited conformation until cellular signals trigger a conformational shift that exposes the catalytic domain (kwon2019tracingtheevolution pages 41-45, ji2015widescalequantitativephosphoproteomic pages 10-11).\n\n7. Function  \nTec plays a multifaceted role in signal transduction pathways across various cell types, with a particularly prominent role in the adaptive immune response. In T lymphocytes, Tec is required for T cell receptor (TCR)–dependent interleukin-2 (IL2) gene induction and thus contributes to conventional T cell development, differentiation, and function. Tec’s activity in T cells also extends to the regulation of nonconventional natural killer T (NKT) cells (Information section). In B cells, Tec functions redundantly with BTK to mediate B cell receptor (BCR) signaling that is critical for B cell development and activation, including the phosphorylation of substrates such as STAP1 (Information section, naylor2021brutonstyrosinekinase pages 49-52).  \n\nIn mast cells, Tec is required for efficient cytokine production following activation, further demonstrating its role in immune cell function. Beyond lymphocytes and mast cells, Tec participates in signaling downstream of receptors in myeloid cells; for example, it is activated by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (CSF3) and contributes to myeloid cell growth, differentiation, and functional activation. Additionally, Tec is involved in platelet signaling downstream of integrin activation, where it modulates pathways essential for platelet aggregation and secretion. In hepatocytes, Tec plays a part in hepatocyte proliferation and liver regeneration by engaging in the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)–induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway and is also implicated in the regulation of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) secretion through a noncanonical mechanism that bypasses the classical endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi route (Information section, castelosoccio2023proteinkinasesdrug pages 1-2).  \n\nTec further mediates cross-talk between distinct signaling cascades by phosphorylating substrates involved in both growth and differentiation. For instance, Tec phosphorylates DOK1 and the adaptor protein GRB10, which are implicated in CD28 and cytokine receptor signaling pathways, respectively. This interconnected role positions Tec as an important signal transducer whose activity influences cell proliferation, immune cell activation, and even osteoclast differentiation in bone biology (Information section, zarrin2021kinaseinhibitionin pages 12-13).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral small-molecule inhibitors developed primarily for other Tec family kinases, such as BTK inhibitors ibrutinib and acalabrutinib, also inhibit Tec due to overlapping active site features and sequence homology within the Tec family. These inhibitors have been reported to impact platelet activation as well as immune cell function, highlighting the clinical relevance of targeting Tec in diseases where its activity is dysregulated (naylor2021brutonstyrosinekinase pages 173-176, zarrin2021kinaseinhibitionin pages 12-13).  \n\nIn terms of disease association, aberrant Tec signaling has been implicated in various immune disorders including immunodeficiencies, given its redundant role with ITK in regulating adaptive immunity, and in hematologic malignancies where dysregulation of BCR or TCR signaling may contribute to oncogenesis. Moreover, Tec’s involvement in integrin-mediated platelet activation and hepatocyte proliferation also suggests potential roles in conditions such as thrombosis and liver regeneration. Notable disease mutations have not been exhaustively characterized in the available literature; however, alterations that affect Tec’s kinase activity or regulatory interactions could conceivably result in impaired immune function or aberrant cellular growth.  \n\nAdditional studies employing kinome array profiling have identified Tec activity alterations in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, where differential kinase activity profiles suggest its involvement in the complex signaling networks that underlie oncogenesis and desmoplastic stromal development (creeden2020kinomearrayprofiling pages 16-18, creeden2020kinomearrayprofiling pages 28-30).  \n \n9.

Regulates the development, function and differentiation of conventional T-cells and nonconventional NKT-cells. When antigen presenting cells (APC) activate T-cell receptor (TCR), a series of phosphorylation leads to the recruitment of TXK to the cell membrane, where it is phosphorylated at Tyr-420. Phosphorylation leads to TXK full activation. Also contributes to signaling from many receptors and participates in multiple downstream pathways, including regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Like ITK, can phosphorylate PLCG1, leading to its localization in lipid rafts and activation, followed by subsequent cleavage of its substrates. In turn, the endoplasmic reticulum releases calcium in the cytoplasm and the nuclear activator of activated T-cells (NFAT) translocates into the nucleus to perform its transcriptional duty. Plays a role in the positive regulation of IFNG transcription in T-helper 1 cells as part of an IFNG promoter-binding complex with PARP1 and EEF1A1 (PubMed:11859127, PubMed:17177976). Within the complex, phosphorylates both PARP1 and EEF1A1 (PubMed:17177976). Also phosphorylates key sites in LCP2 leading to the up-regulation of Th1 preferred cytokine IL-2. Phosphorylates 'Tyr-201' of CTLA4 which leads to the association of PI-3 kinase with the CTLA4 receptor**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase TXK (also known as PTK4 or RLK) is a member of the Tec family of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases that are predominantly expressed in lymphocytes. TXK is evolutionarily related to other Tec kinases such as ITK, Btk, Tec, and Bmx, and orthologs have been identified across mammalian species, consistent with an origin that traces back to common progenitors of the Tec kinase family (berg2005tecfamilykinases pages 1-3, ortutay2008phylogenyoftec pages 4-7). The placement of TXK within the Tec family aligns it within a conserved group of kinases essential for immune cell signaling and is supported by phylogenetic analyses that demonstrate its high sequence homology with other members in chordates (ortutay2008phylogenyoftec pages 7-10).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nTXK catalyzes the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on protein substrates by transferring a phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of a tyrosine residue. The chemical reaction can be depicted as: ATP + [protein]-L-tyrosine → ADP + [protein]-L-tyrosine-phosphate + H⁺ (berg2005tecfamilykinases pages 17-18).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of TXK is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions, with Mg²⁺ serving as an essential cofactor for the proper orientation of ATP within the active site (berg2005tecfamilykinases pages 17-18).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nTXK displays substrate specificity through recognition of target motifs typically present in proteins involved in T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling. Notable substrates include phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCG1), CTLA4, LCP2, PARP1, and EEF1A1. TXK employs its SH2 and SH3 domains to engage in protein-protein interactions that facilitate the phosphorylation of these substrates, leading to downstream events such as the localization of PLCG1 in lipid rafts and the subsequent generation of second messengers (berg2005tecfamilykinases pages 3-6, yu2009tecfamilykinases pages 12-16, yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 16-16).\n\n5. Structure  \nTXK is organized into modular domains typical of Tec family kinases. Its C-terminal kinase domain adopts the canonical bilobed structure seen in protein kinases, including key elements such as the activation loop (with Tyr420 serving as a critical phosphorylation site for full activation), the C-helix, and the hydrophobic spines that are essential for catalytic activity (berg2005tecfamilykinases pages 6-8, bradshaw2010thesrcsyk pages 5-6). Unlike several other Tec kinases that contain an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain for phosphoinositide binding, TXK generally lacks this domain. Instead, TXK features a cysteine-string motif at the amino terminus that can undergo palmitoylation, thereby mediating its membrane localization and influencing spatial regulation within T cells (ortutay2008phylogenyoftec pages 4-7, yu2009tecfamilykinases pages 16-19). In addition, TXK contains well-conserved SH3 and SH2 domains that are implicated in mediating protein-protein interactions with proline-rich regions and phosphotyrosine-containing motifs, respectively, which are critical for substrate recruitment and regulatory complex formation (berg2005tecfamilykinases pages 8-11).\n\n6. Regulation  \nTXK is regulated primarily by phosphorylation events that modulate its catalytic activity and subcellular localization. Membrane-proximal signaling events initiated by T-cell receptor activation lead to the recruitment of TXK to the plasma membrane where Src family kinases, such as Lck or Fyn, phosphorylate TXK at Tyr420, a modification that is necessary for full enzymatic activation (berg2005tecfamilykinases pages 17-18, berg2005tecfamilykinases pages 28-30). In addition, TXK phosphorylates downstream effectors including PLCG1, PARP1, and EEF1A1; within a defined complex, phosphorylation of these targets modulates processes such as actin cytoskeleton reorganization and NFAT-dependent transcription. TXK regulation is further influenced by dynamic protein-protein interactions mediated by its SH2 and SH3 domains and by potential alternative splicing isoforms that affect its subcellular distribution between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (venegas…2009teckinasesregulate pages 1-2, berg2005tecfamilykinases pages 8-11).\n\n7. Function  \nTXK plays a central role in mediating adaptive immune responses by regulating the development, activation, and differentiation of conventional T-cells as well as nonconventional NKT cells. Upon antigen presentation, engagement of the T-cell receptor triggers a cascade of phosphorylation events that leads to the recruitment of TXK to the cell membrane. Activated TXK phosphorylates PLCG1, promoting its translocation into lipid rafts, where it catalyzes the cleavage of its substrates, eventually leading to release of intracellular calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequent nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) (berg2005tecfamilykinases pages 39-41, berg2005tecfamilykinases pages 17-18). In addition, TXK contributes to the positive regulation of IFNG transcription in T-helper 1 (Th1) cells by forming a complex with PARP1 and EEF1A1 and phosphorylating both components, thereby enhancing IFNG promoter activity (berg2005tecfamilykinases pages 39-41, suzuki2006skewedth1responses pages 5-5). TXK also phosphorylates LCP2, which is involved in the up-regulation of the Th1-preferred cytokine IL-2, and phosphorylates Tyr-201 of CTLA4, a modification that facilitates PI-3 kinase association with the CTLA4 receptor, further influencing T-cell co-stimulatory signaling (berg2005tecfamilykinases pages 39-41, venegas…2009teckinasesregulate pages 5-7).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nTXK has been implicated in immunological disease processes through genetic and pharmacological studies. Although specific disease-causing mutations in TXK have not been extensively documented, its functional redundancy with ITK is evidenced by the exacerbated defects observed in double knockout mouse models. Furthermore, genetic association studies and Open Targets data have linked TXK to platelet-related phenotypes and autoimmune diseases, including vitiligo and alopecia areata (OpenTargets Search). Clinically, TXK is considered a candidate target for therapeutic intervention, as exemplified by the small-molecule inhibitor ritlecitinib tosylate, which targets multiple Tec family kinases including TXK (castelosoccio2023proteinkinasesdrug pages 15-16, bradshaw2010thesrcsyk pages 3-5). TXK also shares a conserved cysteine residue in the kinase domain that is exploited by covalent inhibitors developed for related kinases, further supporting its potential for drug targeting (schnute2012brutonstyrosinekinase pages 18-20).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase FRK, also known as PTK5 or RAK, is a non‐receptor tyrosine kinase that belongs to a distinct subgroup within the Src-related kinase family. FRK clusters with other kinases of the BRK family (also referred to as breast tumor kinase family kinases) and shares structural and evolutionary features with related kinases such as BRK (PTK6) and SRMS. FRK is encoded by a gene located on human chromosome 6q21–q22.3, a genomic region with a documented loss of heterozygosity in various human tumors. Comparative sequence analysis across species suggests that FRK orthologs are broadly conserved in vertebrates, indicating evolutionary selection for its regulatory functions. Its domain architecture, characterized by conserved Src homology domains (SH2 and SH3) and a catalytic kinase domain, aligns it with the overall organization of the Src family; however, FRK is phylogenetically distinct because it lacks classical membrane-targeting signals such as N-terminal myristoylation and palmitoylation. (macausland2019frkcancerrelatedmutations pages 1-6, kwon2019tracingtheevolution pages 55-60)\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nFRK catalyzes the transfer of the γ-phosphate from ATP to the hydroxyl group of tyrosine residues on substrate proteins. In the canonical reaction, ATP and a protein substrate containing a tyrosine residue are converted to ADP and a phosphorylated protein (protein–tyrosine-phosphate), with the concomitant release of a proton. This reaction is representative of the typical tyrosine kinase activity observed across the kinome. (chiarugi2007proteintyrosinephosphorylation pages 1-3, cornea2022theroleof pages 34-37)\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nLike other protein tyrosine kinases, FRK requires divalent metal ions for its catalytic activity. It utilizes ATP as a phosphate donor, and its activity is dependent on the presence of Mg²⁺, which serves to coordinate the phosphates of ATP within the active site. (santos2013understandingtheenzymeinhibitor pages 20-25, chiarugi2007proteintyrosinephosphorylation pages 1-3)\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nFRK displays substrate specificity that is common among Src family-related tyrosine kinases. It phosphorylates protein substrates on tyrosine residues and shows a defined consensus substrate preference that can be deduced from peptide motif studies. A well-characterized substrate of FRK is the tumor suppressor PTEN; FRK phosphorylates PTEN specifically on Tyr-336, a modification that enhances PTEN’s stability by reducing its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. This event is critical for maintaining proper levels of PTEN in the cell and underlies FRK’s tumor suppressor function. In addition, FRK has been reported to target other substrates including key residues on the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and BRCA1, thus modulating signaling pathways associated with cell proliferation and survival. Structural studies have revealed that the SH2 domain of FRK recognizes phosphotyrosine-containing motifs, with peptides such as HFpYENI identified as preferred binding sequences. (cornea2022theroleof pages 34-37, macausland2019frkcancerrelatedmutations pages 26-29, cornea2022theroleof pages 37-42)\n\n5. Structure  \nFRK is a 505 amino acid protein that exhibits a modular domain organization typical of Src-related non-receptor tyrosine kinases. Its overall structure comprises an N-terminal region followed by conserved SH3 and SH2 domains and a central catalytic (kinase) domain. The kinase domain itself exhibits a bilobed structure: an N-terminal lobe composed primarily of β-sheets and a C-terminal lobe rich in α-helices. Key catalytic features include an ATP-binding site, coordinated primarily by residues in the N-terminal lobe, and a glycine-rich P-loop that facilitates nucleotide binding. Two critical tyrosine residues, Tyr-387 and Tyr-497, serve as the activating and inhibitory sites, respectively. Phosphorylation of Tyr-387 (the autophosphorylation site) promotes a conformational rearrangement that leads to kinase activation, whereas Tyr-497, located in the C-terminal tail, is implicated in autoinhibitory interactions that restrict substrate access. Notably, FRK’s SH2 domain harbors a nuclear localization sequence (NLS), which distinguishes it from many other Src family kinases that are predominantly membrane-associated; this NLS drives nuclear accumulation under certain regulatory conditions. Furthermore, the absence of N-terminal myristoylation and palmitoylation signals in FRK contributes to its soluble character and broader intracellular localization. Structural modeling and experimental studies have confirmed that the overall 3D fold of FRK’s kinase domain is conserved with typical non-receptor tyrosine kinases, yet its unique features—in particular, the embedded NLS within the SH2 domain—provide distinct regulatory capabilities. (cornea2022theroleof pages 34-37, macausland2019frkcancerrelatedmutations pages 22-26, mcclendon2020structurefunctionand pages 1-3)\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe activity of FRK is tightly regulated through multiple post-translational mechanisms. Autophosphorylation of Tyr-387 is essential for full kinase activity, while phosphorylation at Tyr-497 exerts inhibitory control by promoting an intramolecular conformation that limits substrate interaction. The balance between these phosphorylated states determines the catalytic activity of FRK in the cell. In addition to autophosphorylation, FRK-mediated regulation involves domain–domain interactions, particularly via its SH2 and SH3 domains, which participate in both intra- and intermolecular contacts. These domains facilitate interactions with substrates and regulatory proteins that can either enhance or dampen its activity. Experimentally documented cancer-associated mutations, such as R64P, K265R, N359I, and a deletion mutation designated as VF, have been shown to alter FRK’s kinase activity and downstream signaling outputs. For instance, alterations in the kinase domain or in the conserved motifs can compromise ATP binding or disrupt the autoinhibitory mechanism, leading to changes in the phosphorylation levels of downstream targets like STAT3, AKT, and components of the JNK/c-Jun pathway. These regulatory mechanisms collectively underscore the role of FRK as an enzyme whose activity is modulated by precise phosphorylation events and by its ability to interact with key signaling proteins. (cornea2022theroleof pages 34-37, macausland2019frkcancerrelatedmutations pages 73-77, corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 146-149)\n\n7. Function  \nFRK functions primarily as a negative regulator of cell proliferation. A critical aspect of its tumor-suppressive role is its capacity to phosphorylate and stabilize the tumor suppressor PTEN by specifically modifying Tyr-336; this phosphorylation event reduces the binding of PTEN to the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4, thereby preventing its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. As a consequence, PTEN is maintained at levels that are sufficient to counteract PI3K/AKT signaling and thus inhibit uncontrolled cell growth. Beyond its effects on PTEN, FRK has been implicated in the modulation of growth factor receptor signaling pathways. For example, FRK has been shown to phosphorylate EGFR at specific tyrosine residues, influencing receptor internalization and downstream signaling cascades associated with cell survival and proliferation. Moreover, FRK’s activity contributes to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis by regulating additional substrates such as BRCA1 and proteins involved in cytoskeletal organization. Expression studies have demonstrated that FRK is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues, including breast tissue, where its loss or downregulation has been observed in some breast cancers, consistent with its role as a tumor suppressor. In certain contexts, however, FRK may display oncogenic properties, for instance in hepatocellular carcinoma where specific activating mutations have been detected. The diverse substrate repertoire and intricate regulatory interactions associated with FRK place it at a nodal point in various signaling pathways that govern cell cycle progression, differentiation, and survival. (cornea2022theroleof pages 34-37, macausland2019frkcancerrelatedmutations pages 54-61, cornea2022theroleof pages 37-42, macausland2019frkcancerrelatedmutations pages 61-68)\n\n8. Other Comments  \nAlthough there are no FRK-specific inhibitors extensively characterized to date, its regulatory tyrosine residues and unique nuclear localization signal represent potential focal points for therapeutic targeting. Cancer-associated mutations in FRK, such as R64P, K265R, N359I, and the VF deletion, have been documented and are known to variably affect its kinase activity in experimental models of breast cancer and other malignancies. Dysregulation of FRK expression and function has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a range of tumors—including breast, liver, gliomas, and malignant melanomas—indicating that FRK serves as a critical modulator of oncogenic signaling cascades. The dual role of FRK, acting as both a tumor suppressor and, in some contexts, as an oncogenic factor, underscores the complexity of its biological functions. Ongoing studies continue to explore its interaction networks, substrate specificity, and domain-dependent regulation, making FRK a protein kinase of considerable interest in cancer biology and a potential candidate for future molecular-targeted therapies.

Promotes mast cell degranulation, release of inflammatory cytokines and IgE-mediated anaphylaxis. Acts downstream of receptors that bind the Fc region of immunoglobulins, such as MS4A2/FCER1B, FCGR2A and/or FCGR2B. Acts downstream of ITGB1 and ITGB2, and regulates actin cytoskeleton reorganization, cell spreading and adhesion. Depending on the context, activates or inhibits cellular responses. Functions as a negative regulator of ITGB2 signaling, phagocytosis and SYK activity in monocytes. Required for normal ITGB1 and ITGB2 signaling, normal cell spreading and adhesion in neutrophils and macrophages. Functions as a positive regulator of cell migration and regulates cytoskeleton reorganization via RAC1 activation. Phosphorylates SYK (in vitro) and promotes SYK-dependent activation of AKT1 and MAP kinase signaling. Phosphorylates PLD2 in antigen-stimulated mast cells, leading to PLD2 activation and the production of the signaling molecules lysophosphatidic acid and diacylglycerol. Promotes activation of PIK3R1. Phosphorylates FASLG, and thereby regulates its ubiquitination and subsequent internalization. Phosphorylates ABL1. Promotes phosphorylation of CBL, CTTN, PIK3R1, PTK2/FAK1, PTK2B/PYK2 and VAV2. Phosphorylates HCLS1 that has already been phosphorylated by SYK, but not unphosphorylated HCLS1. Together with CLNK, it acts as a negative regulator of natural killer cell-activating receptors and inhibits interferon-gamma production (By similarity)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nFgr is a member of the Src family of non‐receptor protein tyrosine kinases and, like other family members such as Src, Hck, Lyn, Fyn, Yes, Lck, and Blk, its orthologs are found across mammals and other vertebrates (brickell1991thecsrcfamily pages 1-3). Within the human kinome, Fgr is classified in the Src-related group and shows an evolutionarily conserved domain organization that dates back to early eukaryotic ancestors (korademirnics2000srckinasemediatedsignaling pages 2-3, shen2018thesrcfamily pages 1-2). Its evolutionary history also reveals relationships with primordial Src kinases found in unicellular organisms, underscoring its conserved role in immune-specific signaling pathways (ciapala2017thesrcfamilykinase pages 26-30, shen2018thesrcfamily pages 7-8).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nFgr catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on protein substrates. The general reaction mechanism is:  \nATP + [protein]-L-tyrosine → ADP + [protein]-L-tyrosine-phosphate + H⁺ (shen2018thesrcfamily pages 1-2, patel1988structureandexpression pages 3-3).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of Fgr requires divalent metal ion cofactors, with Mg²⁺ serving as an essential cofactor that facilitates the transfer of the γ-phosphate group from ATP to its substrate (kemble2009abiochemicalstudy pages 18-23, patel1988structureandexpression pages 3-3).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nFgr phosphorylates tyrosine residues on target proteins that participate in immune and integrin-mediated signaling pathways. Its substrate specificity has been characterized by its ability to phosphorylate proteins such as HS1 in hematopoietic cells, with reports identifying tyrosine 222 of HS1 as a target (brunati1999molecularfeaturesunderlying pages 1-2). In addition, Fgr has been shown to phosphorylate elements of the receptor signaling apparatus, including Syk, PLD2, and components involved in actin cytoskeleton regulation (shen2018thesrcfamily pages 6-6, vines2001inhibitionofβ2 pages 1-2). Although a well-defined consensus substrate motif has not been conclusively established, its activity is largely mediated by recognition of phosphotyrosine sites on substrates involved in immune receptor complex formation (gocek2014nonreceptorproteintyrosine pages 2-3, inoue1991humancfgrinduces pages 5-6).\n\n5. Structure  \nFgr exhibits the canonical domain composition of Src family kinases. At its extreme N-terminus, it contains a myristoylation signal that mediates plasma membrane association (brickell1991thecsrcfamily pages 1-3, hatakeyama1994themurinecfgr pages 1-2). This is followed sequentially by a unique region that confers additional specificity, an SH3 domain that facilitates interactions with proline-rich sequences, and an SH2 domain that binds phosphotyrosine-containing motifs (shen2018thesrcfamily pages 1-2, giagulli2006thesrcfamily pages 1-1). Next, the catalytic SH1 (kinase) domain is present, which mediates ATP binding and phosphotransfer activity; within this domain lies the activation loop containing the critical autophosphorylation site (Tyr416 in Src numbering) (shen2018thesrcfamily pages 6-6, kemble2009abiochemicalstudy pages 38-43). A unique structural feature of Fgr is found in its activation loop, where a distinct “NPC” (Asn-Pro-Cys) motif replaces the canonical “TAR” sequence seen in other Src family kinases; this alteration appears to correlate with its relatively high basal kinase activity and its capacity to transform cells independently of classical SH3–SH2 mediated autoinhibition (shen2018thesrcfamily pages 7-8, shen2018thesrcfamily pages 3-3). Although no high-resolution crystal structure is currently available specifically for Fgr, homology models based on other Src kinases provide insight into its overall three-dimensional organization, including the positioning of the C-helix, the hydrophobic spine, and the location of key regulatory residues (loris2007exploringstructureand pages 149-152, hatakeyama1994themurinecfgr pages 3-3).\n\n6. Regulation  \nUnlike many other Src family members, Fgr’s kinase activity is manifest in a constitutively active state in certain myeloid cells, as it functions independently of the conventional SH3- and SH2-domain autoinhibitory interactions (shen2018thesrcfamily pages 2-3, shen2018thesrcfamily pages 3-3). Autophosphorylation of the activation loop tyrosine is observed, yet modifications at the C-terminal regulatory tyrosine equivalent do not further enhance its activity in the same way they do for Src or Hck (shen2018thesrcfamily pages 6-6, inoue1991humancfgrinduces pages 1-2). Fgr also undergoes redox-dependent regulation via a conserved cysteine residue located in the glycine loop; oxidation at this site can promote dimerization through disulfide bond formation, a feature conserved among Src, Yes, and Fgr (kemble2009abiochemicalstudy pages 94-100). Additionally, Fgr participates in feedback regulation within immune signaling complexes by interacting with phosphatases such as SHP-1 upon association with ITIM-bearing receptors, thereby modulating downstream substrate phosphorylation including that of Syk (gresham2000negativeregulationof pages 7-8, vines2001inhibitionofβ2 pages 12-13). These regulatory mechanisms underscore a distinct balance between activation and inhibition in Fgr that is context dependent, with differential responses observed in monocytes versus other hematopoietic cells (ciapala2017thesrcfamilykinase pages 90-93).\n\n7. Function  \nFgr is predominantly expressed in myeloid lineage cells such as neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and mast cells. Its expression profile also extends to natural killer cells and certain B-lymphocyte subsets, particularly under conditions of transformation or viral infection (hatakeyama1994themurinecfgr pages 1-2, inoue1991humancfgrinduces pages 1-2). In immune cells, Fgr transmits signals from cell surface receptors that lack intrinsic kinase activity, operating downstream of receptors such as Fc receptors (FCGR2A/FCGR2B), integrins (ITGB1 and ITGB2), and components of the mast cell receptor complex (MS4A2/FCER1B) (shen2018thesrcfamily pages 1-2, ciapala2017thesrcfamilykinase pages 90-93). Through phosphorylation of substrates like Syk, PLD2, and even components of the cytoskeleton such as HCLS1 and cortactin, Fgr modulates key cellular processes including:\n• Phagocytosis and integrin-mediated cell adhesion and spreading in monocytes and macrophages (vines2001inhibitionofβ2 pages 1-2, vines2001inhibitionofβ2 pages 9-10).  \n• Cytoskeleton remodeling and cell migration through activation of RAC1 and regulation of downstream signaling cascades like the PI3K-AKT and MAP kinase pathways (shen2018thesrcfamily pages 6-6, ciapala2017thesrcfamilykinase pages 26-30).  \n• Mast cell degranulation, which results in the release of inflammatory cytokines and contributes to IgE-mediated anaphylaxis, in part by phosphorylating PLD2 leading to the generation of lipid second messengers such as diacylglycerol and lysophosphatidic acid (shen2018thesrcfamily pages 1-2, ciapala2017thesrcfamilykinase pages 90-93).  \n• Negative regulation of ITGB2-dependent signaling in monocytes by attenuating Syk activity, which is achieved through SH2-mediated binding that inhibits further phosphorylation events (gresham2000negativeregulationof pages 7-8, vines2001inhibitionofβ2 pages 12-13).  \n• Regulation of additional proteins including FASLG, ABL1, CBL, PTK2/FAK1, and VAV2 by direct phosphorylation, thereby influencing their subsequent ubiquitination, internalization, or downstream signaling (shen2018thesrcfamily pages 1-2).  \n\n8. Other Comments  \nFgr is noted for its dual role in cellular signaling: it can act as a positive regulator in contexts that require activation of migration and cytoskeletal reorganization, and as a negative regulator that limits ITGB2-mediated adhesion and phagocytosis in monocytes (shen2018thesrcfamily pages 6-6, vines2001inhibitionofβ2 pages 9-10). This dichotomy makes Fgr a potential therapeutic target in diverse pathological conditions, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where its overexpression is associated with oncogenic transformation (shen2018thesrcfamily pages 1-2, inoue1991humancfgrinduces pages 6-6). General Src family kinase inhibitors such as dasatinib may also affect Fgr activity; however, its unique regulatory features suggest that specific inhibitors may be required to effectively modulate its function without off-target effects on other Src kinases (shen2018thesrcfamily pages 2-3, ciapala2017thesrcfamilykinase pages 90-93). No detailed mutational catalog for Fgr has been established in the context provided, and its substrate consensus motifs remain less clearly defined compared to serine/threonine kinases (brunati1999molecularfeaturesunderlying pages 1-2, gocek2014nonreceptorproteintyrosine pages 2-3).\n\n9.

Inactive FYN is phosphorylated on its C-terminal tail within the catalytic domain (PubMed:15489916). Following activation by PKA, the protein subsequently associates with PTK2/FAK1, allowing PTK2/FAK1 phosphorylation, activation and targeting to focal adhesions (PubMed:15489916). Involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and motility through phosphorylation of CTNNB1 (beta-catenin) and CTNND1 (delta-catenin) (PubMed:17194753).

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase Fyn (UniProt ID: P06241) is an evolutionarily ancient member of the Src family kinases (SFKs), a group of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases that play central roles in intracellular signaling. Its evolutionary history is deeply rooted in vertebrate biology, with orthologs identified in all mammalian species as well as in other metazoan lineages. Comparative sequence analyses demonstrate that Fyn shares a conserved modular domain organization with other SFK members such as Src, Yes, Lyn, Lck, Hck, Fgr, and Blk, along with rarer members like Yrk that have arisen by gene duplication events (brignatz2009alternativesplicingmodulates pages 1-2). The evolution of the Fyn gene has been further shaped by alternative splicing events that generate structurally and functionally distinct isoforms. In particular, the FynB isoform is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, whereas the FynT isoform is largely restricted to hematopoietic cells; these differences arise from the inclusion or exclusion of regulatory exons that encode parts of the SH2–kinase linker region, thereby influencing kinase autoinhibition and substrate interactions (brignatz2009alternativesplicingmodulates pages 7-9, demuro2021gsk3βfynand pages 4-5). Thus, Fyn is placed within a highly conserved evolutionary clade alongside other Src family kinases, with its core structure and regulatory motifs preserved from early vertebrate evolution to modern organisms (elias2015fynisan pages 13-16, liu1998engineeringsrcfamily pages 7-9).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nFyn catalyzes an ATP-dependent phosphorylation reaction that involves the transfer of the terminal γ-phosphate from ATP to a tyrosine residue on a specific substrate protein. The generalized chemical reaction can be expressed as:  \n  ATP + [protein]-tyrosine → ADP + [protein]-phosphotyrosine + H⁺  \nIn this reaction, ATP binds to the active site located within the catalytic (SH1) domain of Fyn; key residues coordinate binding of both ATP and divalent metal ions, which in turn align the γ-phosphate for nucleophilic attack by the hydroxyl group of a tyrosine residue on the substrate. This phosphorylation event introduces a negative charge at the modification site, which can alter protein conformation, subcellular localization, and intermolecular interactions; collectively, these modifications modulate downstream signaling pathways involved in processes such as cell growth, differentiation, adhesion, and motility (peng2023fynemergingbiological pages 1-3, nakamura2001activatedfynphosphorylates pages 2-3).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of Fyn is dependent on specific cofactors, particularly divalent metal ions. Mg²⁺ is a critical cofactor for Fyn’s kinase activity; magnesium ions interact with ATP’s phosphate groups, thereby stabilizing the nucleotide in the correct orientation within the active site. This coordination not only facilitates the correct positioning of ATP but also lowers the activation energy required for the phosphoryl transfer reaction, making the catalysis efficient (liu1998engineeringsrcfamily pages 7-9).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nThe substrate specificity of Fyn is determined by the interplay of its catalytic domain and its regulatory domains, including the SH2 and SH3 domains. The catalytic (SH1) domain is responsible for the chemical transfer of the phosphate group, whereas the SH2 and SH3 domains contribute to substrate recognition and docking by interacting with specific motifs on substrate proteins. The SH2 domain specifically binds phosphotyrosine-containing motifs, while the SH3 domain recognizes polyproline type II (PPII) helix-forming sequences; these interactions align substrates with the active site for efficient phosphorylation (peng2023fynemergingbiological pages 3-5, peng2023fynemergingbiological pages 5-7). Experimental mapping of phosphorylation events has revealed that Fyn preferentially targets tyrosine residues that are flanked by acidic and hydrophobic amino acids. For example, substrates involved in cell adhesion and cytoskeletal dynamics such as β-catenin (CTNNB1) and δ-catenin (CTNND1) display acidic residues upstream and hydrophobic residues immediately adjacent to the target tyrosine, thereby forming a consensus recognition environment that facilitates substrate docking and efficient catalysis (corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 94-97, schenone2011fynkinasein pages 1-2).\n\n5. Structure  \nFyn is a 59-kDa non-receptor tyrosine kinase composed of 537 amino acids, exhibiting the characteristic modular architecture of Src family kinases. Its structure is organized into several distinct domains that perform both catalytic and regulatory functions:\n • The N-terminal SH4 domain contains a myristoylation signal at glycine and additional palmitoylation sites at conserved cysteine residues. These lipid modifications are crucial for the stable membrane association of Fyn, ensuring that the kinase is correctly localized to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane where many of its substrates reside (matrone2020fyntyrosinekinase pages 12-14, liu1998engineeringsrcfamily pages 7-9).  \n • Directly following the SH4 domain is a Unique Region that exhibits significant sequence variability among SFKs. This region contributes to isoform-specific functions and regulatory interactions. Alternative splicing events within this region lead to the production of different Fyn isoforms (FynB and FynT), each with distinct cellular distributions and regulatory properties (brignatz2009alternativesplicingmodulates pages 7-9).  \n • The central SH3 domain is composed primarily of β-sheets organized into a structure that binds proline-rich motifs (PPII helices) found in various substrates and adaptor proteins. This interaction is critical for stabilizing autoinhibitory conformations in the absence of activating signals, as the SH3 domain can interact with the linker region connecting the SH2 and catalytic domains (schenone2011fynkinasein pages 1-2, peng2023fynemergingbiological pages 3-5).  \n • Following the SH3 domain is the SH2 domain, which binds to phosphotyrosine-containing motifs. This binding can occur in cis (intramolecularly) or in trans (with other proteins), serving both to recruit substrates and to stabilize the inactive conformation through binding to a phosphorylated residue in the C-terminal tail (schenone2011fynkinasein pages 1-2, peng2023fynemergingbiological pages 1-3).  \n • The C-terminal catalytic kinase domain (SH1) is organized into a bilobed structure. The smaller N-terminal lobe dominates in ATP binding, featuring a glycine-rich loop that interacts with the phosphate groups of ATP. The larger C-terminal lobe houses the catalytic machinery, including the activation loop (A-loop), a hydrophobic spine, and the critical αC-helix. The activation loop undergoes conformational shifts upon phosphorylation, which is essential for aligning the hydrophobic spine and enabling full catalytic activity. In its autoinhibited state, the phosphorylated form of the C-terminal tail (e.g., Tyr531 in FynB or Tyr528 in FynT) interacts with the SH2 domain, locking the kinase in a closed conformation that restricts substrate access (matrone2020fyntyrosinekinase pages 12-14, liu1998engineeringsrcfamily pages 7-9, schenone2011fynkinasein pages 1-2).  \nThis integrated structural organization allows Fyn to function as both a sensor and an effector in complex signaling networks through precise spatial and temporal control of its catalytic activity.\n\n6. Regulation  \nFyn’s activity is finely tuned by multiple regulatory mechanisms that include reversible post-translational modifications and conformational dynamics mediated by its modular domains. A major regulatory mechanism involves reversible phosphorylation at specific tyrosine residues:\n • In the activation loop of the catalytic domain, phosphorylation of a key tyrosine residue (Tyr420 in the FynB isoform or Tyr417 in FynT) transitions the kinase into an active conformation. This modification induces structural rearrangements in the activation loop and repositions the αC-helix, which facilitates the alignment of the hydrophobic spine necessary for full catalytic activity (nakamura2001activatedfynphosphorylates pages 2-3, peng2023fynemergingbiological pages 1-3).  \n • Conversely, phosphorylation of a conserved tyrosine residue located in the C-terminal tail (Tyr531 in FynB or Tyr528 in FynT) is essential for maintaining the autoinhibited state of Fyn. This phosphorylation event creates a binding site for the SH2 domain, which engages in an intramolecular interaction with the phosphorylated tail, thereby stabilizing an inactive conformation that prevents substrate access to the kinase active site (brignatz2009alternativesplicingmodulates pages 1-2, nakamura2001activatedfynphosphorylates pages 3-5).  \nIn addition to these phosphorylation events, alternative splicing of the fyn gene modulates regulatory properties by producing isoforms with differences in the Unique Region and the SH2–kinase linker. Such variation affects the binding affinities of the intramolecular contacts between regulatory domains and the catalytic core, and therefore influences the overall threshold for kinase activation (brignatz2009alternativesplicingmodulates pages 7-9, demuro2021gsk3βfynand pages 4-5).  \nFurthermore, the SH2 and SH3 domains participate in autoinhibitory intramolecular interactions under basal conditions. The SH3 domain commonly binds to proline-rich motifs in the linker region, while the SH2 domain generates a clamp-like association with the phosphorylated C-terminal tail. Together, these interactions create a “latch-clamp” mechanism that maintains Fyn in an inactive state until appropriate activating signals, such as those provided by binding partners or phosphorylation by upstream kinases like protein kinase A (PKA), induce conformational changes that relieve autoinhibition (peng2023fynemergingbiological pages 3-5, schenone2011fynkinasein pages 1-2, nakamura2001activatedfynphosphorylates pages 3-5).  \nThese layers of regulation ensure that Fyn’s kinase activity is context-dependent and responsive to cellular cues, thereby allowing precise modulation of downstream signaling events.\n\n7. Function  \nFyn functions as a central mediator of multiple signaling pathways that control critical cellular processes, including cell growth, survival, adhesion, migration, and differentiation. Its substrate repertoire is expansive, reflecting its roles in diverse biological contexts:\n • In cell adhesion and cytoskeletal regulation, Fyn phosphorylates key components such as β-catenin (CTNNB1) and δ-catenin (CTNND1). These post-translational modifications alter the dynamics of adherens junctions, thereby modulating cell–cell adhesion and the remodeling of the cytoskeleton necessary for cell motility and tissue architecture maintenance (peng2023fynemergingbiological pages 1-3, corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 94-97).  \n • Fyn also regulates cytoskeletal dynamics by phosphorylating actin regulators and microtubule-associated proteins, including WAS and the microtubule-associated proteins MAP2 and MAPT. Through these interactions, Fyn contributes to the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and microtubule network, processes that are essential in neuronal development and the maintenance of synaptic structures (peng2023fynemergingbiological pages 5-7).  \n • In terms of cell survival, Fyn phosphorylates survival factors such as AGAP2/PIKE-A; this modification protects cells from apoptosis by preventing the proteolytic cleavage of pro-survival proteins. Such activity is particularly relevant in conditions where cell survival is critical, as well as in certain pathological contexts like cancer (elias2015fynisan pages 13-16, peng2023fynemergingbiological pages 1-3).  \n • Within immune cell signaling, Fyn is integral to T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling. It phosphorylates downstream substrates that regulate T-cell activation, differentiation, and proliferation. Fyn also modulates negative feedback loops within TCR signaling via substrate phosphorylation of regulatory proteins, thereby fine-tuning immune responses (corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 94-97, schenone2011fynkinasein pages 1-2).  \n • In the nervous system, Fyn plays a prominent role in neuronal differentiation, axon guidance, and synaptic plasticity. It is involved in reelin-mediated signaling pathways, where it phosphorylates the adapter protein DAB1 following reelin receptor engagement, thereby influencing neuronal positioning and connectivity. Fyn’s activity in these pathways is critical for proper brain development and maintenance of neural circuits (brignatz2009alternativesplicingmodulates pages 1-2, nakamura2001activatedfynphosphorylates pages 3-5).  \n • Fyn also contributes to the maintenance of specialized structures such as the glomerular slit diaphragm in the kidney. Through phosphorylation of key proteins that comprise the slit diaphragm, Fyn plays a role in regulating the integrity of the renal filtration barrier (peng2023fynemergingbiological pages 1-3).  \nOverall, Fyn’s ability to phosphorylate a diverse array of substrate proteins positions it as an essential signaling hub that integrates inputs from multiple signaling pathways and modulates downstream responses that impact cell adhesion, cytoskeletal dynamics, immune function, neural connectivity, and survival mechanisms.\n\n8. Other Comments  \nDue to its central role in mediating intracellular signaling, dysregulation of Fyn has significant implications in human disease. Aberrant activation or overexpression of Fyn is associated with various types of cancer, where excessive kinase activity drives uncontrolled cell proliferation, enhances invasive behavior, and confers resistance to apoptosis. These oncogenic properties have been documented in studies that correlate Fyn overactivity with tumor progression in malignancies such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, and hematological cancers (elias2015fynisan pages 13-16, peng2023fynemergingbiological pages 14-14).  \nIn the realm of neurodegenerative disorders, Fyn’s involvement in neural signaling and synaptic modulation links its dysregulation to conditions such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases; disruptions in Fyn-mediated phosphorylation events can lead to aberrant synaptic function and compromised neuronal connectivity (brignatz2009alternativesplicingmodulates pages 1-2, demuro2021gsk3βfynand pages 4-5).  \nThe challenge in targeting Fyn therapeutically arises from the high degree of structural conservation within the Src family kinases, which complicates the development of selective inhibitors. Many current inhibitors that target the ATP-binding pocket of Fyn also affect related kinases, thus prompting efforts to design compounds that more specifically disrupt the protein–protein interactions mediated by the SH2 and SH3 domains or that stabilize the unique autoinhibited conformation of Fyn (schenone2011fynkinasein pages 1-2, peng2023fynemergingbiological pages 14-14).  \nIn addition to small molecule inhibitors, alternative therapeutic strategies under investigation include the use of biologics or peptides that interfere with Fyn’s domain–domain interactions to achieve a more selective suppression of its kinase activity. The expression of specific Fyn isoforms, resulting from alternative splicing events, further complicates the landscape; isoform-specific targeting may provide greater therapeutic precision, particularly when distinct isoforms are associated with particular tissue types or pathological conditions.  \nOverall, Fyn’s fundamental role in diverse signaling networks not only underscores its biological importance but also highlights its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention in cancer, neurodegeneration, and immune disorders.\n\n9.

    "answer": "Question: # Information\n\n**Protein Name: Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src / gene: SRC SRC1**\n**Uniprot Id: P12931**\n**Protein alternative names: Proto-oncogene c-Src; pp60c-src**\n**Protein Function: Non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase which is activated following engagement of many different classes of cellular receptors including immune response receptors, integrins and other adhesion receptors, receptor protein tyrosine kinases, G protein-coupled receptors as well as cytokine receptors (PubMed:34234773). Participates in signaling pathways that control a diverse spectrum of biological activities including gene transcription, immune response, cell adhesion, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, migration, and transformation. Due to functional redundancy between members of the SRC kinase family, identification of the specific role of each SRC kinase is very difficult. SRC appears to be one of the primary kinases activated following engagement of receptors and plays a role in the activation of other protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) families. Receptor clustering or dimerization leads to recruitment of SRC to the receptor complexes where it phosphorylates the tyrosine residues within the receptor cytoplasmic domains. Plays an important role in the regulation of cytoskeletal organization through phosphorylation of specific substrates such as AFAP1. Phosphorylation of AFAP1 allows the SRC SH2 domain to bind AFAP1 and to localize to actin filaments. Cytoskeletal reorganization is also controlled through the phosphorylation of cortactin (CTTN) (Probable). When cells adhere via focal adhesions to the extracellular matrix, signals are transmitted by integrins into the cell resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of focal adhesion proteins, including PTK2/FAK1 and paxillin (PXN) (PubMed:21411625). In addition to phosphorylating focal adhesion proteins, SRC is also active at the sites of cell-cell contact adherens junctions and phosphorylates substrates such as beta-catenin (CTNNB1), delta-catenin (CTNND1), and plakoglobin (JUP). Another type of cell-cell junction, the gap junction, is also a target for SRC, which phosphorylates connexin-43 (GJA1). SRC is implicated in regulation of pre-mRNA-processing and phosphorylates RNA-binding proteins such as KHDRBS1 (Probable). Phosphorylates PKP3 at 'Tyr-195' in response to reactive oxygen species, which may cause the release of PKP3 from desmosome cell junctions into the cytoplasm (PubMed:25501895). Also plays a role in PDGF-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of both STAT1 and STAT3, leading to increased DNA binding activity of these transcription factors (By similarity). Involved in the RAS pathway through phosphorylation of RASA1 and RASGRF1 (PubMed:11389730). Plays a role in EGF-mediated calcium-activated chloride channel activation (PubMed:18586953). Required for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) internalization through phosphorylation of clathrin heavy chain (CLTC and CLTCL1) at 'Tyr-1477'. Involved in beta-arrestin (ARRB1 and ARRB2) desensitization through phosphorylation and activation of GRK2, leading to beta-arrestin phosphorylation and internalization. Has a critical role in the stimulation of the CDK20/MAPK3 mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade by epidermal growth factor (Probable). Might be involved not only in mediating the transduction of mitogenic signals at the level of the plasma membrane but also in controlling progression through the cell cycle via interaction with regulatory proteins in the nucleus (PubMed:7853507). Plays an important role in osteoclastic bone resorption in conjunction with PTK2B/PYK2. Both the formation of a SRC-PTK2B/PYK2 complex and SRC kinase activity are necessary for this function. Recruited to activated integrins by PTK2B/PYK2, thereby phosphorylating CBL, which in turn induces the activation and recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to the cell membrane in a signaling pathway that is critical for osteoclast function (PubMed:14585963, PubMed:8755529). Promotes energy production in osteoclasts by activating mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase (PubMed:12615910). Phosphorylates DDR2 on tyrosine residues, thereby promoting its subsequent autophosphorylation (PubMed:16186108). Phosphorylates RUNX3 and COX2 on tyrosine residues, TNK2 on 'Tyr-284' and CBL on 'Tyr-731' (PubMed:20100835, PubMed:21309750). Enhances RIGI-elicited antiviral signaling (PubMed:19419966). Phosphorylates PDPK1 at 'Tyr-9', 'Tyr-373' and 'Tyr-376' (PubMed:14585963). Phosphorylates BCAR1 at 'Tyr-128' (PubMed:22710723). Phosphorylates CBLC at multiple tyrosine residues, phosphorylation at 'Tyr-341' activates CBLC E3 activity (PubMed:20525694). Phosphorylates synaptic vesicle protein synaptophysin (SYP) (By similarity). Involved in anchorage-independent cell growth (PubMed:19307596). Required for podosome formation (By similarity). Mediates IL6 signaling by activating YAP1-NOTCH pathway to induce inflammation-induced epithelial regeneration (PubMed:25731159). Phosphorylates OTUB1, promoting deubiquitination of RPTOR (PubMed:35927303). Phosphorylates caspase CASP8 at 'Tyr-380' which negatively regulates CASP8 processing and activation, down-regulating CASP8 proapoptotic function (PubMed:16619028)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nProto‐oncogene tyrosine‐protein kinase Src (commonly referred to as c‐Src or pp60c‐Src) is a founding member of the Src family kinases (SFKs), a conserved group of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases present from unicellular organisms to mammals (alvarez2006theroleof pages 1-2). Src is found in all metazoans, with orthologs identified in invertebrates and vertebrates, and its evolution reflects a diversification of regulatory mechanisms that parallel the emergence of multicellularity (mizenina2000kinasesofthe pages 2-4, parsons2004srcfamilykinases pages 3-4). As part of the kinome, Src is assigned to a subgroup of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases where its modular architecture is maintained by highly conserved regulatory and catalytic domains; this group evolved alongside other non‐receptor protein kinases with similar domain organizations (shah2018thesrcmodule pages 19-20).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nSrc catalyzes the transfer of the terminal phosphate group from ATP to specific tyrosine residues on protein substrates. In this reaction, ATP and a substrate protein containing an accessible tyrosine hydroxyl group produce ADP and a phosphotyrosine‐modified protein, thereby modulating the function of targeted proteins via post‐translational modification (frame2002srcincancer pages 2-4, shah2018thesrcmodule pages 27-28).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of Src requires the presence of divalent metal ions, with Mg²⁺ being the essential cofactor. Magnesium ions coordinate with ATP to facilitate the proper positioning of the phosphate groups within the active site, ensuring efficient phosphoryl transfer during the kinase reaction (mizenina2000kinasesofthe pages 2-4, parsons2004srcfamilykinases pages 3-4).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nSrc exhibits substrate specificity for tyrosine residues within its target proteins, with its recognition largely influenced by interactions mediated by its SH2 and SH3 domains. The kinase shows affinity for substrates associated with cell adhesion and cytoskeletal reorganization—including focal adhesion proteins such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin, as well as components of cell–cell junctions—and phosphorylates these substrates on specific tyrosine residues to regulate downstream signaling events (alvarez2006theroleof pages 2-4, frame2002srcincancer pages 2-4, parsons2004srcfamilykinases pages 3-4). Although a strict consensus motif has not been universally defined for Src, its substrate specificity is a function of both the catalytic domain’s inherent preference for tyrosine residues and the spatial-temporal recruitment of substrates via its regulatory domains (puchetamartinez2016anallostericcrosstalk pages 6-7).\n\n5. Structure  \nSrc is composed of several distinct domains that each contribute to its catalytic activity and regulation. Its N-terminal region contains a myristoylation signal that directs membrane association, which is essential for its proper subcellular localization (alvarez2006theroleof pages 1-2, mizenina2000kinasesofthe pages 2-4). This is followed by a unique domain that, while less conserved, contributes to the specificity of protein–protein interactions. Adjacent to this is the SH3 domain, which binds proline-rich sequences present in target or regulatory proteins, and the SH2 domain, which specifically recognizes phosphotyrosine motifs; both domains are critical for substrate selection and intramolecular interactions that maintain Src in its autoinhibited conformation (alvarez2006theroleof pages 2-4, berndt2021newstructuralperspectives pages 9-11). The central catalytic domain, also termed the kinase domain or SH1, features a bilobal structure with a smaller N-terminal lobe and a larger C-terminal lobe. Key structural elements include the activation loop—which contains the critical autophosphorylation site at Tyr416 that stabilizes the active conformation—the DFG motif and the αC-helix, as well as hydrophobic spines that contribute to the integrity of the active site (berndt2021newstructuralperspectives pages 9-11, mizenina2000kinasesofthe pages 2-4). The C-terminal tail contains a regulatory tyrosine residue (Tyr527 in human c-Src numbering) whose phosphorylation by kinases such as CSK enforces an intramolecular inhibitory interaction with the SH2 domain, thereby locking Src in a closed, inactive conformation (alvarez2006theroleof pages 1-2, mizenina2000kinasesofthe pages 5-7).\n\n6. Regulation  \nRegulation of Src activity is achieved through a combination of phosphorylation events, intramolecular domain interactions, and allosteric modulation. In its inactive state, Src is maintained in an autoinhibited conformation by the binding of the phosphorylated C-terminal tyrosine (Tyr527) to its own SH2 domain, with the SH3 domain engaging a polyproline motif in the linker region; this conformational arrangement restricts access to the catalytic site (alvarez2006theroleof pages 1-2, mizenina2000kinasesofthe pages 4-5). Activation of Src requires dephosphorylation of Tyr527, which disrupts these inhibitory interactions, and subsequent autophosphorylation at Tyr416 within the activation loop, a process critically dependent on intermolecular interactions and conformational flexibility (alvarez2006theroleof pages 2-4, berndt2021newstructuralperspectives pages 8-9). In addition, regulatory mechanisms include allosteric control through binding of SH2 and SH3 ligands, which can displace the intramolecular contacts and promote kinase activation (puchetamartinez2016anallostericcrosstalk pages 6-7, parsons2004srcfamilykinases pages 3-4). Src activity can also be modulated by redox mechanisms, whereby oxidation of specific cysteine residues alters its conformation and catalytic efficiency (giannoni2014redoxcircuitriesdriving pages 20-23). External signals from receptor tyrosine kinases, immune receptors, integrins, and G protein-coupled receptors result in receptor clustering and recruitment of Src to dynamic plasma membrane complexes, further influencing its activation state (alvarez2006theroleof pages 9-10, suga2018srcsignalingin pages 1-2).\n\n7. Function  \nSrc plays a central role in the transduction of signals emanating from a wide array of cellular receptors, including immune response receptors, integrins, receptor protein tyrosine kinases, G protein-coupled receptors, and cytokine receptors (alvarez2006theroleof pages 1-2). Upon receptor engagement, Src is recruited to the receptor complexes where it phosphorylates specific tyrosine residues on the receptors themselves as well as on downstream adaptor and effector proteins. This phosphorylation event initiates and amplifies signaling cascades that regulate diverse biological activities such as gene transcription, cell adhesion, cytoskeletal organization, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, migration, and cellular transformation (alvarez2006theroleof pages 2-4, berndt2021newstructuralperspectives pages 8-9). In the context of cell adhesion, Src phosphorylates substrates such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin, thereby modulating focal adhesion turnover and actin cytoskeletal dynamics, which are critical for cell migration and the formation of specialized cell–cell junctions including adherens and gap junctions (frame2002srcincancer pages 2-4, byeon2012theroleof pages 1-2). Src is further implicated in the regulation of pre-mRNA processing through phosphorylation of RNA-binding proteins, and it influences receptor internalization processes via phosphorylation of clathrin heavy chain (alvarez2006theroleof pages 4-5). In osteoclasts, Src is essential for bone resorption; its interaction with PTK2B/PYK2 and subsequent phosphorylation of downstream targets such as CBL leads to the recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, a critical step for osteoclast function (alvarez2006theroleof pages 8-9). Moreover, Src has been shown to participate in antiviral signaling, modulate signaling cascades downstream of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and affect gap junction communication by phosphorylating connexin-43, thereby underscoring its multifaceted role in cellular regulation (alvarez2006theroleof pages 8-9, giannoni2014redoxcircuitriesdriving pages 1-4).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSrc has been the target of extensive therapeutic research due to its involvement in oncogenesis and other diseases. Inhibition of Src activity using small-molecule inhibitors such as dasatinib and bosutinib has been explored in various clinical contexts, particularly in malignancies where aberrant Src activation contributes to tumor progression and metastasis (alvarez2006theroleof pages 8-9, puls2011currentstatusof pages 10-11). Src’s overexpression and deregulated kinase activity have been documented in a range of solid tumors, including breast, colon, pancreatic cancers, and hematologic malignancies, making its regulation a critical area of interest for targeted therapy (frame2002srcincancer pages 11-12, puls2011currentstatusof pages 11-11). Mutations and alterations that affect regulatory phosphorylation sites, such as those involving the C-terminal regulatory tyrosine or residues within the activation loop, are known to disrupt the delicate balance of Src regulation and promote oncogenic transformation (mizenina2000kinasesofthe pages 5-7, shah2018thesrcmodule pages 27-28). Additionally, redox regulation and post-translational modifications contribute to the complexity of Src’s function, and ongoing research continues to elucidate mechanisms that may be exploited for more selective therapeutic interventions (giannoni2014redoxcircuitriesdriving pages 20-23, byeon2012theroleof pages 11-13).\n\n9.

Stimulation by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) including EGFR, PDGFR, CSF1R and FGFR leads to recruitment of YES1 to the phosphorylated receptor, and activation and phosphorylation of downstream substrates. Upon EGFR activation, promotes the phosphorylation of PARD3 to favor epithelial tight junction assembly. Participates in the phosphorylation of specific junctional components such as CTNND1 by stimulating the FYN and FER tyrosine kinases at cell-cell contacts. Upon T-cell stimulation by CXCL12, phosphorylates collapsin response mediator protein 2/DPYSL2 and induces T-cell migration. Participates in CD95L/FASLG signaling pathway and mediates AKT-mediated cell migration. Plays a role in cell cycle progression by phosphorylating the cyclin-dependent kinase 4/CDK4 thus regulating the G1 phase. Also involved in G2/M progression and cytokinesis.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase Yes (encoded by YES1) is a member of the Src family kinases, a subgroup within the non‐receptor protein tyrosine kinases. Orthologs of YES1 have been identified in numerous vertebrate species, where the enzyme is highly conserved in both its catalytic domain and modular non‐catalytic regions. YES1 shares a common evolutionary origin with other Src family members such as c‐Src, Fyn, and Fgr, with phylogenetic studies indicating that the Src kinases emerged early in the evolution of metazoans (Manning et al. 2002, Manning et al. 2002). The conservation of core domains—including the N-terminal membrane-targeting SH4 domain, the Unique domain, the SH3 and SH2 domains, and the catalytic kinase (SH1) domain—reflects its common ancestry within the kinome and indicates that YES1 evolved from an ancestral kinase that gave rise to the modern Src family (huang2012generationoffn3 pages 22-27, kook2024emergingrolesof pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nYES1 catalyzes a phosphoryl transfer reaction in which the gamma-phosphate group from ATP is transferred to the hydroxyl group of a tyrosine residue on a substrate protein. In chemical terms, the reaction can be written as: ATP + [protein]-L-tyrosine → ADP + [protein]-L-tyrosine-phosphate + H⁺. This enzymatic activity is characteristic of protein tyrosine kinases and underlies the regulation of signal transduction cascades by modifying substrate proteins through phosphorylation (santos2013understandingtheenzymeinhibitor pages 20-25, loris2007exploringstructureand pages 21-24).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of YES1 depends on the binding of ATP as the phosphate donor, and like most protein kinases, its activity is strictly dependent on divalent metal ions. Mg²⁺ is typically required as a cofactor, facilitating the proper positioning of ATP within the active site and the subsequent transfer of the gamma phosphate to the substrate tyrosine (santos2013understandingtheenzymeinhibitor pages 20-25).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nYES1 phosphorylates specific tyrosine residues on target proteins, a specificity that is largely determined by its non-catalytic domains (SH2 and SH3) as well as by interactions with docking motifs present on substrates. Although no single linear consensus motif is universally reported for YES1, the phosphorylation event generally involves the recognition of substrates that display suitable phosphotyrosine binding sites and proline-rich sequences. In some instances, the downstream signaling roles of YES1 have been linked to the phosphorylation of key junctional components (for example, PARD3 during epithelial tight junction assembly) or regulatory proteins such as CTNND1, collapsin response mediator protein 2 (DPYSL2) during T-cell migration, and organic cation transporter OCT2, which leads to enhanced transport activity (kook2024emergingrolesof pages 1-2, summy2001functionaldomaincontributions pages 152-156). Experimental studies using chimeric Src family kinases have also revealed subtle differences in the intrinsic substrate specificity between YES1 and its close paralogs, emphasizing that the non-catalytic domains contribute significantly to the selection of physiological substrates (summy2001functionaldomaincontributions pages 152-156).\n\n5. Structure  \nYES1 is organized in a modular fashion, which is typical of Src family kinases. At the very N-terminus, it contains an SH4 domain that is subject to myristoylation and, in the case of YES1, additional palmitoylation; these lipid modifications are critical for membrane association and the spatial regulation of kinase activity. Immediately following the SH4 domain is the Unique domain, which is less conserved among family members and may serve to fine-tune the functional specificity of YES1. The central portion of the protein contains the SH3 domain, a structural module that adopts a β-barrel fold comprised of approximately 60 amino acids and mediates interactions with proline-rich sequences. Adjacent to it is the SH2 domain, which binds to phosphorylated tyrosine residues within specific amino acid contexts, thereby directing substrate recruitment and the formation of signaling assemblies. The C-terminal part of YES1 encompasses the catalytic kinase domain (SH1 domain), which is bilobed. The smaller N-terminal lobe primarily contributes to ATP binding via an antiparallel β-sheet, whereas the larger C-terminal lobe is responsible for substrate engagement and contains the activation loop. A critical tyrosine residue in the activation loop (Tyr-426 as noted in analogous Src family kinases) must undergo phosphorylation to achieve full catalytic activation, while phosphorylation of a C-terminal regulatory tyrosine (comparable to Tyr-537 in c-Src) promotes an autoinhibited conformation through intramolecular interactions with the SH2 domain (huang2012generationoffn3 pages 22-27, zhao2020scribblesubcellularlocalization pages 18-23).\n\n6. Regulation  \nRegulation of YES1 is achieved through a combination of post-translational modifications and conformational control mediated by its modular domains. Lipid modifications such as myristoylation of the SH4 domain and palmitoylation aid in its targeted localization to the plasma membrane and specific microdomains, ensuring proximity to substrates and regulatory partners. The kinase activity is fine-tuned by phosphorylation events: autophosphorylation within the activation loop (for example, at Tyr-426) enhances activity, whereas phosphorylation of the C-terminal regulatory residue (analogous to the mechanism observed in c-Src) promotes binding of the SH2 domain to the phosphorylated tail, thereby stabilizing the inactive, closed conformation. Additionally, interactions with receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g., EGFR, PDGFR, CSF1R, FGFR) lead to recruitment of YES1 to activated receptors where subsequent phosphorylation of downstream effectors occurs. Allosteric regulation is also mediated via its SH2 and SH3 domains; these domains not only facilitate intermolecular interactions with substrates and adaptor proteins but also contribute to intramolecular contacts that enforce the autoinhibited state in the absence of activating signals (zhao2020scribblesubcellularlocalization pages 18-23, huang2012generationoffn3 pages 22-27, summy2001functionaldomaincontributions pages 152-156).\n\n7. Function  \nYES1 plays multiple roles in cellular physiology through its activity as a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase. It is involved in the regulation of cell growth and survival as well as the control of apoptosis. YES1 contributes to cell–cell adhesion and the remodeling of the cytoskeleton, thereby influencing processes such as cell migration and differentiation. Following activation by upstream receptor tyrosine kinases—including EGFR, PDGFR, CSF1R, and FGFR—YES1 is recruited to phosphorylated receptors where it becomes activated and transduces signals by phosphorylating a variety of downstream substrates. For example, upon EGFR activation, YES1 phosphorylates PARD3, a modification that favors epithelial tight junction assembly. Additionally, YES1 is implicated in modulating junctional components such as CTNND1 via the stimulation of FYN and FER kinases at cell–cell contacts. In T cells, YES1 phosphorylates collapsin response mediator protein 2 (DPYSL2) following stimulation by CXCL12, thereby promoting migration. YES1 also participates in the CD95L/FASLG signaling pathway and mediates AKT-driven cell migration. Its role in cell cycle control is underscored by the phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), which regulates progression through the G1 phase, while its activity during G2/M progression and cytokinesis further highlights its importance in cell division. Additionally, YES1 phosphorylates organic cation transporter OCT2, resulting in increased transport activity (OpenTargets Search: -YES1, kook2024emergingrolesof pages 1-2, zhao2020scribblesubcellularlocalization pages 18-23).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nYES1 has attracted significant interest as a target in cancer therapy given its involvement in oncogenic signaling pathways, particularly in epithelial tumors such as lung, breast, ovarian, and skin cancers. Its overexpression or amplification has been documented in various human tumors and is often associated with aggressive phenotypes and drug resistance. Inhibitors targeting Src family kinases, such as dasatinib, have been reported to act on YES1, and iterative compound screening methods have identified additional small molecules capable of inhibiting its kinase activity (chiba2017aniterativecompound pages 4-7, kook2024emergingrolesof pages 2-4). While the specificity of available inhibitors for YES1 among members of the Src family can differ, these inhibitors provide opportunities for therapeutic intervention in YES1-driven cancers. No single mutation or disease-specific alteration in YES1 is uniformly reported; however, its dysregulation in cancer underscores its clinical relevance. Resources that compare kinase inhibitor profiles, such as the Chemical Probes portal and related databases, are recommended for further evaluation of compounds targeting YES1.\n\n9.

B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling requires a tight regulation of several protein tyrosine kinases and phosphatases, and associated coreceptors (By similarity). Binding of antigen to the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) triggers signaling that ultimately leads to B-cell activation (By similarity). Signaling through BLK plays an important role in transmitting signals through surface immunoglobulins and supports the pro-B to pre-B transition, as well as the signaling for growth arrest and apoptosis downstream of B-cell receptor (By similarity). Specifically binds and phosphorylates CD79A at 'Tyr-188'and 'Tyr-199', as well as CD79B at 'Tyr-196' and 'Tyr-207' (By similarity). Also phosphorylates the immunoglobulin G receptors FCGR2A, FCGR2B and FCGR2C (PubMed:8756631). With FYN and LYN, plays an essential role in pre-B-cell receptor (pre-BCR)-mediated NF-kappa-B activation (By similarity). Also contributes to BTK activation by indirectly stimulating BTK intramolecular autophosphorylation (By similarity). In pancreatic islets, acts as a modulator of beta-cells function through the up-regulation of PDX1 and NKX6-1 and consequent stimulation of insulin secretion in response to glucose (PubMed:19667185). Phosphorylates CGAS, promoting retention of CGAS in the cytosol (PubMed:30356214)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase Blk (BLK) is a member of the Src family of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases and is classified into the subfamily typically referred to as the “B‐cell–expressed Src kinases” along with other members such as HCK, LYN, and LCK. BLK is highly conserved among vertebrates and is predominantly expressed in cells of the B-lymphocyte lineage, with orthologs present in all mammalian species. Its evolutionary relationships within the human kinome trace back to early eukaryotic ancestors; like all Src family kinases, BLK shares a common modular architecture that has been maintained through evolution from yeast to man (boggon2004structureandregulation pages 1-2, zhang2021srcfamilyprotein pages 10-11).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nBLK catalyzes the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on protein substrates by transferring the terminal phosphate group from ATP to a target tyrosine residue. The generalized chemical reaction it performs is:  \n ATP + [protein]-tyrosine → ADP + [protein]-phosphotyrosine + H⁺ (template).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of BLK depends on the presence of divalent metal ions. Specifically, Mg²⁺ is required to facilitate ATP binding and proper positioning in the active site, which is a common feature shared by many protein tyrosine kinases (template, boggon2004structureandregulation pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nBLK is responsible for phosphorylating tyrosine residues within key immunoreceptor and adaptor proteins involved in B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling. Experimentally, BLK has been shown to phosphorylate CD79A at Tyr-188 and Tyr-199 and CD79B at Tyr-196 and Tyr-207, which are critical for downstream signal propagation. In addition, BLK can phosphorylate immunoglobulin receptors such as FCGR2A, FCGR2B, and FCGR2C in vitro (barreiro2017functionalstudiesof pages 43-47). Furthermore, microarray analyses of tyrosine kinase substrate specificities have revealed that kinases like BLK generally prefer a motif with an aliphatic residue (Ile, Leu, or Val) at the -1 position, a central tyrosine as the phosphorylation site, followed by a residue such as alanine, glycine, or aspartic acid at the +1 position, and hydrophobic residues (phenylalanine, isoleucine, or leucine) at the +2/+3 positions (deng2014globalanalysisof pages 19-22). These sequence preferences support BLK’s function in precisely targeting tyrosine residues that reside in defined immunoreceptor motifs, such as ITAMs, to regulate B cell activation.\n\n5. Structure  \nBLK exhibits the conserved domain organization characteristic of Src family kinases. At its N-terminus, BLK contains an SH4 domain with a critical glycine residue at position 2 that undergoes N-myristoylation; this lipid modification is essential for binding to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane and proper subcellular localization (barreiro2017functionalstudiesof pages 40-43, boggon2004structureandregulation pages 1-2). Following the SH4 region, BLK has a unique domain that, although less conserved among family members, is implicated in specifying interactions with cell-specific proteins. The central regions consist of an SH3 domain, which binds proline-rich motifs, and an SH2 domain that recognizes phosphotyrosine-containing sequences; these domains mediate both intramolecular interactions critical for maintaining an auto-inhibited conformation and intermolecular interactions with substrates and regulatory proteins (boggon2004structureandregulation pages 2-3, barreiro2017functionalstudiesof pages 40-43). Downstream of these regulatory modules is the catalytic kinase domain (SH1), which contains key features such as the activation loop—where autophosphorylation at a tyrosine residue (Y389 in BLK) is associated with full catalytic activation—and the C-terminal tail that includes an inhibitory phosphorylation site (Y501) that maintains the kinase in a closed, inactive conformation under basal conditions (barreiro2017functionalstudiesof pages 120-124, boggon2004structureandregulation pages 1-2). Notably, homology modeling approaches have been used to construct three‐dimensional structural models of BLK based on templates from other Src-family kinases, further corroborating its typical domain architecture and providing insights into the spatial arrangement of the activation loop, the hydrophobic spine, and the positioning of the C-helix. Structural studies have also identified that single amino acid variants such as the A71T substitution in the SH3 domain can alter the local structure by introducing additional hydrogen bonds and steric clashes with adjacent residues (e.g., Y69, N73, D76), impacting both the conformation and regulation of the enzyme (barreiro2017functionalstudiesof pages 76-80, barreiro2017functionalstudiesof pages 92-98).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe activity of BLK is intricately regulated by reversible phosphorylation and by protein-protein interactions mediated by its SH2 and SH3 domains. In its inactive state, BLK is predominantly phosphorylated at the C-terminal inhibitory tyrosine (Y501), which promotes an intramolecular interaction with the SH2 domain that locks the kinase in a closed conformation. Activation occurs when dephosphorylation of this inhibitory residue is accompanied by autophosphorylation of a tyrosine residue in the activation loop (Y389), which facilitates the transition to an open and active conformation capable of substrate binding (barreiro2017functionalstudiesof pages 120-124, boggon2004structureandregulation pages 1-2). A notable regulatory mechanism involves the A71T missense variant in the SH3 domain. This substitution disrupts intramolecular interactions that normally stabilize the auto-inhibited conformation, resulting in increased phosphorylation at both tyrosine and threonine residues and enhanced polyubiquitination; this in turn accelerates proteasomal degradation, indicating a balance between enhanced kinase activation and reduced protein stability (barreiro2017functionalstudiesof pages 76-80, barreiro2017functionalstudiesof pages 92-98). In addition, BLK’s membrane localization, mediated by its lipid modifications, is crucial for the regulation of its activity, as proper subcellular targeting facilitates interactions with downstream signaling partners such as phospholipase C gamma 2 (PLCG2) and the B-cell adaptor protein BANK1 (bernalquiros2013bank1andblk pages 4-4, sumera2023pharmacophorebasedhigh pages 1-2).\n\n7. Function  \nBLK plays an essential role in B-lymphocyte signaling, development, and differentiation. It is predominantly expressed in early B cells and persists into mature B cell populations, where it is involved in mediating signals downstream of the B cell receptor (BCR). Upon antigen binding to the BCR, BLK phosphorylates immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) located on the Igα (CD79A) and Igβ (CD79B) subunits, thereby initiating a cascade that includes the recruitment and activation of kinases such as SYK and BTK. This cascade is crucial for propagating signals that lead to B cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation, as well as for controlling transition events such as the pro-B to pre-B cell stage (barreiro2017functionalstudiesof pages 43-47, tretter2003mimicryofpre–b pages 1-2). In addition to its conventional role in BCR signaling, BLK is also involved in modulating alternative signaling pathways. For example, with FYN and LYN, BLK contributes to NF-κB activation—a process particularly relevant in pre-BCR–mediated signaling (barreiro2017functionalstudiesof pages 120-124). Beyond lymphocyte signal transduction, BLK has been implicated in the regulation of pancreatic β-cell function; in pancreatic islets, BLK modulates the expression of transcription factors such as PDX1 and NKX6-1, thereby enhancing insulin secretion in response to glucose stimulation (information). BLK furthermore phosphorylates the cytosolic DNA sensor CGAS, promoting its retention in the cytosol which may have implications for immune regulation (information).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nTargeting BLK pharmacologically has garnered interest because its dysregulation has been associated with autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis. Genetic polymorphisms in the BLK gene have been linked to altered expression levels in B cells and are associated with increased autoimmune risk (zhang2021srcfamilyprotein pages 6-7). Although direct inhibitors specific for BLK are not extensively documented, screening studies using pharmacophore-based high-throughput virtual screening approaches have identified compounds (e.g., Dasatinib, Ponatinib, and Saracatinib) that bind to highly conserved regions of the kinase domain of Src kinases, and which may also inhibit BLK with favorable binding energies (sumera2023pharmacophorebasedhigh pages 1-2, sumera2023pharmacophorebasedhigh pages 4-8). The interplay between BLK activation, its rapid ubiquitination and degradation (especially in the context of the A71T variant), and its precise substrate phosphorylation underscores the tight regulatory mechanisms required to maintain proper B-cell function and immune tolerance. BLK’s involvement in both oncogenic and immune regulatory pathways makes it a target of high pharmaceutical interest, particularly in hematologic malignancies and autoimmune conditions (barreiro2017functionalstudiesof pages 120-124, bolen1997leukocyteproteintyrosine pages 26-28).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase HCK is a member of the Src family kinases (SFKs), a well‐defined group of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases that are conserved from unicellular organisms to mammals (zhang2013srcfamilytyrosine pages 63-67). Within the SFK group, kinases are phylogenetically segregated into two subfamilies: Src-A, comprising ubiquitously expressed kinases such as c-Src and Fyn, and Src-B, which includes enzymes with more restricted expression in hematopoietic cells such as HCK and Lck (shah2018finetuningofsubstrate pages 3-4, zhang2013srcfamilytyrosine pages 67-72). Orthologs of HCK have been identified in a wide range of vertebrates, underscoring its ancient origin and its critical role in immune cell signaling. HCK shares high sequence identity—often greater than 64% in the kinase domain—with other SFKs and exhibits a domain organization that is characteristic of this family, further supporting its inclusion in the evolutionary core of non-receptor tyrosine kinases (kemble2009abiochemicalstudy pages 33-38, loris2007exploringstructureand pages 49-52).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nHCK catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of tyrosine residues on substrate proteins. In chemical terms, the enzyme facilitates the reaction:  \n  ATP + [protein]-tyrosine → ADP + [protein]-tyrosine-phosphate + H⁺  \nThis reaction is a hallmark of tyrosine kinases and constitutes the central biochemical activity that modulates downstream signaling events (hunter2015theeukaryoticprotein pages 1-3).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of HCK, like other protein kinases, is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions, most notably Mg²⁺. The Mg²⁺ ion serves to coordinate the ATP substrate within the active site, thereby facilitating the proper positioning of the γ-phosphate for transfer to the substrate tyrosine residue (cowanjacob2006structuralbiologyof pages 1-2, hunter2015theeukaryoticprotein pages 1-3).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nHigh-throughput specificity screens and motif analyses have demonstrated that HCK, as a Src-B kinase, exhibits a substrate specificity profile that is similar to that of Lck. In these studies, HCK shows a distinct preference for substrates bearing negatively charged (acidic) residues downstream of the phosphotyrosine, a feature that contrasts with the substrate preferences of Src-A kinases such as c-Src, which tend to favor substrates with positively charged residues downstream (shah2018finetuningofsubstrate pages 10-12). Additional positional data indicate that for SFKs, including HCK, the amino acid immediately preceding the target tyrosine is often a large hydrophobic residue, while positions immediately following the phosphorylated tyrosine may possess acidic residues that contribute to binding affinity and specificity (corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 86-90, zhang2013srcfamilytyrosine pages 55-59). Although a strict linear consensus motif for HCK has not been explicitly defined, aggregated phosphoproteomic studies suggest that HCK substrates are enriched with specific charged and hydrophobic residues in defined positions relative to the phosphorylated tyrosine (corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 126-130).\n\n5. Structure  \nHCK exhibits the canonical modular architecture of Src family kinases. At the N-terminus, HCK contains a unique sequence that includes a myristoylation signal, which is critical for membrane localization in hematopoietic cells (sakkiah2017overviewofthe pages 2-3). Following the unique domain is the SH3 domain, which binds to proline-rich motifs and contributes to both intramolecular autoinhibition and substrate recruitment. Next, the SH2 domain is present; it recognizes phosphorylated tyrosine motifs, facilitating both regulation and the formation of signaling complexes. The C-terminal portion of HCK encompasses the catalytic kinase domain (also known as the SH1 domain), which is organized into two lobes—a smaller N-terminal lobe primarily composed of β-sheets and a larger C-terminal lobe rich in α-helices. This bilobed arrangement creates the ATP-binding cleft and houses key elements such as the activation loop, the DFG motif within the activation segment, and the C-helix, which are critical for catalysis and regulation (cowanjacob2006structuralbiologyof pages 1-2, sakkiah2017overviewofthe pages 2-3). Experimental crystallographic studies on closely related SFKs support that HCK shares these conserved features, including a well-defined hydrophobic spine that stabilizes the active conformation. Unique to HCK is its regulatory N-terminal region that may differ in sequence length and composition relative to other SFKs, thus contributing to its hematopoietic-specific functional nuances (zhang2013srcfamilytyrosine pages 59-63).\n\n6. Regulation  \nRegulation of HCK occurs through multiple mechanisms common to Src family kinases. Autoinhibitory interactions are central to maintaining HCK in an inactive conformation. In the basal state, intramolecular interactions occur when the SH2 domain binds to a phosphorylated tyrosine located in the C-terminal tail and the SH3 domain engages a proline-rich region in the linker between the SH2 and kinase domains. These interactions lock HCK into a “closed” conformation that limits substrate access (kemble2009abiochemicalstudy pages 150-155, cowanjacob2006structuralbiologyof pages 7-8). Activation of HCK is achieved by disruption of these intramolecular contacts, which can occur through dephosphorylation of the inhibitory C-terminal phosphotyrosine or through binding of external ligands that outcompete the intramolecular interactions. Subsequent autophosphorylation of a tyrosine residue located in the activation loop stabilizes the active kinase conformation and enhances catalytic activity (kemble2009abiochemicalstudy pages 150-155, shah2018finetuningofsubstrate pages 3-4). In addition, regulatory inputs from other kinases or adaptor proteins may modulate HCK activity, integrating it into broader signaling pathways that control cellular responses such as proliferation and cytoskeletal rearrangement (corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 13-16).\n\n7. Function  \nHCK is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells, including neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and mast cells, where it plays a critical role in innate immune responses (shah2018finetuningofsubstrate pages 23-24, zhang2013srcfamilytyrosine pages 67-72). It transduces signals from an array of cell surface receptors such as Fc receptors (FCGR1A, FCGR2A), cytokine receptors (for IFNG, IL2, IL6, and IL8), CSF3R, and integrins (ITGB1, ITGB2). Through its tyrosine kinase activity, HCK phosphorylates a variety of substrates including CBL, ADAM15, BCR, ELMO1, GAB1, GAB2, RAPGEF1, STAT5B, TP73, VAV1, and WAS, thereby modulating pathways involved in phagocytosis, degranulation, actin cytoskeletal reorganization, and the respiratory burst mediated by NADPH oxidase activation (shah2018finetuningofsubstrate pages 23-24, kemble2009abiochemicalstudy pages 146-150). HCK’s actions contribute to several key biological processes:  \n • Signal transduction downstream of immunoglobulin receptor engagement, leading to the mobilization of secretory lysosomes and the formation of cell protrusions and podosomes, which are imperative for cell adhesion and migration.  \n • Regulation of cell survival and proliferation in immune cells, partly through its ability to phosphorylate proteins involved in growth and apoptotic pathways, such as TP73.  \n • Modulation of inflammatory responses through the phosphorylation of substrates that regulate the release of inflammatory mediators (shah2018finetuningofsubstrate pages 23-24, zhang2013srcfamilytyrosine pages 72-76).  \nIn embryonic stem cells, studies have shown that SFK members including HCK participate in the maintenance of the undifferentiated state, demonstrating that its expression is downregulated upon differentiation (zhang2013srcfamilytyrosine pages 120-124).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral small-molecule inhibitors targeting Src family kinases have been developed and are being evaluated for therapeutic applications in cancers and inflammatory diseases; these inhibitors typically target the ATP-binding site within the kinase domain (hunter2015theeukaryoticprotein pages 6-8, sakkiah2017overviewofthe pages 2-3). Although many inhibitors exhibit cross-reactivity among SFK members, selective modulation of HCK activity remains an area of active investigation, given its pivotal role in hematopoietic cell signaling and innate immune responses. Dysregulated HCK activity has been associated with pathological conditions such as leukemia, chronic inflammatory diseases, and disorders of immune cell function (shah2018finetuningofsubstrate pages 23-24, kemble2009abiochemicalstudy pages 146-150). In addition, attempts to decipher HCK substrate specificity using yeast-based phosphoproteomic approaches have provided insights that may facilitate the design of more specific inhibitors and diagnostic tools (corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 146-149).\n\n9.

Plays a key role in T-cell antigen receptor (TCR)-linked signal transduction pathways. Constitutively associated with the cytoplasmic portions of the CD4 and CD8 surface receptors. Association of the TCR with a peptide antigen-bound MHC complex facilitates the interaction of CD4 and CD8 with MHC class II and class I molecules, respectively, thereby recruiting the associated LCK protein to the vicinity of the TCR/CD3 complex. LCK then phosphorylates tyrosine residues within the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAM) of the cytoplasmic tails of the TCR-gamma chains and CD3 subunits, initiating the TCR/CD3 signaling pathway. Once stimulated, the TCR recruits the tyrosine kinase ZAP70, that becomes phosphorylated and activated by LCK. Following this, a large number of signaling molecules are recruited, ultimately leading to lymphokine production. LCK also contributes to signaling by other receptor molecules. Associates directly with the cytoplasmic tail of CD2, which leads to hyperphosphorylation and activation of LCK. Also plays a role in the IL2 receptor-linked signaling pathway that controls the T-cell proliferative response. Binding of IL2 to its receptor results in increased activity of LCK. Is expressed at all stages of thymocyte development and is required for the regulation of maturation events that are governed by both pre-TCR and mature alpha beta TCR. Phosphorylates other substrates including RUNX3, PTK2B/PYK2, the microtubule-associated protein MAPT, RHOH or TYROBP.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase Lck (LCK) is a member of the Src family kinases (SFKs), a group of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases that are evolutionarily conserved across metazoans and central to the regulation of immune cell signaling. Lck shares homology with other SFK members such as Fyn, Src, and Lyn, and orthologs of Lck are found in mammals where its function in T‐cell signaling is essential; its conservation reflects its critical role in thymocyte development and T‐cell activation (hans1996srcfamilykinases pages 14-18, posevitz2007functionalelucidationof pages 34-37). As outlined in kinome-wide classifications, Lck is part of an evolutionary core set of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases that emerged early in eukaryotic evolution and has been maintained as a key regulator of antigen receptor signaling in lymphocytes (hans1996srcfamilykinases pages 25-29, ubau2013functionalcharacterizationof pages 12-15).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nLck catalyzes the phosphorylation reaction in which a phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is transferred to a tyrosine residue on a substrate protein. The chemical reaction can be represented schematically as follows: ATP + [protein]-tyrosine → ADP + [protein]-phosphotyrosine + H⁺ (chylek2014phosphorylationsitedynamics pages 16-16).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe enzymatic activity of Lck is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions, with Mg²⁺ serving as the essential cofactor required for ATP binding and the subsequent transfer of the phosphate group to the substrate (banerjee2013phosphorylationubiquitylationand pages 26-29).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nLck exhibits a substrate specificity that is defined by its ability to recognize and phosphorylate specific tyrosine residues predominantly present within immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) on T-cell receptor (TCR) complex proteins. In the context of TCR signaling, Lck specifically phosphorylates tyrosine residues on CD3 subunits and the TCR-ζ chains, thereby creating docking sites for the tandem SH2 domains of the kinase ZAP70 (chylek2014phosphorylationsitedynamics pages 5-7, posevitz2007functionalelucidationof pages 37-40). In addition, Lck has been shown to phosphorylate a range of substrates including components of the costimulatory pathways such as the cytoplasmic tail of CD2 and even non-TCR substrates like RUNX3 and PTK2B/PYK2, with amino acid preferences that often include basic or hydrophobic residues in a local sequence context that facilitates SH2 and SH3 domain-mediated interactions (banerjee2013phosphorylationubiquitylationand pages 20-26).\n\n5. Structure  \nLck possesses a modular domain organization characteristic of Src family kinases. It has an N-terminal SH4 (unique) domain, which contains a myristoylation signal critical for its membrane targeting and association with the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane; this is followed by a unique region that mediates selective protein–protein interactions, especially with the cytoplasmic tails of co-receptors such as CD4 and CD8. Adjacent to the unique region are the SH3 and SH2 domains, with the SH3 domain recognizing proline-rich motifs and the SH2 domain binding phosphorylated tyrosine residues, thus contributing to autoinhibitory interactions and substrate selection. Lck’s catalytic (kinase) domain follows, which contains the conserved activation loop (T-loop) and exhibits regulatory phosphorylation sites, including the activating autophosphorylation site Tyr-394 and the inhibitory C-terminal tyrosine (commonly designated as Tyr-505 in analogous SFKs), that control its conformational state and catalytic activity (hans1996srcfamilykinases pages 25-29, chylek2014phosphorylationsitedynamics pages 16-16). This arrangement allows Lck to adopt distinct structural conformations: an open, active form when dephosphorylated at the inhibitory tyrosine and phosphorylated at the activation loop, and a closed, autoinhibited form when the SH2 domain binds to the phosphorylated C-terminal tail (posevitz2007functionalelucidationof pages 43-46).\n\n6. Regulation  \nLck activity is tightly regulated by a combination of post-translational modifications, protein–protein interactions, and subcellular localization dynamics. Phosphorylation of Tyr-394 within the activation loop enhances Lck’s kinase activity, whereas phosphorylation of the C-terminal inhibitory tyrosine (comparable to Tyr-505 in other SFKs) induces an intramolecular interaction with the SH2 domain that results in a closed, less active conformation. Enzymes such as C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) phosphorylate the inhibitory tyrosine to maintain Lck in an inactive state, while phosphatases like CD45 dephosphorylate this residue to prime Lck for activation. Additional regulatory modulation is achieved via reversible lipid modifications, including N-terminal myristoylation and potential palmitoylation, which facilitate membrane localization, and interactions with adaptor proteins such as PAG and costimulatory molecules like CD2, all of which contribute to compartmentalizing Lck’s activity within specialized microdomains (chylek2014phosphorylationsitedynamics pages 14-14, posevitz2007functionalelucidationof pages 95-97, hans1996srcfamilykinases pages 195-200).\n\n7. Function  \nLck plays a central role in T-cell biology, being expressed at all stages of thymocyte development and essential for both the selection and maturation of T-cells within the thymus. It is constitutively associated with the cytoplasmic portions of CD4 and CD8 co-receptors, and upon engagement of the T-cell receptor (TCR) with a peptide–MHC complex, Lck phosphorylates ITAMs on the CD3 and TCR-ζ chains, thereby initiating a signaling cascade that leads to the recruitment and activation of the tyrosine kinase ZAP70. This event triggers downstream signaling pathways that ultimately result in lymphokine synthesis, T-cell proliferation, and differentiation. In addition to its established role in TCR signaling, Lck is also involved in signaling initiated by other receptors such as CD2 and the interleukin-2 (IL2) receptor, contributing to multiple aspects of T-cell function including adhesion, migration, and proliferation. Lck phosphorylates substrates including RUNX3, PTK2B/PYK2, the microtubule-associated protein MAPT, RHOH, and TYROBP, thereby integrating signals from diverse receptors to fine-tune immune responses (chylek2014phosphorylationsitedynamics pages 15-16, posevitz2007functionalelucidationof pages 43-46, ubau2013functionalcharacterizationof pages 91-92).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nA range of selective inhibitors targeting Src family kinases, including Lck, have been developed for experimental and therapeutic purposes; abnormal Lck activity has been implicated in immune deficiencies, autoimmune disorders, and oncogenic transformations such as T-cell leukemia. Mutational analyses have underscored the importance of specific phosphorylation sites, with alterations in the regulatory tyrosine residues leading to dysregulated kinase activity. Although detailed inhibitor profiles specific to Lck are not provided in the available context, the development and application of ATP-competitive inhibitors remain a prominent strategy for modulating its activity in pathological conditions (banerjee2013phosphorylationubiquitylationand pages 26-29, posevitz2007functionalelucidationof pages 43-46).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase Lyn is a member of the Src family kinases (SFKs), which belong to the non‐receptor tyrosine kinase group in the human kinome. Lyn is evolutionarily related to other SFK members such as c‐Src, Fyn, Hck, Blk, Lck, and Yes, and it is phylogenetically assigned to the Src B subgroup, sharing a common origin with these kinases that can be traced back to the early eukaryotic ancestors (ubau2013functionalcharacterizationof pages 15-18, huang2016directedevolutionof pages 1-2). Orthologs of Lyn and its related SFKs are found in vertebrates, consistent with the conserved nature of signaling modules established in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) (corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 13-16).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nTyrosine-protein kinase Lyn catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to a tyrosine residue on substrate proteins. The chemical reaction can be summarized as:  \nATP + [protein]-L-tyrosine → ADP + [protein]-L-tyrosine-phosphate + H⁺ (ubau2013functionalcharacterizationof pages 15-18, loris2007exploringstructureand pages 49-52).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of Lyn is dependent on the presence of divalent cations, with Mg²⁺ serving as a necessary cofactor in the catalytic transfer of phosphate from ATP to substrate proteins (loris2007exploringstructureand pages 49-52).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nLyn phosphorylates substrate proteins by recognizing specific amino acid motifs surrounding target tyrosine residues. Although an exact consensus motif has not been exhaustively defined in the provided texts, biochemical analyses indicate a preference for substrates exemplified by the LYNtide peptide, where studies report a Km in the low micromolar range and demonstrably higher catalytic efficiency for Lyn compared to related kinases such as Syk (sun2022targetingproteinproteininteractions pages 125-130). Moreover, motif-based phosphorylation studies using yeast models and computational predictions indicate that Lyn, along with other Src family kinases, phosphorylates substrates within sequence contexts that include proline-rich flanking regions and specific surrounding amino acids; these motifs have been linked to downstream signaling components such as immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation and inhibitory motifs (corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 152-155, corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 146-149).\n\n5. Structure  \nLyn is organized into several well-defined domains that are characteristic of SFKs. At the N-terminus, a short unique region contains myristoylation and palmitoylation sites that mediate membrane association and subcellular localization, particularly to cholesterol-rich lipid rafts (ubau2013functionalcharacterizationof pages 6-8, ubau2013functionalcharacterizationof pages 64-68). Adjacent to the unique region is the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, which plays a critical role in mediating protein–protein interactions by binding to proline-rich motifs; this domain has been a target for engineered affinity reagents such as FN3 monobodies that exhibit high specificity for Lyn (huang2016directedevolutionof pages 1-2, huang2016directedevolutionof pages 6-7). Following the SH3 domain is the SH2 domain, which recognizes phosphorylated tyrosine residues on partner proteins, thereby facilitating the assembly of signaling complexes (ubau2013functionalcharacterizationof pages 15-18, corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 16-18). The C-terminal region comprises the kinase catalytic (SH1) domain, which contains essential catalytic features such as the activation loop, C-helix, and a regulatory tail that harbors a key inhibitory tyrosine residue (Tyr530 in the human enzyme) and an activation loop tyrosine (Tyr419) whose phosphorylation status modulates kinase activity (ubau2013functionalcharacterizationof pages 15-18, loris2007exploringstructureand pages 138-143). Overall, the three-dimensional structure of Lyn, as predicted by crystal structures and AlphaFold models, reveals a bilobal kinase domain typical of protein kinases with a conserved ATP-binding cleft and regulatory elements that dictate its allosteric activation (loris2007exploringstructureand pages 49-52).\n\n6. Regulation  \nLyn activity is finely regulated through multiple mechanisms. Key regulatory post-translational modifications include phosphorylation events; phosphorylation of the C-terminal tyrosine residue (Tyr530) by C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) promotes an auto-inhibited conformation, while autophosphorylation of the activation loop tyrosine (Tyr419) facilitates full kinase activation (ubau2013functionalcharacterizationof pages 15-18, corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 73-76). Additionally, Lyn is subject to dephosphorylation by protein tyrosine phosphatases such as PTPα, which can subsequently activate the kinase (ubau2013functionalcharacterizationof pages 15-18). Ubiquitination by E3-ubiquitin ligases such as CBL further contributes to its regulation by marking activated kinases for proteasomal degradation (ubau2013functionalcharacterizationof pages 18-21, corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 10-13). Moreover, Lyn’s subcellular localization, dictated by lipid modifications, permits its compartmentalized function; its proper targeting to, or aberrant distribution from, lipid rafts critically influences its ability to engage in specific signaling interactions, such as those downstream of the B-cell receptor (ubau2013functionalcharacterizationof pages 64-68, ubau2013functionalcharacterizationof pages 70-73). Interaction with adaptor proteins, and the consequent phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), recruits phosphatases including SHP-1, SHP-2, and SHIP-1 which act as negative regulators of signaling cascades (ubau2013functionalcharacterizationof pages 89-91, corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 152-155).\n\n7. Function  \nLyn plays a central role in the regulation of both innate and adaptive immune responses. It is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells, with high expression in B lymphocytes, where it is both necessary for initiating B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling and for mediating the subsequent down-regulation and termination of the response (ubau2013functionalcharacterizationof pages 1-5, ubau2013functionalcharacterizationof pages 54-58). Lyn phosphorylates a broad range of substrates, including proteins involved in B-cell activation such as CD79A, CD79B, CD19, and CD22, as well as downstream signaling effectors like SYK, BTK, and components of the MAPK cascade (ubau2013functionalcharacterizationof pages 73-76, corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 152-155). In addition to its critical function in B-cell signaling, Lyn is involved in the regulation of integrin signaling, responses to growth factors and cytokines, and plays an important role in hematopoiesis, platelet function, and the inflammatory response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (ubau2013functionalcharacterizationof pages 68-70, sun2022targetingproteinproteininteractions pages 79-82). It is also implicated in the control of cell survival, proliferation, and apoptosis across various cell types, acting both as a positive and as a negative modulator depending on cellular context. Lyn’s downstream signaling involves regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity, subsequent activation of AKT1, and modulation of the MAP kinase cascade, which includes kinases such as ERK1/2 and JNKs (ubau2013functionalcharacterizationof pages 54-58, corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 178-180). Through its ability to phosphorylate inhibitory motifs on receptors or adaptors, Lyn recruits phosphatases that attenuate signal transduction, thus contributing to immune self-tolerance and regulating inflammatory responses (ubau2013functionalcharacterizationof pages 89-92, chylek2014phosphorylationsitedynamics pages 15-16).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral inhibitors have been used experimentally to target Lyn kinase activity. For example, Dasatinib, an FDA-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor, exhibits potent inhibition of Lyn with an IC₅₀ in the low nanomolar range (huang2016directedevolutionof pages 17-18). Other compounds such as SU6656, a Src family selective inhibitor, have been employed in functional studies to assess Lyn’s role in leukemic cell proliferation, notably in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ubau2013functionalcharacterizationof pages 38-42, ubau2013functionalcharacterizationof pages 73-76). Disease associations for Lyn include its involvement in various hematologic malignancies such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, as well as reported implications in several solid tumors where aberrant expression or mislocalization can affect cellular proliferation and survival (ubau2013functionalcharacterizationof pages 50-54, ubau2013functionalcharacterizationof pages 68-70). Additionally, altered Lyn signaling has been linked to defects in immune regulation and inflammatory responses, which are central to autoimmune conditions (ubau2013functionalcharacterizationof pages 12-15, corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 10-13).\n\n9.

Coordinates actin remodeling through tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins controlling cytoskeleton dynamics like WASF3 (involved in branch formation); ANXA1 (involved in membrane anchoring); DBN1, DBNL, CTTN, RAPH1 and ENAH (involved in signaling); or MAPT and PXN (microtubule-binding proteins). Phosphorylation of WASF3 is critical for the stimulation of lamellipodia formation and cell migration. Involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and motility through phosphorylation of key regulators of these processes such as BCAR1, CRK, CRKL, DOK1, EFS or NEDD9 (PubMed:22810897). Phosphorylates multiple receptor tyrosine kinases and more particularly promotes endocytosis of EGFR, facilitates the formation of neuromuscular synapses through MUSK, inhibits PDGFRB-mediated chemotaxis and modulates the endocytosis of activated B-cell receptor complexes. Other substrates which are involved in endocytosis regulation are the caveolin (CAV1) and RIN1. Moreover, ABL1 regulates the CBL family of ubiquitin ligases that drive receptor down-regulation and actin remodeling. Phosphorylation of CBL leads to increased EGFR stability. Involved in late-stage autophagy by regulating positively the trafficking and function of lysosomal components. ABL1 targets to mitochondria in response to oxidative stress and thereby mediates mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. In response to oxidative stress, phosphorylates serine/threonine kinase PRKD2 at 'Tyr-717' (PubMed:28428613). ABL1 is also translocated in the nucleus where it has DNA-binding activity and is involved in DNA-damage response and apoptosis. Many substrates are known mediators of DNA repair: DDB1, DDB2, ERCC3, ERCC6, RAD9A, RAD51, RAD52 or WRN. Activates the proapoptotic pathway when the DNA damage is too severe to be repaired. Phosphorylates TP73, a primary regulator for this type of damage-induced apoptosis. Phosphorylates the caspase CASP9 on 'Tyr-153' and regulates its processing in the apoptotic response to DNA damage. Phosphorylates PSMA7 that leads to an inhibition of proteasomal activity and cell cycle transition blocks. ABL1 also acts as a regulator of multiple pathological signaling cascades during infection. Several known tyrosine-phosphorylated microbial proteins have been identified as ABL1 substrates. This is the case of A36R of Vaccinia virus, Tir (translocated intimin receptor) of pathogenic E.coli and possibly Citrobacter, CagA (cytotoxin-associated gene A) of H.pylori, or AnkA (ankyrin repeat-containing protein A) of A.phagocytophilum. Pathogens can highjack ABL1 kinase signaling to reorganize the host actin cytoskeleton for multiple purposes, like facilitating intracellular movement and host cell exit. Finally, functions as its own regulator through autocatalytic activity as well as through phosphorylation of its inhibitor, ABI1. Regulates T-cell differentiation in a TBX21-dependent manner (By similarity). Positively regulates chemokine-mediated T-cell migration, polarization, and homing to lymph nodes and immune-challenged tissues, potentially via activation of NEDD9/HEF1 and RAP1 (By similarity). Phosphorylates TBX21 on tyrosine residues leading to an enhancement of its transcriptional activator activity (By similarity)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nABL1 (also known as c‑Abl or p150) is a member of the Abl family of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases, which includes the paralog ABL2 (commonly referred to as Arg). Orthologs of ABL1 are conserved throughout metazoans, with homologous proteins identified in both vertebrates and invertebrates. The Abl kinases belong to the tyrosine kinase group of the human kinome and share structural and evolutionary characteristics with other non‐receptor tyrosine kinases, albeit with a distinctive regulatory mechanism that includes a myristoylated N‑terminus and an \"SH3–SH2 clamp.\" This evolutionary conservation implies that ABL1 has an ancient origin and an essential role in coordinating signaling networks from yeast through to man (colicelli2010abltyrosinekinases pages 1-2, greuber2013roleofabl pages 1-2, koleske2006mechanismsofactivation pages 1-3).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nABL1 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of a tyrosine residue on substrate proteins. The reaction can be summarized as follows:  \nATP + [protein]‑(L‑tyrosine) → ADP + [protein]‑phospho‑tyrosine + H⁺  \nThis phosphorylation reaction modulates the function of substrate proteins by altering their activity, interactions, or subcellular localization (colicelli2010abltyrosinekinases pages 2-4).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of ABL1 depends on the presence of divalent metal ions, most notably Mg²⁺. Mg²⁺ is essential for the proper coordination of ATP within the active site and for facilitating the phosphoryl transfer reaction (irgit2025structureanddynamics pages 1-3, hantschel2012structureregulationsignaling pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nABL1 displays substrate specificity that is determined both by intrinsic features of its kinase domain and by docking interactions mediated by its SH2 and SH3 domains. Biochemical studies, particularly in ancestral Abl kinases, have indicated a preference for peptide motifs such as “IYAAP” and related sequences. More generally, ABL1 appears to favor substrate sequences containing specific hydrophobic and proline residues that are critical for effective binding and phosphorylation. In addition to sequence preferences, substrate specificity is also dictated by the ability of substrates to engage the regulatory docking sites provided by the SH2 and SH3 domains (aleem2015constitutiveactivityin pages 10-11, colicelli2010abltyrosinekinases pages 7-8, greuber2013roleofabl pages 5-7).\n\n5. Structure  \nABL1 exhibits a multi‐domain architecture that is central to its catalytic and regulatory functions. At the N‑terminus, the protein contains a region that in some isoforms undergoes co‑translational myristoylation; this lipid modification plays an important role in maintaining the enzyme’s autoinhibited state by facilitating binding of the myristoyl group within a deep hydrophobic pocket of the kinase domain. Adjacent to this is an N‑terminal “Cap” region that also contributes to autoinhibition. Following the N‑terminal regulatory elements, ABL1 contains a tandem arrangement of the SH3 and SH2 domains. The SH3 domain, which typically binds polyproline type II helices, in this context participates in intramolecular interactions with a linker region between the SH2 and kinase domains, while the SH2 domain binds to a phosphotyrosine motif within the kinase domain’s C‑lobe. These interactions collectively form an “SH3–SH2 clamp” that keeps the kinase in a low‑activity conformation.  \nThe central catalytic (kinase) domain exhibits a bilobal structure: a smaller N‑terminal lobe containing a glycine‑rich P‑loop responsible for ATP binding and positioning, and a larger C‑terminal lobe that provides the substrate binding site. Critical to its activation is the conformation of the activation loop, which contains conserved tyrosine residues (for example, Tyr412 in mammalian ABL1) that must become phosphorylated to permit full catalytic activity. Additionally, features such as the C‑helix and hydrophobic spines help stabilize either the inactive or active conformations. The C‑terminal region of ABL1 harbors domains involved in binding actin and DNA, thereby influencing cytoskeletal dynamics and nuclear functions, respectively. This structural organization is supported by crystallographic studies and computational models (colicelli2010abltyrosinekinases pages 1-2, hantschel2012structureregulationsignaling pages 1-2, irgit2025structureanddynamics pages 1-3, koleske2006mechanismsofactivation pages 1-3).\n\n6. Regulation  \nABL1 is subject to elaborate regulatory mechanisms that ensure its kinase activity is tightly controlled. Autoinhibition is a hallmark of ABL1 regulation: the SH3 domain binds a proline‐rich linker between the SH2 and kinase domains, and the SH2 domain simultaneously interacts with the C‑lobe of the kinase domain, collectively stabilizing an inactive conformation. Myristoylation of the N‑terminal region further reinforces autoinhibition by docking into a hydrophobic pocket within the kinase domain. Activation of ABL1 is associated with specific phosphorylation events, most notably at tyrosines such as Tyr245 and Tyr412; these phosphorylation events relieve the autoinhibitory interactions, leading to a conformational reorganization that permits substrate access. In addition to autophosphorylation, binding of regulatory adaptor proteins—for example, RIN1—can enhance ABL1 catalytic efficiency by promoting structural rearrangements that favor the active state. Other post‑translational modifications, including ubiquitination and acetylation, impact ABL1 stability and subcellular localization. Lipid interactions, such as those with PIP₂, can also modulate kinase activity by influencing membrane association and conformational transitions (colicelli2010abltyrosinekinases pages 4-5, hantschel2012structureregulationsignaling pages 2-3, aleem2015constitutiveactivityin pages 4-6).\n\n7. Function  \nABL1 is a multifunctional kinase with roles in a wide range of cellular processes essential for cell growth, survival, and homeostasis. In the cytoplasm, ABL1 regulates cytoskeletal remodeling by phosphorylating several proteins that control actin dynamics, such as WASF3 (which is critical for lamellipodia formation and cell migration), ANXA1, DBN1, DBNL, CTTN, RAPH1, and ENAH. Phosphorylation of these substrates facilitates changes in cell shape, motility, and adhesion. ABL1 modulates microtubule dynamics by targeting proteins such as MAPT and PXN, thereby contributing to the regulation of cell polarity and intracellular transport.  \nIn addition, ABL1 phosphorylates receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g., EGFR) and other membrane-associated proteins, such as CAV1 and RIN1, functioning in receptor endocytosis and down-regulation. Through its regulation of the CBL family of ubiquitin ligases, ABL1 indirectly contributes to the modulation of receptor stability and turnover. ABL1 also plays a key role in autophagy, particularly in the late stages where it supports trafficking and function of lysosomal components.  \nWithin the nucleus, ABL1 is capable of DNA binding and is a significant mediator of the DNA damage response. It phosphorylates components of the DNA repair machinery—including DDB1, DDB2, ERCC3, ERCC6, RAD9A, RAD51, RAD52, and WRN—thereby facilitating repair processes or, in cases of excessive damage, activating proapoptotic pathways by phosphorylating factors such as TP73 and CASP9. Furthermore, ABL1 phosphorylates other substrates involved in cell cycle regulation (for example, PSMA7) which contribute to cell cycle arrest under stress conditions. Beyond these roles, ABL1 is involved in regulating T-cell differentiation and migration through phosphorylation of TBX21 and modulation of NEDD9/HEF1 and RAP1 signaling (greuber2013roleofabl pages 19-22, wang2014thecapableabl pages 1-2, sato2012functionalmechanismsand pages 2-4).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nABL1 is a high-profile target in therapeutic oncology. Its aberrant activation is most famously represented by the BCR‑ABL1 fusion protein, which arises from the Philadelphia chromosome translocation in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and certain acute lymphoblastic leukemias. This fusion protein loses portions of the N‑terminal autoinhibitory regions, including the myristoylation site and Cap domain, resulting in constitutive kinase activity. ABL1 inhibitors such as imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, and ponatinib are used clinically to target BCR‑ABL1, while newer allosteric inhibitors (e.g., GNF‑2 and GNF‑5) that bind the myristoyl pocket offer promising strategies for overcoming resistance due to mutations. In addition to its oncogenic roles in hematological malignancies, abnormal ABL1 signaling has been implicated in various solid tumors through its regulation of cell motility, invasion, and apoptosis. Moreover, ABL1 is hijacked by microbial proteins during infection—for example, by Vaccinia virus A36R and H. pylori CagA—to manipulate the host actin cytoskeleton. Mutations that disrupt normal regulatory interactions, particularly those affecting the SH3/SH2 module or the myristoylation-dependent autoinhibition, have been associated with enhanced kinase activity and cellular transformation (aleem2015constitutiveactivityin pages 10-11, keersmaecker2008intrinsicdifferencesbetween pages 8-9, koleske2006mechanismsofactivation pages 9-10). This multifaceted regulatory complexity underpins both the physiological roles of ABL1 and its pathological contributions when misregulated.\n\n9.

Coordinates actin remodeling through tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins controlling cytoskeleton dynamics like MYH10 (involved in movement); CTTN (involved in signaling); or TUBA1 and TUBB (microtubule subunits). Binds directly F-actin and regulates actin cytoskeletal structure through its F-actin-bundling activity. Involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and motility through phosphorylation of key regulators of these processes such as CRK, CRKL, DOK1 or ARHGAP35. Adhesion-dependent phosphorylation of ARHGAP35 promotes its association with RASA1, resulting in recruitment of ARHGAP35 to the cell periphery where it inhibits RHO. Phosphorylates multiple receptor tyrosine kinases like PDGFRB and other substrates which are involved in endocytosis regulation such as RIN1. In brain, may regulate neurotransmission by phosphorylating proteins at the synapse. ABL2 also acts as a regulator of multiple pathological signaling cascades during infection. Pathogens can highjack ABL2 kinase signaling to reorganize the host actin cytoskeleton for multiple purposes, like facilitating intracellular movement and host cell exit. Finally, functions as its own regulator through autocatalytic activity as well as through phosphorylation of its inhibitor, ABI1. Positively regulates chemokine-mediated T-cell migration, polarization, and homing to lymph nodes and immune-challenged tissues, potentially via activation of NEDD9/HEF1 and RAP1 (By similarity)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny – ABL2 (also known as ARG) belongs to the Abl family of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases that are a distinct subgroup within the tyrosine kinome. ABL2 shares a close evolutionary relationship with ABL1 and is classified within the Src module (SrcM) subgroup in which members display a conserved SH3–SH2–kinase domain organization. Orthologs of ABL2 can be identified across mammalian species and other vertebrates, and its evolutionary origin dates back to the common ancestor of metazoans, similar to its paralog ABL1 (fabbro2015tenthingsyou pages 4-5, kwon2019tracingtheevolution pages 41-45).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed – ABL2 catalyzes the transfer of the γ-phosphate group from ATP to a tyrosine residue on protein substrates. In biochemical terms, its catalytic reaction is as follows: ATP + [protein]-tyrosine → ADP + [protein]-phosphotyrosine + H⁺ (fabbro2015tenthingsyou pages 22-23, tse2015moleculardeterminantsunderlying pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements – The kinase activity of ABL2 requires the presence of divalent metal ions as cofactors, with Mg²⁺ being essential for coordinating ATP binding and facilitating the phosphoryl transfer reaction (lund2013biotechapplicationsof pages 23-27).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity – ABL2 is a tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates target proteins on tyrosine residues. Its substrate specificity is defined by its recognition of motifs present on substrates involved in cytoskeletal regulation and receptor signaling. Identified substrates include proteins that control actin dynamics such as MYH10, cortactin (CTTN), and components of microtubules including TUBA1 and TUBB, as well as signaling adaptors such as CRK and CRKL (fabbro2015tenthingsyou pages 4-5, zh... identificationofksr1 pages 71-75). Although a detailed consensus sequence for ABL2 has not been explicitly established in the current context, its substrate recognition patterns are inferred to be similar to those found for other cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases that preferentially phosphorylate tyrosine residues within specific biochemical contexts (tse2015moleculardeterminantsunderlying pages 1-2, bhanumathy2021proteintyrosinekinases pages 2-4).\n\n5. Structure – ABL2 exhibits a modular domain structure characteristic of Abl family kinases. It contains an N-terminal region that includes Src homology 3 (SH3) and Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, followed by a well-conserved catalytic (kinase) domain. The kinase domain adopts the typical bilobed structure of eukaryotic protein kinases with an N-terminal lobe comprising a glycine-rich loop and a C-helix, and a larger C-terminal lobe containing the activation loop, catalytic loop, and motifs required for substrate binding and phosphoryl transfer. In addition, ABL2 possesses regions that mediate F-actin binding and bundling, which contribute to its role in cytoskeletal remodeling; these regions may be located within its C-terminal portion and can include intrinsically disordered segments that are critical for protein stability and regulation (hantschel2012structureregulationsignaling pages 1-2, rogers2021abelsonkinase’sintrinsically pages 26-26). Unique structural features include the presence of autoinhibitory interactions mediated by its SH3 and SH2 domains with the kinase domain and its direct binding to filamentous actin, which distinguishes it functionally from other tyrosine kinases (fabbro2015tenthingsyou pages 4-5, kwon2019tracingtheevolution pages 41-45).\n\n6. Regulation – ABL2 is subject to multiple layers of regulation that control its kinase activity and stability. Autophosphorylation in its activation loop leads to a conformational change that increases its catalytic activity. In its inactive state, intramolecular interactions involving its SH3 and SH2 domains help maintain an autoinhibited conformation, a mechanism that is conserved among Abl family kinases (hantschel2012structureregulationsignaling pages 1-2, kwon2019tracingtheevolution pages 32-37). Additionally, ABL2 regulates its own activity through autocatalytic phosphorylation as well as through phosphorylation of its inhibitory protein ABI1. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at key regulatory residues, modulate its interaction with cytoskeletal regulators and adaptor proteins. Furthermore, the kinase is regulated by its binding to F-actin, which not only localizes it to specific subcellular compartments but also modulates its activity in response to extracellular stimuli. Pathogens can hijack ABL2 signaling to reorganize the host actin cytoskeleton, indicating that regulatory pathways converging on ABL2 are critical for proper cellular function (fabbro2015tenthingsyou pages 22-23, hantschel2012structureregulationsignaling pages 2-3, rogers2021abelsonkinase’sintrinsically pages 1-2).\n\n7. Function – ABL2 functions primarily as a non-receptor tyrosine kinase with overlapping roles to ABL1 in controlling cell growth and survival. It plays a central role in cytoskeletal remodeling by phosphorylating proteins that regulate the actin and microtubule networks, such as MYH10, CTTN, TUBA1, and TUBB. Through these modifications, ABL2 regulates events including cell motility, adhesion, and receptor endocytosis. Moreover, ABL2 phosphorylates adaptor proteins such as CRK, CRKL, and DOK1, and modulates the activity of Rho regulatory proteins like ARHGAP35, influencing cell adhesion dynamics by controlling the localization of RASA1 and the inhibition of RHO signaling. In neuronal tissue, ABL2 may regulate neurotransmission at synapses. It is also implicated in pathological signaling cascades during infections, wherein pathogens exploit ABL2 signaling to reorganize the host cytoskeleton for intracellular movement and cell exit. Additionally, ABL2 positively regulates chemokine-mediated T-cell migration, polarization, and homing to lymph nodes and inflamed tissues, likely through activation of effectors such as NEDD9/HEF1 and RAP1 (fabbro2015tenthingsyou pages 4-5, hantschel2012structureregulationsignaling pages 3-4, bhanumathy2021proteintyrosinekinases pages 1-2).\n\n8. Other Comments – Several small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target Abl family kinases have been developed, including imatinib, ponatinib, dasatinib, and bosutinib. These inhibitors are used predominantly in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia and other cancers driven by dysregulated ABL kinase activity; although many studies focus on ABL1, similar pharmacological agents are being evaluated for broader activity against related kinases such as ABL2 (wong2004thebcrablstory pages 14-17, kim2017proteintyrosinesignaling pages 25-27). ABL2 is also a target of pathogen-mediated signaling, and its modulation may have implications for infectious disease as well as immune regulation. Notable disease associations for ABL2 include its involvement in oncogenic transformation and chemokine signaling processes that mediate T-cell migration. Functional mutations in Abl family kinases have been linked with drug resistance in cancer therapy, and although most well-characterized mutations are in ABL1, studies of resistance mechanisms often inform understanding of ABL2 function (hantschel2012structureregulationsignaling pages 5-6, tse2015moleculardeterminantsunderlying pages 2-3).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase CSK, also known as C‐Src kinase or protein‐tyrosine kinase CYL (Uniprot: P41240), is a non‐receptor tyrosine kinase that is evolutionarily conserved among metazoans and is a member of the classical protein kinase superfamily. CSK orthologs have been identified in mammals, and its regulatory function toward Src family kinases (SFKs) is maintained from lower eukaryotes to humans (chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 2-3, cole2003proteintyrosinekinases pages 1-2). Within the human kinome, CSK is grouped with cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases that, despite having domain architectures partially reminiscent of Src itself, diverge functionally in that CSK lacks autophosphorylation sites and membrane‐targeting acylation motifs, features that are typically present in SFKs (ia2010structuralelementsand pages 1-6, levinson2008structuralbasisfor pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCSK catalyzes the phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue located at the C-terminal regulatory tail of its substrate proteins, specifically those of the Src family. The chemical reaction follows the stoichiometry: ATP + [protein]-L-tyrosine → ADP + [protein]-L-tyrosine-phosphate + H⁺, thereby transferring the γ-phosphate from ATP to the hydroxyl group of a tyrosine residue, which induces a conformational change leading to inhibition of the target kinase (cole2003proteintyrosinekinases pages 1-2, chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 2-3).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of CSK, as with most protein tyrosine kinases, depends on the presence of divalent metal ions. In particular, Mg²⁺ is required to coordinate the ATP substrate and facilitate the phosphoryl transfer during the kinase reaction (cole2003proteintyrosinekinases pages 1-2, roskoski2004srcprotein–tyrosinekinase pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCSK exhibits a high degree of substrate specificity by targeting the conserved C-terminal regulatory tyrosine present in Src family kinases – a modification that triggers intramolecular binding between the phosphotyrosine and the SH2 domain in the substrate, resulting in its inactivation. CSK’s catalytic domain is geared to recognize elements beyond the local sequence, relying on remote docking interactions dictated by the overall architecture of the substrate, thereby ensuring that only the physiological full-length SFKs (such as LCK, SRC, HCK, FYN, LYN and YES1) are efficiently phosphorylated (chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 2-3, cole2003proteintyrosinekinases pages 2-3, levinson2008structuralbasisfor pages 1-2).\n\n5. Structure  \nCSK is composed of a modular architecture that includes an N-terminal SH3 domain, a central SH2 domain, and a C-terminal catalytic (kinase) domain. The SH3 domain is involved in mediating protein–protein interactions, while the SH2 domain binds to phosphotyrosine-containing motifs that can regulate CSK localization and influence its activity. The kinase domain exhibits a bilobal structure with a smaller N-terminal lobe that contains the characteristic β-sheet and an α-helix C, and a larger C-terminal lobe that provides the substrate-binding region and harbors key catalytic motifs such as the DFG motif, the catalytic loop including the conserved HRD sequence, and the salt bridge formed between Lys222 and Glu236, which is essential for proper ATP binding and orientation (ia2010structuralelementsand pages 43-48, roskoski2004srcprotein–tyrosinekinase pages 7-8). Unique structural aspects of CSK include the absence of autophorylation sites within its activation loop and the requirement for its regulatory SH2 and SH3 domains to induce a catalytically competent conformation; in fact, the isolated kinase domain is intrinsically inactive until proper intramolecular interactions occur, underscoring the importance of cooperative domain–domain contacts (huang2010structurefunctionstudiesof pages 21-27, ia2010structuralelementsand pages 50-52).\n\n6. Regulation  \nCSK is regulated through a combination of allosteric domain interactions and post-translational modifications. Its activity is modulated by conformational changes that are induced when its SH2 domain binds phosphorylated docking proteins, such as transmembrane adaptor proteins (e.g., Cbp/PAG-1), which recruit CSK to the plasma membrane where its substrates are localized (zhu2023regulationtargetsand pages 1-2, fortner2022apoptosisregulationby pages 2-4). Additionally, phosphorylation of CSK at serine-364 by PKA and phosphorylation at tyrosine-18 by ACK1 have been reported to enhance its catalytic activity, thereby promoting the efficient phosphorylation and consequent inhibition of Src family kinases (fortner2022apoptosisregulationby pages 2-4, zhu2023regulationtargetsand pages 2-3). These regulatory events, in conjunction with potential SUMOylation and interactions with protein tyrosine phosphatases, contribute to the fine-tuning of CSK’s activity in various signaling environments (ia2010structuralelementsand pages 48-50, selzer2024allostericmodulationof pages 39-42).\n\n7. Function  \nCSK plays a pivotal role as a negative regulator of Src family kinases, which are critical mediators of cell growth, differentiation, migration, and immune responses. By phosphorylating the C-terminal regulatory tyrosine on SFKs, CSK induces an intramolecular binding event between the phosphorylated tail and the SH2 domain of the SFK, thereby locking the kinase in an inactive conformation and suppressing its downstream signaling (chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 2-3, fortner2022apoptosisregulationby pages 1-2). This inhibitory mechanism is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis, as unrestricted SFK activity can lead to aberrant signaling associated with oncogenesis. CSK is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues and is recruited to the plasma membrane by binding to specific transmembrane or adaptor proteins. In the context of immune receptor signaling, CSK suppresses T-cell receptor (TCR) and B-cell receptor (BCR) mediated responses by inhibiting positive effectors such as FYN and LCK, thereby playing an important role in modulating immune cell activation (zhu2023regulationtargetsand pages 1-2, ingley2008srcfamilykinases pages 1-2).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral small molecule inhibitors and peptide-based approaches have been explored to modulate tyrosine kinase signaling pathways, and although much of the inhibitor development has focused on targeting active SFKs, a detailed understanding of CSK’s unique regulatory and catalytic mechanisms offers the potential for the development of selective CSK modulators. Alterations in CSK expression or function are implicated in various pathological states, including cancer, where loss or reduction in CSK-mediated negative regulation may contribute to oncogenic Src activation. Furthermore, CSK’s interplay with its homolog CHK, which can also inhibit Src family kinases albeit with different tissue distribution and binding characteristics, presents further avenues for therapeutic exploration (roskoski2004srcprotein–tyrosinekinase pages 8-9, zhu2023regulationtargetsand pages 2-3).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nMegakaryocyte‐associated tyrosine‐protein kinase (MATK), also known as CSK homologous kinase, HYL, CTK or hematopoietic consensus tyrosine‐lacking kinase, belongs to the Csk family of non‐receptor protein tyrosine kinases that share evolutionary relationships with C-terminal Src kinase (CSK) and other related kinases involved in the regulation of Src-family members (advani2017cskhomologouskinase(chk) pages 1-2). Orthologs of MATK can be identified in vertebrate species where the kinase is preferentially expressed in hematopoietic and certain neural tissues, and its gene has been mapped to regions such as human chromosome 19q13.3, confirming its evolutionary conservation within the vertebrate kinome (grgurevich1997thecsklikeproteins pages 1-3, grgurevich1997thecsklikeproteins pages 3-4). MATK is classified as a member of the Csk homologous kinase family, which is part of the broader Src regulatory network that emerged early in evolution from a common metazoan ancestor, as supported by analyses of the human kinome and evolutionary studies on protein kinase signaling (chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 9-10).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nMATK catalyzes the transfer of the γ-phosphate from ATP to the hydroxyl group of tyrosine residues present on its substrate proteins; in particular, the reaction is directed toward the C-terminal regulatory tyrosine residue on Src-family kinases that, when phosphorylated, leads to their negative regulation (advani2017cskhomologouskinase(chk) pages 20-21). In biochemical terms, the catalytic reaction can be summarized as:  \n  ATP + [protein]-tyrosine → ADP + [protein]-phosphotyrosine + H⁺ (ayrapetov2006structuralandfunctional pages 65-68).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of MATK, like that of other protein tyrosine kinases, is dependent on the presence of divalent cations. In vitro studies and general kinase biochemistry indicate that Mg²⁺ is required as a cofactor to facilitate the binding of ATP to the kinase active site and to promote the phosphoryl transfer reaction (sun2023dissectionofthe pages 10-10, chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nMATK exhibits substrate specificity directed toward Src-family kinases by phosphorylating their C-terminal regulatory tyrosine residue—a modification that imposes a conformational change resulting in the attenuation of their catalytic activity. The enzyme recognizes protein substrates through specific interactions mediated primarily by its regulatory domains; hence, the consensus substrate motif includes a phosphoacceptor tyrosine located in a context that allows docking by the kinase’s recognition modules (advani2017cskhomologouskinase(chk) pages 20-21, chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 9-10).\n\n5. Structure  \nMATK is organized in a modular fashion typical for the Csk family of kinases. Its primary structure comprises a central catalytic (kinase) domain that is flanked by regulatory domains, including an N-terminal SH3 domain and an SH2 domain. The SH3 domain contributes to mediating protein–protein interactions by binding to proline-rich motifs, while the SH2 domain recognizes phosphotyrosine-containing sequences on target proteins and adaptor molecules (advani2017cskhomologouskinase(chk) pages 20-21, superti‐furga1995structure‐functionrelationshipsin pages 5-6). The kinase domain contains the canonical ATP-binding pocket with a glycine-rich loop, a critical lysine residue necessary for ATP coordination, an activation loop that is subject to regulatory phosphorylation, and structural elements such as the C-helix and hydrophobic spines that are essential for catalysis (ayrapetov2006structuralandfunctional pages 65-68). Unique structural features of MATK compared with CSK include a diminished catalytic rate for phosphorylation of its primary substrate, which has been attributed to differences in key residue composition within the catalytic domain, while maintaining high-affinity binding to Src-family kinases. Such variations within the SH2 and SH3 modules also contribute to its specialized functional role (advani2017cskhomologouskinase(chk) pages 20-21).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulatory mechanisms governing MATK activity include both post-translational modifications and protein–protein interactions. MATK is regulated by phosphorylation events; however, unlike CSK, it functions primarily as an efficient inhibitor of Src-family kinases by binding with high affinity rather than by robust catalytic activity toward the C-terminal regulatory tyrosine residue (advani2017cskhomologouskinase(chk) pages 1-2). In hematopoietic cells, MATK expression is inducible by cytokines such as stem cell factor (SCF), which increases both its mRNA and protein levels in megakaryoblastic cell lines, indicating transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms (grgurevich1997thecsklikeproteins pages 9-11). Additionally, MATK is regulated through intramolecular domain dynamics and conformational changes that involve its SH2 and SH3 domains; these domains facilitate interactions with phosphoprotein partners and adaptor proteins that contribute to membrane recruitment and allosteric activation or inhibition (hirao1997translocationofthe pages 1-2, chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 5-6).\n\n7. Function  \nMATK plays a significant biological role in the signal transduction pathways of hematopoietic cells, as well as in certain areas of the brain. Its primary function is to negatively regulate Src-family kinase activity by phosphorylating the C-terminal regulatory tyrosine, thereby maintaining Src kinases in their inactive conformation. This inhibitory function is critical in controlling T-cell proliferation as well as modulating other aspects of immune cell signaling, and it may also participate in the regulation of cell adhesion and proliferation in various hematopoietic lineages (advani2017cskhomologouskinase(chk) pages 1-2, chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 9-10). The differential expression pattern of MATK—with heightened levels in leukocytes and brain tissue compared to the ubiquitous expression of CSK—supports its specialized role in cell type-specific signal modulation (advani2017cskhomologouskinase(chk) pages 1-2, ayrapetov2006structuralandfunctional pages 42-45).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nUnlike CSK, which robustly phosphorylates Src-family kinases, MATK displays a relatively low catalytic turnover while compensating with high-affinity non-catalytic binding to its substrates, a characteristic that underscores its distinct inhibitory mechanism (advani2017cskhomologouskinase(chk) pages 20-21, chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 1-2). No specific pharmacological inhibitors selective for MATK have been reported in the available literature, although its regulatory effect on Src-family kinases and its involvement in oncogenic signaling pathways—such as those observed in colon and breast cancers—suggest that MATK may represent a potential therapeutic target. In addition, while mutations directly associated with MATK have not been prominently documented in the context provided, its role in maintaining proper Src-family kinase regulation implies that loss or dysregulation of MATK function may contribute to pathological conditions related to abnormal kinase activity (hirao1997translocationofthe pages 9-10).\n\n9.

MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1 are the 2 MAPKs which play an important role in the MAPK/ERK cascade. They participate also in a signaling cascade initiated by activated KIT and KITLG/SCF. Depending on the cellular context, the MAPK/ERK cascade mediates diverse biological functions such as cell growth, adhesion, survival and differentiation through the regulation of transcription, translation, cytoskeletal rearrangements. The MAPK/ERK cascade also plays a role in initiation and regulation of meiosis, mitosis, and postmitotic functions in differentiated cells by phosphorylating a number of transcription factors. About 160 substrates have already been discovered for ERKs. Many of these substrates are localized in the nucleus, and seem to participate in the regulation of transcription upon stimulation. However, other substrates are found in the cytosol as well as in other cellular organelles, and those are responsible for processes such as translation, mitosis and apoptosis. Moreover, the MAPK/ERK cascade is also involved in the regulation of the endosomal dynamics, including lysosome processing and endosome cycling through the perinuclear recycling compartment (PNRC); as well as in the fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus during mitosis. The substrates include transcription factors (such as ATF2, BCL6, ELK1, ERF, FOS, HSF4 or SPZ1), cytoskeletal elements (such as CANX, CTTN, GJA1, MAP2, MAPT, PXN, SORBS3 or STMN1), regulators of apoptosis (such as BAD, BTG2, CASP9, DAPK1, IER3, MCL1 or PPARG), regulators of translation (such as EIF4EBP1 and FXR1) and a variety of other signaling-related molecules (like ARHGEF2, DCC, FRS2 or GRB10). Protein kinases (such as RAF1, RPS6KA1/RSK1, RPS6KA3/RSK2, RPS6KA2/RSK3, RPS6KA6/RSK4, SYK, MKNK1/MNK1, MKNK2/MNK2, RPS6KA5/MSK1, RPS6KA4/MSK2, MAPKAPK3 or MAPKAPK5) and phosphatases (such as DUSP1, DUSP4, DUSP6 or DUSP16) are other substrates which enable the propagation the MAPK/ERK signal to additional cytosolic and nuclear targets, thereby extending the specificity of the cascade. Mediates phosphorylation of TPR in response to EGF stimulation. May play a role in the spindle assembly checkpoint. Phosphorylates PML and promotes its interaction with PIN1, leading to PML degradation. Phosphorylates CDK2AP2 (By similarity). Phosphorylates phosphoglycerate kinase PGK1 under hypoxic conditions to promote its targeting to the mitochondrion and suppress the formation of acetyl-coenzyme A from pyruvate (PubMed:26942675)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nMitogen‐activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1), also known as ERK2, belongs to the evolutionarily conserved MAP kinase family, which is a subgroup of the CMGC kinase superfamily that includes CDKs, MAPKs, GSK3, and CLK kinases (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 2-4). Orthologs of MAPK1/ERK2 have been identified in organisms as diverse as yeast, plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates, indicating that its core signaling role was established before the divergence of major eukaryotic lineages (rousseau2009caractérisationdela pages 29-33). MAPK1/ERK2 is phylogenetically related to ERK1 (MAPK3), which arose from a gene duplication event in bony vertebrates, with ERK2 typically being more evolutionarily conserved and often more abundantly expressed in key tissues such as brain, heart, and skeletal muscle (al2015identificationofnovel pages 13-16, martinvega2023navigatingtheerk12 pages 5-7). Its classification within the human kinome follows the organization provided by seminal studies such as those by Manning et al., situating ERK2 as a member of the conventional MAPKs that are critical for signal transduction in basic cellular processes (baljuls2009differencesandsimilarities pages 162-164).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nMAPK1/ERK2 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to specific serine or threonine residues within substrate proteins, generating adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and a phosphorylated protein, with the concomitant release of a proton (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 2-4). This phosphorylation reaction is central to signal transduction, where it modulates the activity, localization, or stability of substrates that include transcription factors, kinases, and various regulatory proteins (machne2006modelingofthe pages 9-12). The enzymatic activity is highly specific for serine/threonine residues followed immediately by a proline (S/T-P), a property that is critical for the fidelity of downstream signaling responses (kirsch2021noncanonicalinteractionsof pages 94-97).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of MAPK1/ERK2 requires the presence of divalent cations, with magnesium (Mg²⁺) being the primary cofactor that facilitates ATP binding and proper positioning of phosphate groups during the phosphoryl transfer reaction (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 2-4, machneUnknownyearmodelingofthe pages 6-9). Mg²⁺ ions are essential for stabilizing the negative charges on the ATP molecule and thereby enhancing kinase activity (rousseau2009caractérisationdela pages 29-33).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nMAPK1/ERK2 exhibits strict substrate specificity characterized by its preference for phosphorylating serine or threonine residues that precede a proline residue in substrate targets, thus recognizing motifs typically denoted as S/T-P (kirsch2021noncanonicalinteractionsof pages 94-97). In addition, substrate binding is facilitated by the presence of docking domains on ERK2 that interact with complementary D-domain or DEF motif sequences present in its substrates, thereby helping to ensure both specificity and efficient phosphorylation (martinvega2023navigatingtheerk12 pages 30-32, martinvega2023navigatingtheerk12 pages 32-33). This proline-directed specificity is a common feature among MAP kinases, which distinguishes them from other serine/threonine kinases (lai2015investigationsofthe pages 1-6).\n\n5. Structure  \nMAPK1/ERK2 possesses a bilobal kinase domain that is typical of eukaryotic protein kinases, with a smaller N-terminal lobe composed mainly of β-strands and a larger C-terminal lobe enriched in α-helices (novak2021impactoferk2 pages 12-18). The active site is located in the cleft between these lobes and contains several highly conserved motifs such as the glycine-rich loop (GxGxxG) that is critical for ATP binding, the catalytic HRD motif essential for phosphoryl transfer, and the DFG motif that coordinates Mg²⁺ ions (rousseau2009caractérisationdela pages 29-33, honzejkova2024structuralstudiesof pages 15-20). A defining structural feature of ERK2 is its activation loop, which includes a conserved TEY motif (threonine-glutamate-tyrosine); dual phosphorylation of the threonine and tyrosine residues within this motif is necessary to trigger a conformational change that leads to full activation of the kinase (lai2016regulatoryrolesof pages 12-14, roux2004erkandp38 pages 3-4). Additionally, ERK2 contains distinct docking sites such as the D-recruitment site (DRS) and the F-recruitment site (FRS), which mediate interactions with substrates and regulatory proteins, thereby ensuring proper substrate alignment and specificity (martinvega2023navigatingtheerk12 pages 33-34, orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 38-41). The overall three-dimensional architecture of ERK2 has been well characterized by X-ray crystallography and high-resolution structural studies, revealing a dynamic enzyme that undergoes significant conformational changes upon activation (novak2021impactoferk2 pages 12-18, kirsch2021noncanonicalinteractionsof pages 4-7).\n\n6. Regulation  \nActivation of MAPK1/ERK2 occurs via dual phosphorylation of the TEY motif within its activation loop, a process performed by the dual-specificity kinases MEK1 and MEK2 following stimulation by upstream effectors such as Ras and Raf (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 2-4, lai2015investigationsofthe pages 55-60). This phosphorylation induces a conformational change that aligns critical catalytic residues and opens the substrate-binding pocket, thereby increasing the enzymatic activity by up to 1000-fold (rousseau2009caractérisationdela pages 90-94, martinvega2023navigatingtheerk12 pages 66-71). Regulatory mechanisms also include interactions with scaffolding proteins that bring ERK2 into close proximity with its activators and substrates, enhancing both the specificity and efficiency of signal transduction (martinvega2023navigatingtheerk12 pages 13-14, kirsch2021noncanonicalinteractionsof pages 94-97). An additional layer of regulation is provided by dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs), such as DUSP1, DUSP4, and DUSP6, which dephosphorylate the activation loop of ERK2, thereby attenuating its activity and contributing to signaling termination (sladecek2016insearchof pages 70-73, sladecek2016insearchof pages 77-81). Furthermore, feedback phosphorylation mechanisms, including ERK2-mediated phosphorylation of its upstream regulators and interacting partners, contribute to dynamic control of the MAPK cascade and fine-tune the cellular response (lai2016regulatoryrolesof pages 12-14, martinvega2023navigatingtheerk12 pages 7-8).\n\n7. Function  \nMAPK1/ERK2 plays an essential role in the MAPK/ERK signaling cascade by mediating diverse cellular responses such as cell growth, adhesion, survival, and differentiation (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 2-4, martinvega2023navigatingtheerk12 pages 7-8). ERK2 phosphorylates a wide array of substrates, including transcription factors like ELK1, ATF2, FOS, and BCL6; cytoskeletal proteins such as paxillin and MAP2; and regulators of apoptosis, translation, and additional signaling kinases, thereby acting as a central node in the relay of extracellular signals (kirsch2021noncanonicalinteractionsof pages 94-97, rousseau2009caractérisationdela pages 29-33). Owing to its ability to translocate into the nucleus upon activation, ERK2 modulates gene expression programs that control cell cycle progression and differentiation during both development and in the adult organism (martinvega2023navigatingtheerk12 pages 33-34, rousseau2009caractérisationdela pages 78-80). In addition to its well-established role in mitogenic signaling via growth factor receptors such as EGFR and KIT, ERK2 participates in non-canonical signaling pathways that impact endosomal dynamics, Golgi fragmentation during mitosis, and the regulation of spindle assembly checkpoints in dividing cells (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 2-4, al2015identificationofnovel pages 19-23). Furthermore, by phosphorylating substrates involved in transcription, such as members of the FOS family and other transcription regulators, ERK2 facilitates the rapid modulation of gene expression in response to external stimuli (martinvega2023navigatingtheerk12 pages 32-33, rousseau2009caractérisationdela pages 33-37).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nAmong the notable characteristics of MAPK1/ERK2 is its central role as an effector in the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling axis, which has made it an important target for drug development in oncology and other proliferative disorders (novak2021impactoferk2 pages 50-55, orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 25-29). Several small molecule inhibitors have been developed that target the ATP-binding site or the docking interfaces of ERK2, and these compounds are in various stages of preclinical and clinical development (roux2004erkandp38 pages 5-7, sladecek2016insearchof pages 70-73). Moreover, dysregulation of ERK2 signaling has been implicated in a range of diseases, including various cancers, developmental syndromes, and neurodegenerative disorders, with mutations or altered expression levels contributing to aberrant cell proliferation and survival (novak2021impactoferk2 pages 18-23, rousseau2009caractérisationdela pages 78-80). In addition, ERK2 is known to phosphorylate key regulators in metabolic pathways, such as phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK1) under hypoxic conditions, thereby linking its activity to metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 2-4). The extensive catalog of approximately 160 substrates for ERK2 further underscores its ability to integrate multiple signaling inputs and coordinate a broad spectrum of cellular processes (kirsch2021noncanonicalinteractionsof pages 94-97). Furthermore, experimental data indicate that additional regulatory mechanisms, including protein–protein interactions with scaffold proteins and modulation by dual specificity phosphatases, are critical for achieving spatio-temporal precision in ERK2 signal transduction (martinvega2023navigatingtheerk12 pages 5-7, orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 33-38). These features not only underscore the biological importance of ERK2 but also highlight its viability as a therapeutic target, particularly in conditions where its regulation is compromised (rousseau2009caractérisationdela pages 90-94, sladecek2016insearchof pages 77-81).\n\n9.

MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1 are the 2 MAPKs which play an important role in the MAPK/ERK cascade. They participate also in a signaling cascade initiated by activated KIT and KITLG/SCF. Depending on the cellular context, the MAPK/ERK cascade mediates diverse biological functions such as cell growth, adhesion, survival and differentiation through the regulation of transcription, translation, cytoskeletal rearrangements. The MAPK/ERK cascade also plays a role in initiation and regulation of meiosis, mitosis, and postmitotic functions in differentiated cells by phosphorylating a number of transcription factors. About 160 substrates have already been discovered for ERKs. Many of these substrates are localized in the nucleus, and seem to participate in the regulation of transcription upon stimulation. However, other substrates are found in the cytosol as well as in other cellular organelles, and those are responsible for processes such as translation, mitosis and apoptosis. Moreover, the MAPK/ERK cascade is also involved in the regulation of the endosomal dynamics, including lysosome processing and endosome cycling through the perinuclear recycling compartment (PNRC); as well as in the fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus during mitosis. The substrates include transcription factors (such as ATF2, BCL6, ELK1, ERF, FOS, HSF4 or SPZ1), cytoskeletal elements (such as CANX, CTTN, GJA1, MAP2, MAPT, PXN, SORBS3 or STMN1), regulators of apoptosis (such as BAD, BTG2, CASP9, DAPK1, IER3, MCL1 or PPARG), regulators of translation (such as EIF4EBP1) and a variety of other signaling-related molecules (like ARHGEF2, DEPTOR, FRS2 or GRB10) (PubMed:35216969).

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nMAPK3, commonly known as ERK1, is a member of the extracellular signal‐regulated kinase (ERK) subgroup within the larger mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) family. ERK1/2 kinases share high sequence conservation among vertebrates and are present in all mammalian species, reflecting their evolution from a common eukaryotic ancestor (roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 1-2, kultz1998phylogeneticandfunctional pages 1-2). Phylogenetic analyses place MAPK3/ERK1 in a distinct clade within the MAPK superfamily that is associated with mitogenic signaling and substrate phosphorylation patterns that are conserved across species from yeast to mammals (kultz1998phylogeneticandfunctional pages 2-3, roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 2-2). Within the kinome, ERK1 is closely related to ERK2, with both isoforms sharing an 84% sequence identity; however, ERK1 possesses a unique N-terminal extension (a 17 amino acid insertion) that distinguishes it from ERK2 (roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 4-5). This subgroup is part of the detailed evolutionary landscape of MAP kinases described in seminal works by Manning et al. that tracked the origins of protein kinase families from the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) (roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 1-2, kultz1998phylogeneticandfunctional pages 3-4).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nMAPK3/ERK1 catalyzes a classical phosphorylation reaction in which the γ‐phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is transferred to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins. The chemical reaction can be represented as follows:  \nATP + [protein]–(L‑serine or L‑threonine) → ADP + [protein]–(L‑serine/threonine)‑phosphate + H⁺ (roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of MAPK3/ERK1 is dependent on the presence of divalent cations. Mg²⁺ is required as a cofactor to coordinate ATP binding within the catalytic cleft, thereby facilitating phosphoryl transfer to its substrate proteins (roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 6-8).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nMAPK3/ERK1 exhibits a strong substrate preference for serine/threonine residues that are immediately followed by a proline residue. This substrate specificity is largely dictated by the structural constraints of the kinase active site and is enhanced through docking interactions with substrates that display additional docking motifs. Specifically, many substrates contain a Pro-Xxx-Ser/Thr-Pro motif and also harbor either D-site (docking site) or F-site motifs, which bind to corresponding recruitment sites on ERK1 to stabilize enzyme–substrate interactions (roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 11-12, kultz1998phylogeneticandfunctional pages 9-12). This specificity ensures that ERK1 phosphorylates a wide repertoire of downstream targets – over 160 have been characterized – and is integral to the regulation of diverse cellular processes (old2009functionalproteomicsidentifies pages 3-4).\n\n5. Structure  \nMAPK3/ERK1 contains a central catalytic kinase domain that is organized into a smaller N-terminal lobe and a larger C-terminal lobe. The N-terminal lobe typically comprises a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and a conserved C-helix, whereas the C-terminal lobe is predominantly α-helical and houses the substrate and ATP-binding sites (roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 4-5, roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 8-9).  \nA key structural feature is the activation loop (or T-loop) that contains the canonical dual phosphorylation motif, typically denoted as TEY (threonine-glutamate-tyrosine) for ERK1. Dual phosphorylation at the threonine and tyrosine residues within this motif, catalyzed by upstream kinases MEK1/2, induces a conformational shift—from an open, inactive state to a closed, active configuration—thus forming properly aligned hydrophobic regulatory (R) and catalytic (C) spines that are essential for enzymatic activity (roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 8-9, roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 9-10).  \nAdditional regulatory docking regions are present on ERK1, including the D-site recruitment site (DRS) and the F-site recruitment site (FRS), which mediate binding to substrates exhibiting complementary docking motifs. These features, combined with the characteristic ATP-binding cleft (which relies on hinge region interactions for the formation of hydrogen bonds with the inhibitor or nucleotide), define the overall fold and catalytic mechanism of the kinase (roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 14-15, roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 28-29). Moreover, a unique N-terminal extension in ERK1, relative to ERK2, may confer specific regulatory or spatial properties, although both share the core catalytic architecture (roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 4-5).\n\n6. Regulation  \nMAPK3/ERK1 activity is intricately regulated by multiple mechanisms that ensure controlled signal transduction. The primary mode of activation is through dual phosphorylation of the TEY activation motif on the T-loop by the upstream kinases MEK1/2. This phosphorylation event is essential for the transition from an inactive to an active kinase conformation and significantly increases catalytic activity (roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 1-2, roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 5-6).  \nBeyond the TEY motif, ERK1 exhibits additional regulatory phosphorylation sites within the T-loop, notably threonine 207 (T207) and tyrosine 210 (Y210), which have been shown to play roles in modulating kinase activity through autoinhibitory mechanisms. Experimental mutagenesis studies indicate that phosphorylation at T207 can inhibit substrate phosphorylation, thereby contributing to a negative feedback mechanism that limits ERK1 signaling duration (lai2016regulatoryrolesof pages 7-9, lai2016regulatoryrolesof pages 9-12).  \nRegulatory control is also exerted via protein–protein interactions with scaffold proteins such as KSR1/2 and IQGAP1. These scaffolds facilitate the assembly of the Raf-MEK-ERK cascade, thereby enhancing signal propagation and providing spatial and temporal regulation of kinase activity (roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 15-16). In addition, ERK1 activity is attenuated by dephosphorylation events mediated by dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) including DUSP6/MKP3, which specifically recognize and deactivate ERK1 by removing phosphate groups from both the threonine and tyrosine residues in the activation loop (roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 23-24, roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 24-26). Furthermore, regulatory mechanisms such as nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling, which involves specific nuclear localization factors and interactions with nucleoporins, ensure that ERK1 is localized appropriately to phosphorylate either cytosolic or nuclear substrates depending on the cellular context (roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 26-27, roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 37-38).\n\n7. Function  \nMAPK3/ERK1 is a central serine/threonine kinase that operates as a critical effector in the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling cascade. This pathway is initiated by the activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), such as KIT through binding to its ligand KITLG/SCF, which then engage the small GTPase Ras and its downstream effector Raf kinases. Activated Raf phosphorylates MEK1/2, which in turn activate ERK1 via dual phosphorylation of the TEY motif (roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 5-6, roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 1-2). Once active, ERK1 phosphorylates a broad array of substrates – estimated at over 160 – that include transcription factors (e.g., ATF2, ELK1, FOS), components of the cytoskeleton (e.g., MAPT, CTTN, PXN), regulators of apoptosis (e.g., BAD, CASP9), and proteins involved in translation (e.g., EIF4EBP1) (roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 1-2, roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 35-36).  \nIn the nucleus, ERK1-mediated phosphorylation of transcription factors promotes the induction of immediate early genes that govern cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. In the cytoplasm, ERK1 targets substrates that orchestrate processes such as cell adhesion, migration, and mitosis, as well as organelle dynamics involved in lysosomal processing and endosomal cycling through the perinuclear recycling compartment (PNRC) (roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 35-36, roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 37-38). Additionally, ERK1 signaling is essential in the regulation of cell cycle transitions including the initiation of meiosis and mitosis, with its substrates participating in key checkpoint controls and cytoskeletal rearrangements necessary for successful cell division (old2009functionalproteomicsidentifies pages 3-4, roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 5-6). The ubiquitous expression of ERK1 in various cell types underscores its role as a fundamental mediator in essential signaling pathways that govern both proliferative and cell-differentiation processes (roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 1-2).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nMAPK3/ERK1 is a clinically significant target due to its frequent involvement in oncogenic signaling pathways. Aberrant activation of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK cascade, often through mutations in upstream regulators such as KRAS or BRAF (e.g., BRAFV600E), drives persistent ERK1 activation in a variety of cancers, including melanoma, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers (roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 6-8, old2009functionalproteomicsidentifies pages 5-7). Inhibitor development has originally focused on ATP-competitive compounds, with additional classes emerging that target allosteric sites or disrupt ERK1 interactions with its substrates via the D-site or F-site docking regions (roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 29-30, huang2021chemoproteomicprofilingof pages 7-9). Although no single inhibitor is completely specific for ERK1 over its closely related isoform ERK2, several compounds (e.g., FR180204) have demonstrated potency in preclinical models by reducing aberrant phosphorylation events downstream of the ERK cascade (roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 28-29). Disease associations extend beyond cancer; dysregulation of ERK1 activity has also been implicated in conditions affecting the cell cycle, inflammatory responses, and neurodegeneration. Recent computational studies analyzing the structural impacts of missense mutations highlight that alterations near the ATP-binding region or activation loop can compromise ERK1 stability and catalytic function, further emphasizing the therapeutic importance of structure-based inhibitor design (rodrigues2025exploringtheeffects pages 1-2).  \nFurthermore, MAPK3/ERK1 is known to participate in feedback regulatory loops mediated by specific phosphatases such as DUSP6/MKP3, ensuring that its activity is appropriately dampened following mitogenic stimulation (roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 23-24). The integrated network of scaffold proteins, upstream kinases, and downstream substrates positions ERK1 as an indispensable regulator of both acute and chronic cellular responses to external stimuli (roskoski2012erk12mapkinases pages 15-16).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nMAPK4 (also known as ERK4 or PRKM4) is classified as an atypical member of the mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) family. Unlike conventional MAPKs such as ERK1/2, which are activated by a three‐tiered kinase cascade and share a conserved Thr–X–Tyr activation motif, MAPK4 belongs to a subfamily that includes ERK3 and is found in both vertebrates and invertebrates (al2015identificationofnovela pages 19-23, al2015identificationofnovelb pages 19-23). Within the overall phylogenetic grouping of protein kinases, MAPK4 is placed into the atypical MAPK branch, which is distinguished by its unique activation loop sequence and structural features. This subfamily shows approximately 73% identity in the kinase domain when comparing ERK3 and ERK4, yet both differ substantially from the classical MAPKs in sequence and domain organization (al2015identificationofnovelc pages 19-23, rousseau2009caractérisationdela pages 55-59).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nMAPK4 catalyzes the phosphorylation of serine/threonine residues on target substrates using ATP as a phosphate donor. The general reaction can be represented as: ATP + [protein] – (L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein] – (L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of MAPK4 requires the presence of divalent metal ions, most notably Mg²⁺, which facilitates the binding of ATP and supports phosphoryl transfer during the reaction (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 2-4).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nMAPK4 exhibits substrate specificity that is distinct from conventional MAPKs. Unlike kinases that target substrates via the classic Thr–X–Tyr motif recognition, MAPK4 contains a single phospho-acceptor site within a Ser-Glu-Gly (SEG) activation loop motif and an unusual Ser-Pro-Arg (SPR) sequence in subdomain VIII; these unique features underpin its selective substrate recognition profile (al2015identificationofnovela pages 19-23, coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2). Its well-documented substrates include microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and MAPK-activated protein kinase 5 (MK5), with substrate phosphorylation events being mediated by specific docking interactions that diverge from the D-domain interactions typically utilized by ERK1/2 (al2015identificationofnoveld pages 19-23, cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 9-10). The precise consensus motif for substrate phosphorylation by MAPK4 is not fully defined in the current literature; however, its restricted spectrum of substrates suggests that its recognition determinants are embedded within its atypical activation loop and associated docking regions (barbagallo2018exploringtheroles pages 15-19).\n\n5. Structure  \nMAPK4 is a 587-amino acid protein with an approximate molecular weight of 70 kDa. Its structural organization is characterized by a catalytic kinase domain located at the N-terminal region, which shares about 73% identity with that of its close atypical MAPK relative, ERK3 (al2015identificationofnovelc pages 19-23). Unlike conventional MAPKs that contain the conserved Thr–X–Tyr activation motif, MAPK4 displays a unique activation loop with a single phospho-acceptor serine within an S-E-G motif. Moreover, in subdomain VIII of its kinase domain, the usual Ala–Pro–Glu (APE) sequence is replaced by a Ser–Pro–Arg (SPR) motif, with the presence of an arginine at a position where most human kinases feature a conserved glutamic acid (coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 2-4, barbagallo2018exploringtherolesa pages 15-19). The enzyme also has a considerably extended C-terminal region relative to conventional MAPKs; however, the specific function of this extension in MAPK4 remains less clearly defined. Structural models, based on homology with available ERK templates and AlphaFold predictions, suggest that the unique alterations in the activation loop and SPR motif may influence both the conformation of the catalytic site and the organization of substrate docking surfaces (al2015identificationofnovelb pages 19-23, mathien2016identificationdescomposantes pages 35-38).\n\n6. Regulation  \nMAPK4 regulation occurs predominantly through phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms. A critical regulatory event is the phosphorylation of the serine residue within its activation loop (Ser-186 in MAPK4), which is necessary for its catalytic activity and efficient substrate interaction (al2015identificationofnovel pages 19-23, kant2006characterizationofthe pages 2-3). This activation loop phosphorylation is constitutive and is mediated by group I p21-activated kinases (PAKs), rather than by dual-specificity MAP kinase kinases (MAP2Ks) as observed in conventional MAPKs (almahi2013theregulationof pages 19-23, aberg2006regulationofmapkactivated pages 9-10). Additionally, the formation of a complex with MAPK-activated protein kinase 5 (MK5) leads to reciprocal phosphorylation events; phosphorylation of MAPK4 promotes the activation of MK5, and in turn, MK5 is also involved in further phosphorylating MAPK4 via feedback mechanisms (al2015identificationofnoveld pages 19-23, cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 9-10). These phosphorylation events not only modulate the intrinsic kinase activity of MAPK4 but also influence its subcellular localization by stabilizing interactions with downstream partner proteins (rousseau2009caractérisationdela pages 90-94, kant2006characterizationofthe pages 1-2).\n\n7. Function  \nMAPK4 functions as an atypical MAP kinase with defined roles in phosphorylating specific substrates involved in cytoskeletal rearrangement and cell-cycle regulation. Its documented substrates include microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and MAPKAPK5. The phosphorylation of MAP2 may be linked to cytoskeletal regulation, whereas the interplay with MK5 suggests a role in mediating signal transduction events that could promote cell cycle entry (al2015identificationofnovelc pages 19-23, kant2006characterizationofthe pages 2-3). Although the precise biological role of the MAPK4-MK5 complex remains incompletely defined, its ability to undergo reciprocal phosphorylation implies involvement in a regulatory loop that modulates kinase activity and potentially impacts cellular processes such as proliferation (al2015identificationofnovel pages 19-23, barbagallo2018exploringtheroles pages 15-19). Tissue-specific expression data indicate that, like many MAPKs, MAPK4 may exhibit differential expression across cell types; however, explicit details on its expression patterns are not extensively reported in the available literature (rousseau2009caractérisationdela pages 55-59).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nOwing to its atypical sequence features and distinct regulatory mechanisms, MAPK4 has not been as extensively characterized as conventional MAPKs, and its detailed substrate consensus motif remains to be fully elucidated (coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 9-10, thun2012theroleof pages 33-37). No specific inhibitors targeting MAPK4 have been firmly established, and its disease associations, although of potential interest given its role in cell cycle regulation and cytoskeletal dynamics, are not yet clearly defined in the literature (dahm2025atypicalmapksin pages 1-3, oleaflores2019extracellularsignalregulatedkinase pages 6-7).\n\n9.

Phosphorylates microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and MAPKAPK5. The precise role of the complex formed with MAPKAPK5 is still unclear, but the complex follows a complex set of phosphorylation events: upon interaction with atypical MAPKAPK5, ERK3/MAPK6 is phosphorylated at Ser-189 and then mediates phosphorylation and activation of MAPKAPK5, which in turn phosphorylates ERK3/MAPK6.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nMAPK6, also known as ERK3 or PRKM6, is classified as an atypical mitogen-activated protein kinase that forms a distinct subgroup together with ERK4 within the broader MAPK family (coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2). Unlike conventional MAPKs such as ERK1/2, which bear the characteristic Thr–X–Tyr dual phosphorylation motif, ERK3 contains a unique activation loop in which the canonical tyrosine is either absent or replaced by noncanonical residues such as glycine or glutamic acid, reflecting its divergent evolutionary origin (coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 2-4). Phylogenetic analyses reveal that the ERK3/ERK4 subfamily emerged through a gene duplication event that likely occurred in the chordate or early vertebrate lineage, resulting in conserved orthologs in species including human, mouse, rat, and zebrafish (huang2024reconstructingthedeep pages 16-18, turgeon2002theproteinkinase pages 6-7). Sequence comparisons indicate that ERK3 shares approximately 94% amino acid identity across species such as human, mouse, and rat, and its overall structure is related to the CMGC group of protein kinases, which includes cyclin-dependent kinases and glycogen synthase kinases (coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2, kultz1998phylogeneticandfunctional pages 1-2). In the kinome classification established in earlier landmark studies, MAPK6 has been assigned to the atypical MAPK subfamily distinct from the classical ERK1/2 cluster, with its evolutionary history tracking divergence from the ancestral ERK prior to the expansion of conventional MAPK signaling cascades (li2011evolutionaryhistoryof pages 4-5, pearson2001mitogenactivatedprotein(map) pages 5-6).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nMAPK6 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to hydroxyl groups on specific serine or threonine residues within protein substrates, thereby generating ADP and phosphorylated protein as products (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 25-26). The reaction follows a typical kinase reaction scheme: ATP + [protein substrate] → ADP + [protein substrate]-phosphate + H⁺, which is common among Ser/Thr kinases (turgeon2002theproteinkinase pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of MAPK6 is dependent on divalent cations such as Mg²⁺, which are required for optimal ATP binding and transfer of the phosphate group during the phosphorylation reaction (turgeon2002theproteinkinase pages 1-2, coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nMAPK6 exhibits substrate specificity characteristic of atypical MAPKs. It phosphorylates substrates including microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and MAPK-activated protein kinase 5 (MAPKAPK5) (coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2, cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 25-26). In its interaction with MAPKAPK5, MAPK6 is phosphorylated at a specific serine residue (Ser-189) within its activation loop, and following this event, MAPK6 in turn mediates further phosphorylation events that lead to the activation of MAPKAPK5 (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 25-26). Although a precise consensus substrate motif has not been definitively established for MAPK6, the observed phosphorylation events indicate a preference for serine residues within target proteins that subsequently regulate downstream signaling (coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 2-4).\n\n5. Structure  \nMAPK6 is a 721–amino acid protein with an approximate molecular mass of ~100 kDa, and its primary structure is composed of a central catalytic kinase domain flanked by regulatory regions (coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2). The central kinase domain displays the characteristic bilobal architecture observed in protein kinases, including the smaller N-terminal lobe primarily composed of β-sheets and a larger C-terminal lobe rich in α-helices (turgeon2002theproteinkinase pages 4-6). A unique feature of MAPK6 is its atypical activation loop, which diverges from the conventional Thr–X–Tyr motif found in other MAPKs and instead contains a single phosphoacceptor serine residue in an SEG motif (coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2, cultz1998phylogeneticandfunctional pages 13-14). In addition, MAPK6 possesses a long C-terminal extension that is absent in classical ERKs; this region includes unique sequences that may contribute to its regulatory interactions and stability (coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2, turgeon2002theproteinkinase pages 6-7). Structural modeling and sequence analysis suggest that the conserved kinase core enables MAPK6 to fold into a typical MAPK-like three-dimensional structure, while distinctive motifs, such as an SPR motif in subdomain VIII, serve to differentiate it functionally from conventional MAPKs (coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 2-4, pearson2001mitogenactivatedprotein(map) pages 5-6). Key catalytic features include the DFG motif at the beginning of the activation loop and the conserved lysine in the N-lobe that is essential for ATP binding; however, the atypical sequence variations in the activation loop underscore its unique regulatory properties (turgeon2002theproteinkinase pages 4-6).\n\n6. Regulation  \nMAPK6 regulation is distinct from that of conventional MAPKs in several respects. Rather than being phosphorylated via a canonical MAP kinase kinase (MAP2K) cascade, MAPK6 is regulated primarily through a series of phosphorylation events within its own structure and through interactions with downstream kinases such as MAPKAPK5 (coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 2-4, cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8). In the observed signaling complex, interaction with MAPKAPK5 promotes phosphorylation of MAPK6 at Ser-189 in the activation loop, and this modification is required for subsequent phosphorylation and activation of MAPKAPK5 (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 25-26). MAPK6 is also subject to autophosphorylation events, particularly within its extended C-terminal region, which may influence its catalytic activity and protein–protein interactions (coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2, hoeflich2006regulationoferk3mapk6 pages 1-2). Additional regulation occurs via mechanisms affecting protein stability, including ubiquitin-proteasome–mediated degradation, which modulates MAPK6 protein levels in a manner that is responsive to upstream signaling events such as those driven by oncogenic BRAF (hoeflich2006regulationoferk3mapk6 pages 1-2, ronkina2019germlinedeletion pages 4-6). These regulatory events are integral to controlling the subcellular localization and overall signaling output of MAPK6, and they distinguish its modulation from that of conventional MAPKs that rely on a three-tiered kinase cascade (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8).\n\n7. Function  \nMAPK6 functions as an atypical MAP kinase involved in numerous signaling pathways that regulate cellular processes. It phosphorylates microtubule-associated proteins such as MAP2 and also interacts with MAPK-activated protein kinase 5 (MAPKAPK5) to form a regulatory complex; within this complex, reciprocal phosphorylation events occur that collectively promote cell cycle entry (coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2, cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 25-26). Although the full spectrum of signaling outputs attributed to MAPK6 remains to be completely elucidated, its activity has been implicated in the modulation of processes such as cellular proliferation, differentiation, and cytoskeletal dynamics (coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 2-4, ronkina2019germlinedeletion pages 1-4). Expression studies and gene knockout experiments in vertebrate models indicate that MAPK6 plays roles in embryonic development and may impact cell cycle regulation, potentially promoting progression into the cell cycle through its phosphorylation of key substrates (coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2, ronkina2019germlinedeletion pages 20-23). The association of MAPK6 with MAPKAPK5 further supports its participation in a signaling axis that controls specific aspects of mitogenic signaling and may influence downstream transcriptional and cytoskeletal events critical for cellular morphogenesis (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 25-26, cultz1998phylogeneticandfunctional pages 5-9).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nAt present, there are no highly specific inhibitors reported that exclusively target MAPK6; therefore, pharmacological studies have primarily focused on the broader MAPK signaling network rather than on direct inhibition of this atypical MAPK (hoeflich2006regulationoferk3mapk6 pages 7-9, cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 8-9). Disease associations for MAPK6 include observations linking its activity to tumor suppression mechanisms as well as to oncogenic processes through modulation of cell proliferation and invasion, particularly in the context of melanoma driven by oncogenic BRAF signaling (hoeflich2006regulationoferk3mapk6 pages 1-2, ronkina2019germlinedeletion pages 20-23). Notable mutations in the MAPK6 gene are not well characterized in the current literature, and its precise role in human pathology remains under active investigation (coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2, ronkina2019germlinedeletion pages 4-6). Additional comments regarding MAPK6 emphasize its status as a conserved, vertebrate-specific kinase with distinctive regulatory and catalytic properties that set it apart from conventional MAPK family members, making it a subject of ongoing biochemical and cell biological research (coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 2-4, huang2024reconstructingthedeep pages 16-18).\n\n9.

The upstream activator of MAPK7 is the MAPK kinase MAP2K5. Upon activation, it translocates to the nucleus and phosphorylates various downstream targets including MEF2C. EGF activates MAPK7 through a Ras-independent and MAP2K5-dependent pathway. As part of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, acts as a negative regulator of apoptosis in cardiomyocytes via interaction with STUB1/CHIP and promotion of STUB1-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of ICER-type isoforms of CREM (By similarity). May have a role in muscle cell differentiation. May be important for endothelial function and maintenance of blood vessel integrity. MAP2K5 and MAPK7 interact specifically with one another and not with MEK1/ERK1 or MEK2/ERK2 pathways. Phosphorylates SGK1 at Ser-78 and this is required for growth factor-induced cell cycle progression.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nMitogen-activated protein kinase 7 (MAPK7), also known as ERK5, BMK1 or PRKM7, is a conventional member of the MAP kinase family that is clearly placed within the eukaryotic kinome. Orthologs of MAPK7 have been identified in a wide variety of species including mammals, birds, and lower vertebrates, consistent with its presence in the core signaling machinery that evolved early in eukaryotic history (nithianandarajahjones2012erk5structureregulation pages 1-3, nishimoto2006mapksignallingerk5 pages 1-2). Within the MAPK family, MAPK7 belongs to the TEY subfamily that also includes ERK1 and ERK2; however, its large molecular weight and extended C-terminal region distinguish it phylogenetically from its smaller paralogs. MAPK7 shares approximately 50–66% sequence identity in the kinase domain with ERK1/2 and is grouped with the classical MAPKs that have conserved activation loops and docking domains, suggesting an early gene duplication event that gave rise to distinct, non-redundant members within the family (nithianandarajahjones2012erk5structureregulation pages 1-3, nishimoto2006mapksignallingerk5 pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nMAPK7 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to specific serine and/or threonine residues on target protein substrates. The generalized chemical reaction can be written as:  \nATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺  \nThis phosphorylation reaction enables the post-translational modification of substrates and is a classical feature of serine/threonine kinases, including the conventional MAPK family (abe1999extracellularsignalregulatedkinase pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of MAPK7 is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ion cofactors, typically Mg²⁺, which are required to coordinate ATP binding and facilitate the phosphoryl transfer reaction (template model; coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nMAPK7 exhibits substrate specificity characteristic of the MAPK family, preferentially phosphorylating serine/threonine residues that are followed immediately by a proline residue. This proline-directed (S/T-P) consensus motif is recognized via a conserved P+1 pocket in the kinase catalytic cleft and is further fine-tuned through docking interactions mediated by complementary docking (D) motifs present on substrates such as transcription factors. For instance, MAPK7 targets the D-domain of MEF2 transcription factors, where mutations in key hydrophobic residues within the docking motif are known to diminish phosphorylation efficiency (barsytelovejoy2004erk5istargeted pages 5-6, orand2023revealingthemechanisma pages 56-59). In addition, MAPK7 phosphorylates SGK1 on Ser-78 in a manner that is essential for growth factor-induced cell cycle progression, suggesting that specific substrate recognition elements beyond the basic S/T-P motif contribute to its function (martin2016designandsynthesis pages 36-41).\n\n5. Structure  \nMAPK7 is an unusually large member of the MAPK family, consisting of 816 amino acids and displaying a modular architecture that underpins its dual kinase and transcriptional coactivator functions. The N-terminal region (approximately amino acids 1–406) harbors the well-conserved kinase domain; within this domain, key features include the activation loop containing the conserved Thr218-Glu220-Tyr220 (TEY) motif that undergoes dual phosphorylation for full catalytic activation, a common docking (CD) region (approximately amino acids 350–358) that facilitates the binding of substrate D-motifs, and a catalytic cleft that accommodates ATP in a Mg²⁺-dependent manner (lombardi2023optimizationofextracellular pages 19-23, nithianandarajahjones2012erk5structureregulation pages 1-3).  \nThe C-terminal region (approximately amino acids 407–816) is unique among MAPKs and contains multiple regulatory modules: a nuclear localization signal (NLS) located between amino acids 505–539, two proline-rich domains (PR1 spanning amino acids 434–465 and PR2 spanning amino acids 578–701), a MEF2-interacting region (approximately amino acids 440–501), and a transcriptional activation domain (approximately amino acids 664–789) that may undergo autophosphorylation. This extended C-terminal domain not only contributes to the protein’s subcellular localization but is also responsible for its non-catalytic functions such as direct gene transcription regulation (nithianandarajahjones2012erk5structureregulation pages 3-4, glatz2013structuralmechanismfor pages 9-11, lombardi2023optimizationofextracellular pages 19-23).  \nX-ray crystallographic studies of the kinase domain in complex with peptides derived from upstream activators such as MKK5 have revealed distinct surface features in the docking groove that underpin both substrate specificity and selective partner interactions; these include a flexible Q loop and a specificity loop that allow MAPK7 to distinguish its binding partners from those of canonical ERK1/2 (glatz2013structuralmechanismfor pages 8-9). Overall, the combination of a conserved catalytic core and a specialized regulatory tail accounts for the unique 3D structural and functional profile of MAPK7.\n\n6. Regulation  \nMAPK7 is activated by the MAPK kinase MAP2K5 (MEK5) which phosphorylates the TEY motif present in its activation loop – specifically phosphorylating Thr218 and Tyr220 – a modification that is essential for attaining full kinase activity. This dual phosphorylation induces a conformational change that disrupts an autoinhibitory interaction between the N- and C-terminal regions, thereby facilitating nuclear translocation (nithianandarajahjones2012erk5structureregulation pages 1-3, nishimoto2006mapksignallingerk5 pages 4-5).  \nIn addition to the upstream phosphorylation mediated by MEK5, MAPK7 can undergo autophosphorylation within its extended C-terminal tail; this event is linked to the modulation of its transcriptional activation function. Furthermore, MAPK7 serves as a negative regulator of apoptosis in cardiomyocytes through its interaction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase STUB1/CHIP. This interaction promotes STUB1-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of ICER-type isoforms of CREM, thereby contributing to cell survival signaling (information section, tubita2020beyondkinaseactivity pages 10-12).  \nMAPK7 regulation also involves specific docking interactions with upstream activators such as MEK5 and high affinity binding to substrates bearing specific D-motifs, ensuring that activation is contingent upon correct complex assembly within the MAPK/ERK signaling cascade (nithianandarajahjones2012erk5structureregulation pages 1-3, glatz2013structuralmechanismfor pages 7-8).\n\n7. Function  \nMAPK7 plays a multifaceted role in cellular signal transduction by integrating extracellular cues into intracellular responses. It is expressed ubiquitously, with particular functional significance in cells where proliferation, differentiation, and survival are critical. Upon activation by growth factors such as EGF – through a pathway that is Ras-independent yet MAP2K5-dependent – MAPK7 translocates to the nucleus where it phosphorylates a variety of substrates, including transcription factors such as MEF2C. This phosphorylation event is central to the regulation of genes involved in muscle cell differentiation and cardiomyocyte survival (information section, nishimoto2006mapksignallingerk5 pages 5-5).  \nIn addition to its role in transcriptional regulation, MAPK7 phosphorylates SGK1 at Ser-78, a modification that is required for growth factor-induced cell cycle progression. This indicates that MAPK7 functions at multiple nodes within the signal transduction network to support cell proliferation (information section, martin2016designandsynthesis pages 36-41).  \nMAPK7 also contributes to the maintenance of endothelial function and blood vessel integrity, with implications for vascular health. In cardiomyocytes, MAPK7 acts as a negative regulator of apoptosis by interfering with p53/TP53 regulation through disruption of the PML-MDM2 interaction, thus promoting cell survival (information section, lombardi2023optimizationofextracellular pages 19-23).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nPharmacological inhibition of MAPK7 has been explored as a potential strategy to modulate its diverse roles in proliferation, survival, and oncogenic signaling. Although specific inhibitors remain under active investigation, compounds that target the kinase domain or disrupt its regulatory interactions, such as those interfering with the MAP2K5–MAPK7 complex formation, have been reported in the literature (tubita2020beyondkinaseactivity pages 10-12).  \nMAPK7 has been linked to several disease states, notably in cardiovascular pathology, due to its role in cardiomyocyte survival and endothelial function. Furthermore, its involvement in the regulation of cell cycle progression and apoptosis suggests a relevance in tumorigenesis where aberrant MAPK7 activity could contribute to cancer development and progression (information section, yoshizumi2012theroleof pages 4-5, turjanski2007mapkinasesand pages 1-2).  \nIn addition, the specificity of MAPK7 for substrates such as MEF2 transcription factors distinguishes its signaling functions from those of other ERK family members, and alterations in this specificity, whether through mutations or misregulation of docking interactions, may have significant functional consequences. The development of databases and computational models to predict docking motifs in the human proteome is expected to further clarify MAPK7 substrate interactions (orand2023revealingthemechanisma pages 56-59).\n\n9.

Controls both, basal and starvation-induced autophagy throught its interaction with GABARAP, MAP1LC3B and GABARAPL1 leading to autophagosome formation, SQSTM1 degradation and reduced MAP1LC3B inhibitory phosphorylation (PubMed:22948227). Regulates primary cilium formation and the localization of ciliary proteins involved in cilium structure, transport, and signaling (PubMed:29021280). Prevents the relocation of the sugar-adding enzymes from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby restricting the production of sugar-coated proteins (PubMed:24618899). Upon amino-acid starvation, mediates transitional endoplasmic reticulum site disassembly and inhibition of secretion (PubMed:21847093). Binds to chromatin leading to MAPK15 activation and interaction with PCNA, that which protects genomic integrity by inhibiting MDM2-mediated degradation of PCNA (PubMed:20733054). Regulates DA transporter (DAT) activity and protein expression via activation of RhoA (PubMed:28842414). In response to H(2)O(2) treatment phosphorylates ELAVL1, thus preventing it from binding to the PDCD4 3'UTR and rendering the PDCD4 mRNA accessible to miR-21 and leading to its degradation and loss of protein expression (PubMed:26595526). Also functions in a kinase activity-independent manner as a negative regulator of growth (By similarity). Phosphorylates in vitro FOS and MBP (PubMed:11875070, PubMed:16484222, PubMed:19166846, PubMed:20638370). During oocyte maturation, plays a key role in the microtubule organization and meiotic cell cycle progression in oocytes, fertilized eggs, and early embryos (By similarity). Interacts with ESRRA promoting its re-localization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and then prevents its transcriptional activity (PubMed:21190936)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nMAPK15, also known as ERK7 or ERK8, is classified within the mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) family as an atypical MAPK that diverges from the canonical ERK1/2 and ERK5 subfamilies based on its unique evolutionary traits and regulatory mechanisms (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8). MAPK15 orthologs have been identified throughout evolution in diverse eukaryotic organisms including early‐branching unicellular eukaryotes, invertebrates such as Drosophila melanogaster, and across vertebrates, thereby supporting its conservation and placement among the MAPK complement present since before the last eukaryotic common ancestor (huang2024reconstructingthedeep pages 7-10, kalapos2019earlyevolutionof pages 3-5). The evolutionary analyses indicate that MAPK15 belongs to a basal lineage of MAP kinases that retained its ancestral TEY (Thr-Glu-Tyr) phosphorylation motif while other MAPK members, such as ERK3/4, underwent motif changes (li2011evolutionaryhistoryof pages 4-5). Furthermore, phylogenomic reconstructions have consistently placed MAPK15 in a distinct clade that separates it both structurally and functionally from conventional MAPKs, thus underscoring its atypical nature and unique regulation compared to other members of the MAPK family (o’shaughnessy2022notyourmother’s pages 2-5).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nMAPK15 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to a hydroxyl group on serine or threonine residues present in substrate proteins, thereby forming adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and a phosphorylated protein product along with the release of a proton (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of MAPK15 is dependent on divalent metal ions, with magnesium (Mg²⁺) serving as a critical cofactor that facilitates the binding and proper orientation of ATP in the kinase active site (coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 7-9).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nMAPK15 exhibits substrate specificity that is characteristic of serine/threonine kinases, and in vitro studies have demonstrated its ability to phosphorylate classical MAPK substrates such as myelin basic protein (MBP) and components like FOS, although a definitive consensus substrate motif for MAPK15 has not been firmly established (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8, li2011evolutionaryhistoryof pages 8-11). In addition, MAPK15 has been implicated in modulating substrates involved in autophagy and ciliary signaling pathways, as it interacts with autophagy regulators such as GABARAP, MAP1LC3B, and GABARAPL1 to facilitate autophagosome formation (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8). The substrate specificity appears to also encompass interaction with nuclear and cytoplasmic targets, including chromatin and proteins involved in the maintenance of genomic stability, although the precise phosphorylation motifs remain to be fully characterized (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 8-9, li2011evolutionaryhistoryof pages 12-13).\n\n5. Structure  \nMAPK15 has a kinase domain that is flanked by variable N- and C-terminal regions, with the catalytic core retaining the canonical MAPK fold composed of an N-terminal lobe featuring a predominantly β-sheet structure and a C-terminal lobe dominated by α-helices (coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 7-9). The activation loop in MAPK15 contains the conserved TEY motif, where phosphorylation occurs on the threonine and tyrosine residues, but uniquely for this atypical MAPK, this phosphorylation is predominantly constitutive and occurs via autophosphorylation rather than through upstream MAPK kinases (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8, dahm2025atypicalmapksin pages 7-8). A notable structural feature of MAPK15 is its extended C-terminal region, which is absent in conventional MAPKs; this C-terminal extension is implicated in directing subcellular localization and modulating autoactivation, and it may contain nuclear localization signals as well as domains involved in protein-protein interactions (dahm2025atypicalmapksin pages 7-8, huang2024reconstructingthedeep pages 16-18). In addition, the kinase domain exhibits a core architecture typical of the CMGC group of protein kinases, including a conserved lysine in the β3 strand for ATP binding, an invariant aspartate in the DFG motif crucial for coordinated magnesium ion binding, and a C-helix that participates in the regulation of catalytic activity through its interaction with the catalytic loop (lindin2014mitogenactivatedproteinkinaseactivated pages 16-22, coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2).\n\n6. Regulation  \nMAPK15 is regulated primarily through autophosphorylation of its activation loop, a process that leads to its constitutive basal phosphorylation state independent of classical upstream MAP2K activity (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8). In addition to autophosphorylation, the protein levels of MAPK15 are subject to regulation by the ubiquitin–proteasome system; the N-terminal region of the kinase has been implicated in proteasomal degradation, thereby controlling the overall protein turnover and steady-state levels within the cell (dahm2025atypicalmapksin pages 7-8). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation have been observed at the TEY motif (specifically Thr175 and Tyr177), and mutation of these residues results in the loss of kinase activity, reinforcing their importance for catalytic function (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8, coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 7-9). There is also evidence that MAPK15 may be regulated through its interactions with other proteins, such as chromatin components and regulatory factors like ESRRA, where binding can lead to subcellular relocalization and modulation of transcriptional activity (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 8-9, o’shaughnessy2022notyourmother’s pages 2-5).\n\n7. Function  \nMAPK15 plays multifunctional roles in regulating key cellular processes in a kinase activity–dependent manner. It is known to control both basal and starvation-induced autophagy through direct interactions with members of the ATG8 family (GABARAP, MAP1LC3B, and GABARAPL1) that lead to the formation of autophagosomes, the degradation of SQSTM1, and modulation of inhibitory phosphorylation on MAP1LC3B (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8). In addition, MAPK15 is involved in the regulation of primary cilium formation by orchestrating the localization of ciliary proteins that are critical for cilium structure, transport, and signaling, thereby playing a role in ciliogenesis (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8, huang2024reconstructingthedeep pages 14-16). MAPK15 also contributes to the regulation of protein trafficking and secretion; upon amino-acid starvation, it mediates transitional endoplasmic reticulum site disassembly and inhibits secretion by preventing the relocation of glycosylation enzymes from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8, huang2024reconstructingthedeep pages 16-18). The kinase further functions in the maintenance of genome integrity by binding to chromatin and interacting with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), thereby protecting PCNA from degradation mediated by MDM2 (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8). Moreover, MAPK15 regulates dopaminergic signaling by modulating dopamine transporter (DAT) activity and protein expression via activation of the small GTPase RhoA, and it is involved in post-stress responses by phosphorylating ELAVL1 in response to hydrogen peroxide treatment, which affects the stability of PDCD4 mRNA through microRNA-mediated regulation (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8, o’shaughnessy2022notyourmother’s pages 15-15). In addition to its kinase-dependent roles, MAPK15 has been reported to exert kinase activity–independent functions as a negative regulator of cellular growth (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nCurrently, there are no specific catalytic inhibitors available for MAPK15/ERK7/ERK8, which limits experimental investigation and therapeutic targeting of this atypical MAPK (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8, dahm2025atypicalmapksin pages 7-8). Disease associations for MAPK15 remain incomplete; while the kinase is implicated in processes related to autophagy, ciliogenesis, protein trafficking, and genome integrity, detailed in vivo substrate identification and precise links to specific pathological states, such as cancer or neurodegeneration, have not been fully established (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8, o’shaughnessy2022notyourmother’s pages 2-5). Furthermore, mutation data and structure–function relationships in the context of human diseases are still under investigation. In addition, despite its capacity to phosphorylate substrates like FOS and MBP in vitro, the substrate repertoire in vivo remains poorly characterized, and further research is required to elucidate its complete signaling network (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 8-9, li2011evolutionaryhistoryof pages 12-13).\n\n9.

Extracellular stimuli such as pro-inflammatory cytokines or physical stress stimulate the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAP/JNK) signaling pathway (PubMed:28943315). In this cascade, two dual specificity kinases MAP2K4/MKK4 and MAP2K7/MKK7 phosphorylate and activate MAPK8/JNK1. In turn, MAPK8/JNK1 phosphorylates a number of transcription factors, primarily components of AP-1 such as JUN, JDP2 and ATF2 and thus regulates AP-1 transcriptional activity (PubMed:18307971). Phosphorylates the replication licensing factor CDT1, inhibiting the interaction between CDT1 and the histone H4 acetylase HBO1 to replication origins (PubMed:21856198). Loss of this interaction abrogates the acetylation required for replication initiation (PubMed:21856198). Promotes stressed cell apoptosis by phosphorylating key regulatory factors including p53/TP53 and Yes-associates protein YAP1 (PubMed:21364637). In T-cells, MAPK8 and MAPK9 are required for polarized differentiation of T-helper cells into Th1 cells. Contributes to the survival of erythroid cells by phosphorylating the antagonist of cell death BAD upon EPO stimulation (PubMed:21095239). Mediates starvation-induced BCL2 phosphorylation, BCL2 dissociation from BECN1, and thus activation of autophagy (PubMed:18570871). Phosphorylates STMN2 and hence regulates microtubule dynamics, controlling neurite elongation in cortical neurons (By similarity). In the developing brain, through its cytoplasmic activity on STMN2, negatively regulates the rate of exit from multipolar stage and of radial migration from the ventricular zone (By similarity). Phosphorylates several other substrates including heat shock factor protein 4 (HSF4), the deacetylase SIRT1, ELK1, or the E3 ligase ITCH (PubMed:16581800, PubMed:17296730, PubMed:20027304). Phosphorylates the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer and plays a role in the regulation of the circadian clock (PubMed:22441692). Phosphorylates the heat shock transcription factor HSF1, suppressing HSF1-induced transcriptional activity (PubMed:10747973). Phosphorylates POU5F1, which results in the inhibition of POU5F1's transcriptional activity and enhances its proteasomal degradation (By similarity). Phosphorylates JUND and this phosphorylation is inhibited in the presence of MEN1 (PubMed:22327296). In neurons, phosphorylates SYT4 which captures neuronal dense core vesicles at synapses (By similarity). Phosphorylates EIF4ENIF1/4-ET in response to oxidative stress, promoting P-body assembly (PubMed:22966201). Phosphorylates SIRT6 in response to oxidative stress, stimulating its mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase activity (PubMed:27568560). Phosphorylates NLRP3, promoting assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome (PubMed:28943315). Phosphorylates ALKBH5 in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS), promoting ALKBH5 sumoylation and inactivation (PubMed:34048572)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nMitogen‐activated protein kinase 8 (MAPK8), also known as the c‐Jun N‐terminal kinase 1 (JNK1), belongs to the evolutionarily conserved mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) superfamily, which comprises a core set of kinases present from yeast through to humans. JNK1 is one of three JNK isoforms (JNK1/MAPK8, JNK2/MAPK9, and JNK3/MAPK10) that appear to have diverged through gene duplication events in early metazoans; in vertebrates, JNK1 and JNK2 are ubiquitously expressed, whereas JNK3 is largely confined to neuronal tissues, the heart, and testes (johnson2007thecjunkinasestressactivated pages 1-2). In the context of the human kinome, JNK1 is assigned to the stress‐activated protein kinases subgroup within the MAPK family, a group that is characterized by their regulation via dual‐phosphorylation within a Thr–Pro–Tyr (TPY) motif in the activation loop. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that MAPK8 is an ancient kinase that shares a high degree of structural and catalytic conservation with other MAPKs and is part of a highly intertwined signaling network that also includes upstream MAPK kinase kinases (MAP3Ks) and MAPK kinases (MAP2Ks) such as MKK4 and MKK7 (orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 25-29, johnson2007thecjunkinasestressactivated pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nMAPK8/JNK1 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on substrate proteins, thereby producing ADP and the phosphorylated protein along with the release of a proton. In biochemical terms, the reaction can be summarized as follows: ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (ansideri2018multiplestrategiestargeting pages 35-38).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of MAPK8/JNK1, like that of most kinases, is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ion cofactors, with Mg²⁺ being essential for the coordination of ATP within the kinase active site. This requirement ensures proper binding and orientation of ATP for efficient phosphoryl transfer to the substrate (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 5-6).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nMAPK8/JNK1 is a proline-directed serine/threonine kinase that exhibits substrate specificity largely determined by the amino acid context surrounding the phosphorylation site. JNK1 preferentially phosphorylates substrates on serine or threonine residues that are immediately followed by a proline residue (S/T-P motif), a feature that facilitates its targeting of transcription factors such as c-Jun, whose activity is enhanced upon phosphorylation at Ser63 and Ser73. In addition to c-Jun, MAPK8 phosphorylates a wide range of substrates including ATF2, p53, CDT1, and various regulatory proteins involved in apoptosis, microtubule dynamics, circadian rhythm regulation, and inflammatory signaling (johnson2007thecjunkinasestressactivated pages 1-2, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 2-3, cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 5-6). The consensus motif recognized by JNK1 reflects a requirement for a minimal serine/threonine-proline sequence, although additional docking interactions with substrate docking regions or motifs, such as those provided by JNK-interacting proteins (JIPs), further refine its substrate specificity (zeke2015systematicdiscoveryof pages 7-11).\n\n5. Structure  \nMAPK8/JNK1 is organized into a conserved kinase fold that is characteristic of serine/threonine kinases and displays a bilobal architecture. It contains a small N-terminal lobe predominantly composed of anti-parallel β-sheets that is responsible for ATP binding, and a larger C-terminal lobe enriched in α-helices that is critical for substrate recognition and proper alignment of catalytic residues (rehfeldt2020cjunnterminalkinase pages 11-13, orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 25-29). A key structural feature is the activation loop, which harbors a conserved Thr-Pro-Tyr (TPY) motif; dual phosphorylation at the threonine and tyrosine residues in this motif by the upstream kinases MKK4 and MKK7 is essential for JNK1 activation (ansideri2018multiplestrategiestargeting pages 38-42, barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 3-5). The structure also reveals a glycine-rich loop (G-loop) within the N-terminal domain that interacts with ATP, while the C-helix, often containing a critical lysine residue that forms a salt bridge with a glutamate residue, plays a role in stabilizing the active conformation of the enzyme (rehfeldt2020cjunnterminalkinase pages 11-13, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 4-6). Unique aspects of JNK1’s structure include well-characterized docking sites—such as the D-recruitment site (DRS)—which mediate interactions with substrates, scaffold proteins, and regulatory phosphatases, further modulating its activity and specificity (orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 33-38).\n\n6. Regulation  \nMAPK8/JNK1 is tightly regulated both by upstream kinases and by regulatory proteins that modulate its activity through post-translational modifications. Key to its activation is the dual phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine residues within the conserved TPY motif in the activation loop; this phosphorylation is carried out synergistically by the dual-specificity kinases MKK4 and MKK7 (ansideri2018multiplestrategiestargeting pages 38-42, park2019mkk7theessential pages 1-2). Scaffold proteins such as JNK-interacting protein 1 (JIP1) further organize the components of the kinase cascade, ensuring efficient signal transduction and substrate specificity (orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 175-178, rehfeldt2020cjunnterminalkinase pages 5-7). Additionally, MAPK8/JNK1 is subject to regulation by dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs/MKPs), including MKP-1, MKP-7, and others, which dephosphorylate the activation loop and attenuate kinase signaling. Other post-translational modifications, for example, phosphorylation events beyond the activation loop on interacting proteins, also contribute to the fine-tuning of JNK1 activity; these modifications can influence the kinase’s interaction with substrate docking motifs and modify its subcellular localization (johnson2007thecjunkinasestressactivated pages 2-4, ha2019phosphorylationdynamicsof pages 15-16). The net result of these regulatory inputs is a tightly controlled signaling pathway that enables context-dependent activation of JNK1 in response to various extracellular stimuli such as pro-inflammatory cytokines, UV irradiation, reactive oxygen species, and other stress signals (ansideri2018multiplestrategiestargeting pages 38-42, johnson2007thecjunkinasestressactivated pages 4-5).\n\n7. Function  \nMAPK8/JNK1 plays multifaceted roles in cellular biology by mediating the phosphorylation of a diverse array of substrates involved in transcriptional regulation, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, migration, apoptosis, and stress responses. One of its primary functions in the nucleus is to phosphorylate components of the activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor complex, principally c-Jun, thereby modulating the expression of genes that govern cell survival, stress responses, and programmed cell death (ansideri2018multiplestrategiestargeting pages 38-42, barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 8-9). In addition, MAPK8 phosphorylates several other regulatory proteins such as ATF2, p53, and Yes-associated protein YAP1, contributing to the induction of apoptosis under conditions of cellular stress or DNA damage (johnson2007thecjunkinasestressactivated pages 4-5, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 18-19). In the context of cell cycle regulation, JNK1 phosphorylates the replication licensing factor CDT1, thereby inhibiting its interaction with the histone acetylase HBO1 and preventing the acetylation events required for replication initiation (ansideri2018multiplestrategiestargeting pages 38-42). Furthermore, JNK1 contributes to the regulation of autophagy by phosphorylating BCL2, leading to its dissociation from BECN1 and subsequent activation of the autophagic process (ansideri2018multiplestrategiestargeting pages 38-42). In immune cells, specifically T-cells, MAPK8 along with its close homolog MAPK9 is implicated in the differentiation of T-helper cells into the Th1 subtype, while in erythroid cells, JNK1-mediated phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAD promotes cell survival following erythropoietin stimulation (johnson2007thecjunkinasestressactivated pages 5-6). Neuronal functions of JNK1 include the regulation of microtubule dynamics through phosphorylation of stathmin-like proteins such as STMN2, thereby controlling neurite elongation and neuronal migration, processes that are essential for proper brain development (ansideri2018multiplestrategiestargeting pages 38-42, orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 41-45). Moreover, JNK1 plays a role in circadian rhythm regulation through phosphorylation of the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer, and it modulates stress responses by phosphorylating heat shock transcription factors such as HSF1 and HSF4 (ansideri2018multiplestrategiestargeting pages 35-38, rehfeldt2020cjunnterminalkinase pages 9-11). Collectively, these functions underscore the central role of MAPK8/JNK1 in integrating extracellular stress signals into appropriate cellular responses that impact gene expression, cell fate decisions, and homeostasis (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8, johnson2007thecjunkinasestressactivated pages 5-6).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nNumerous small-molecule inhibitors of MAPK8/JNK1 have been developed for experimental and therapeutic purposes, reflecting its involvement in diseases such as cancer, neurodegeneration, metabolic disorders, and inflammation. Inhibitors such as SP600125 and CEP-1347 have been shown to block JNK activity in various preclinical studies, reducing apoptosis and tissue damage in models of ischemia/reperfusion injury and neurodegeneration (johnson2007thecjunkinasestressactivated pages 4-5, rehfeldt2020cjunnterminalkinase pages 9-11). Moreover, the ubiquitous involvement of MAPK8/JNK1 in stress and inflammatory signaling pathways has provided the rationale for targeting this kinase in conditions like Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and chronic inflammatory disorders (rehfeldt2020cjunnterminalkinase pages 5-7, orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 77-81). Disease-associated genetic variants and aberrant activation of MAPK8 have been implicated in altered cellular responses, including defective apoptotic signaling and impaired cell cycle regulation, highlighting its relevance as a therapeutic target. Lastly, detailed computational studies have facilitated the design of non-ATP competitive inhibitors that exploit alternative binding modes in regions such as substrate docking sites, aiming to enhance the specificity of inhibition given the highly conserved nature of the ATP-binding pocket across the MAPK family (schnieders2012computationalinsightsfor pages 1-2). These aspects emphasize the dual promise of targeting JNK1 both for dissecting basic biological processes and for developing potential drug candidates (johnson2007thecjunkinasestressactivated pages 4-5).\n\n9.

Extracellular stimuli such as pro-inflammatory cytokines or physical stress stimulate the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAP/JNK) signaling pathway. In this cascade, two dual specificity kinases MAP2K4/MKK4 and MAP2K7/MKK7 phosphorylate and activate MAPK9/JNK2 (PubMed:10376527, PubMed:15805466, PubMed:17525747, PubMed:19675674, PubMed:20595622, PubMed:21364637, PubMed:22441692, PubMed:34048572). In turn, MAPK9/JNK2 phosphorylates a number of transcription factors, primarily components of AP-1 such as JUN and ATF2 and thus regulates AP-1 transcriptional activity (PubMed:10376527). In response to oxidative or ribotoxic stresses, inhibits rRNA synthesis by phosphorylating and inactivating the RNA polymerase 1-specific transcription initiation factor RRN3 (PubMed:15805466). Promotes stressed cell apoptosis by phosphorylating key regulatory factors including TP53 and YAP1 (PubMed:17525747, PubMed:21364637). In T-cells, MAPK8 and MAPK9 are required for polarized differentiation of T-helper cells into Th1 cells (PubMed:19290929). Upon T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, is activated by CARMA1, BCL10, MAP2K7 and MAP3K7/TAK1 to regulate JUN protein levels (PubMed:19290929). Plays an important role in the osmotic stress-induced epithelial tight-junctions disruption (PubMed:20595622). When activated, promotes beta-catenin/CTNNB1 degradation and inhibits the canonical Wnt signaling pathway (PubMed:19675674). Also participates in neurite growth in spiral ganglion neurons (By similarity). Phosphorylates the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer and plays a role in the regulation of the circadian clock (PubMed:22441692). Phosphorylates POU5F1, which results in the inhibition of POU5F1's transcriptional activity and enhances its proteasomal degradation (By similarity). Phosphorylates ALKBH5 in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS), promoting ALKBH5 sumoylation and inactivation (PubMed:34048572)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nMAPK9, also known as JNK2, is a member of the c‐Jun N‐terminal kinase (JNK) subgroup within the mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) superfamily. JNK2 is evolutionarily conserved across vertebrates and is one of three JNK isoforms (JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3); with JNK1 and JNK2 being ubiquitously expressed and JNK3 largely restricted to the brain, heart, and testis. Phylogenetic studies indicate that the JNK family belongs to a group of stress‐activated protein kinases that evolved by gene duplication events in the common ancestral eukaryote, and additional duplications in early vertebrate evolution led to the present diversity among isoforms. JNK2, in particular, is classified within the JNK branch alongside its paralogs and shares high sequence identity with other JNKs; however, subtle differences in regulatory and docking domains contribute to its functional differentiation within the kinome (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 6-7, krens1887molecularcellbiolog(ibl) pages 17-18, kyriakis2012mammalianmapksignal pages 2-3).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nMAPK9 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to specific serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins, generating adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and a phosphorylated protein. In chemical terms, the reaction can be represented as:  \n  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺  \nThis phosphorylation reaction is central to modulating the function of target proteins involved in signaling cascades (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 4-6).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nLike other protein kinases, MAPK9 requires divalent metal ions as cofactors to facilitate the catalytic transfer of a phosphate group from ATP. The activity of JNK2 is most commonly dependent on Mg²⁺, which binds to ATP, thereby correctly positioning the phosphate groups for the phosphoryl transfer reaction (humanUnknownyeardatasheet(cat. pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nMAPK9 exhibits substrate specificity that is dictated by both the local phosphorylation motif and distal docking interactions. JNK2 phosphorylates substrates chiefly at serine or threonine residues that are immediately followed by a proline residue; thus, the minimal consensus phosphorylation motif is generally represented as S/T-P. Detailed analyses of substrate peptides derived from transcription factors such as c-Jun, ATF2, and other AP-1 components consistently show that the phosphorylatable residue is embedded within a proline-directed sequence (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 9-10, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 4-6). Moreover, substrate recognition by JNK2 is enhanced by the presence of docking motifs (also referred to as D-sites or JNK-binding domains [JBDs]) found on target proteins. These docking domains typically consist of basic regions followed by hydrophobic residues (often conforming to patterns such as L-X-L or LXLXL), which engage complementary, negatively charged surfaces on the kinase. The functional consequence of this dual mode of recognition – the inherent S/T-P phosphorylation motif along with the auxiliary D-site interaction – is a heightened specificity for substrates such as members of the Jun family, ATF family transcription factors, and other regulatory proteins involved in stress response pathways (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 16-18, bardwell2015twohydrophobicresidues pages 10-11, whisenant2010computationalpredictionand pages 14-14).\n\n5. Structure  \nMAPK9 is composed of a central kinase domain that conforms to the canonical bilobal structure characteristic of the MAPK family. The N-terminal lobe consists predominantly of β-sheets and the C-terminal lobe is mainly α-helical; the ATP binding site is located in the cleft between these lobes. Critical structural features include an activation loop containing the TxY motif (typically encompassing residues 183–185 in JNK2) that must undergo dual phosphorylation for full catalytic activity. The kinase domain harbors conserved elements such as the glycine-rich loop involved in ATP binding, a catalytic loop—including the HRDLKxxN motif—and a regulatory C-helix that participates in the proper alignment of catalytic residues (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 3-4, wu2018structuralbasisfor pages 1-2). In addition, MAPK9 possesses substrate-docking grooves that interact with D-sites on target proteins. These grooves are formed by a combination of hydrophobic patches and negatively charged residues, which together facilitate binding of positively charged and hydrophobic residues in the substrate’s docking region. High-resolution X-ray crystallographic studies of related JNK isoforms have highlighted the structural basis of these interactions and the subtle differences that modulate isoform-specific substrate affinity (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 6-7, bardwell2015twohydrophobicresidues pages 7-9).\n\n6. Regulation  \nMAPK9 activity is regulated by a series of well-orchestrated phosphorylation events and protein-protein interactions. Activation of JNK2 occurs via dual phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine residues within the TxY activation loop by upstream dual specificity kinases, primarily MAP2K4 (MKK4) and MAP2K7 (MKK7). These phosphorylation events induce a conformational change that realigns key catalytic residues within the kinase domain, transitioning MAPK9 from an inactive to an active state (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 2-3, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 26-27).  \nBeyond activation loop phosphorylation, MAPK9 is subject to additional layers of regulation via docking interactions. Substrates and regulatory scaffold proteins – such as JNK-interacting protein 1 (JIP1) – possess specialized docking motifs that mediate binding to distinct surfaces on the kinase, thereby influencing both substrate recruitment and specificity (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 7-9, whisenant2010computationalpredictionand pages 5-7).  \nPost-translational modifications beyond phosphorylation have been identified as modulators of JNK2 function. For instance, ubiquitylation and acetylation have been reported and are thought to impact the stability, localization, and overall signaling output of MAPK9, although precise sites and enzyme effectors are less comprehensively defined in the current context (gehi2022intrinsicdisorderin pages 18-20).\n\n7. Function  \nMAPK9 plays pivotal roles in mediating cellular responses to a variety of extracellular stress signals, including pro-inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, and ribotoxic insults. Upon activation by MKK4/MKK7, JNK2 phosphorylates numerous transcription factors, most notably c-Jun and ATF2, which are components of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) complex. This phosphorylation modulates gene expression to coordinate responses such as apoptosis, cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 2-3, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 7-9).  \nIn addition to its role in regulating AP-1 activity, MAPK9 has been implicated in several other cellular processes. For example, under oxidative or ribotoxic stress, JNK2 phosphorylates the RNA polymerase I-specific transcription initiation factor RRN3, leading to inhibition of ribosomal RNA synthesis. It also contributes to the promotion of apoptosis by phosphorylating key regulators such as TP53 and YAP1. In T-cells, both JNK1 and JNK2 are necessary for the polarized differentiation of T-helper cells into the Th1 subset following T-cell receptor stimulation, a process mediated in part by the upstream activation cascade that includes CARMA1, BCL10, and TAK1 (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 25-26, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 7-9).  \nMAPK9 further influences epithelial integrity, as its activation under osmotic stress conditions contributes to the disruption of epithelial tight junctions. Moreover, once activated, JNK2 can promote the degradation of beta-catenin (CTNNB1), thereby inhibiting the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Other cellular functions attributed to MAPK9 include participation in neurite outgrowth in neuronal cells and the regulation of circadian rhythms through phosphorylation of the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer. Additionally, phosphorylation of POU5F1 and ALKBH5 by JNK2 leads to alterations in the transcriptional activity and stability of these proteins, respectively, thereby modulating cellular processes in a context-dependent manner (Information section, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 2-3, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 18-19, kyriakis2012mammalianmapksignal pages 9-10, gehi2022intrinsicdisorderin pages 28-29).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral experimental inhibitors targeting MAPK9 have been investigated given its critical roles in stress signaling and disease processes such as cancer, diabetes, and neurodegeneration. Although specific compounds are not enumerated in the context provided, MAPK9 remains an attractive target for pharmacological intervention with the potential to modulate its activity in processes such as T-cell differentiation, apoptosis, and metabolic regulation. Disease associations linked to MAPK9 include defects in immune responses, aberrations in apoptotic signaling leading to cancer cell survival, and dysregulated circadian rhythms. The diverse roles of MAPK9 in these processes underscore its importance as a signaling node whose dysregulation may contribute to multiple pathologies (Information section, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 26-27, kyriakis2012mammalianmapksignal pages 9-10, gehi2022intrinsicdisorderin pages 28-29).\n\n9.

In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nMitogen‐activated protein kinase 10 (MAPK10), also known as JNK3, belongs to the c‐Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) subfamily within the larger group of mitogen‐activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which in turn are part of the CMGC group of serine/threonine kinases. Among the three JNK isoforms (JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3), MAPK10/JNK3 is distinguished by its preferential expression in neuronal tissues, as well as in heart and testes, in contrast to the ubiquitous expression of JNK1 and JNK2 (ansideri2018multiplestrategiestargeting pages 38-42, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 2-3). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that JNK family members emerged early in eukaryotic evolution – as evidenced by their conservation from yeast to mammals – and that gene duplication events have given rise to the distinct isoforms. In particular, studies tracking the evolutionary history of the JNK transcripts have shown that the gene family is highly conserved and that alternative splicing events have resulted in both shared and isoform-specific roles (aithamlat2020transcripts’evolutionaryhistory pages 2-4). The kinase is therefore embedded in an ancient signaling network central to stress responses, and its sequence conservation underscores its importance in neuronal and stress‐activated signaling pathways.\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nMAPK10/JNK3 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphoryl group from ATP to specific serine and threonine residues on target proteins. The reaction can be defined as follows:  \nATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (ansideri2018multiplestrategiestargeting pages 23-28, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 7-9).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of MAPK10/JNK3 depends on the presence of divalent metal ion cofactors, with Mg²⁺ being required for efficient ATP binding and phosphoryl transfer. This cofactor requirement is typical for serine/threonine kinases within the CMGC group (ansideri2018multiplestrategiestargeting pages 23-28).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nMAPK10/JNK3 exhibits substrate specificity characteristic of proline-directed serine/threonine kinases. It preferentially phosphorylates substrates at serine or threonine residues that are immediately followed by a proline, forming S/T-P motifs. For instance, JNK3 phosphorylates transcription factors such as c-Jun on Ser63/73 and ATF2, thereby modulating the AP-1 transcription complex activity (ansideri2018multiplestrategiestargeting pages 42-45, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 3-4). In addition, JNK3 targets proteins involved in neuronal functions such as the microtubule regulator STMN2 and the amyloid precursor protein (APP), where phosphorylation plays a role in neuronal differentiation and APP processing (ansideri2018multiplestrategiestargeting pages 42-45). The consensus substrate recognition is determined by local sequence context and docking motifs, which facilitate binding through interactions with specific docking grooves on JNK3’s surface (orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 296-298).\n\n5. Structure  \nMAPK10/JNK3 is organized around a central kinase domain, which is characteristic of the MAPK family and consists of a conserved N-terminal lobe, predominantly composed of beta-sheets, and a larger C-terminal lobe enriched in alpha-helices. The ATP binding cleft is located at the interface of these two lobes. Key catalytic features include the activation loop containing a conserved Thr-Xxx-Tyr (TXY) motif that requires dual phosphorylation for full activation by upstream kinases MKK4 and MKK7 (ansideri2018multiplestrategiestargeting pages 38-42, cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 1-1).  \nUnique structural characteristics of JNK3 include extended regions outside the canonical kinase domain that contribute to its tissue-specific functions; for example, these regions are thought to mediate interactions with scaffold proteins such as members of the JNK-interacting protein (JIP) family. Structural studies, including crystallographic data on inactive, non-phosphorylated forms of JNK isoforms and peptide complexes derived from JIP proteins, reveal a typical kinase fold coupled with distinct features in the docking (CD) domain that facilitate substrate and regulator binding (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 4-6, orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 33-38). Moreover, the hydrophobic spine and the C-helix play critical roles in the alignment of catalytic residues and in mediating conformational transitions between active and inactive states.\n\n6. Regulation  \nMAPK10/JNK3 is regulated primarily through phosphorylation by upstream dual-specificity kinases MAP2K4/MKK4 and MAP2K7/MKK7, which act on the Thr and Tyr residues within its activation loop. This dual phosphorylation is essential for inducing structural rearrangements that align the catalytic machinery for efficient phosphoryl transfer (ansideri2018multiplestrategiestargeting pages 35-38, cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 4-5). In addition to upstream kinase activity, JNK3 regulation is further modulated by scaffold proteins, notably the members of the JNK-interacting protein family, which assemble MAPK cascade components to ensure specificity and efficiency of signal transduction (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 16-18, orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 211-213). Post-translational modifications within JNK3 and its interacting partners (such as phosphorylation of scaffold proteins like JIP1 and 14-3-3 proteins) contribute to feedback loops that either sustain or attenuate kinase signaling, influencing factors such as nuclear translocation and binding affinity for substrates (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 26-27, orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 81-84).\n\n7. Function  \nMAPK10/JNK3 plays crucial roles in neuronal biology and stress signaling. It is principally involved in mediating responses to extracellular stress stimuli such as pro-inflammatory cytokines, physical stress, and oxidative insults. In neurons, JNK3 regulates processes such as cellular proliferation, differentiation, migration, and programmed cell death. Activation of the SAPK/JNK pathway by upstream kinases leads to phosphorylation of transcription factors—including c-Jun, ATF2, and JUND—which ultimately modulate gene expression programs that control apoptosis and other stress responses (ansideri2018multiplestrategiestargeting pages 42-45, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 7-9). Beyond transcriptional regulation, JNK3 phosphorylates neuronal proteins such as the microtubule regulator STMN2, influencing neurite outgrowth and cytoskeletal dynamics, and modulates the amyloid precursor protein (APP) signaling pathway during neuronal differentiation (ansideri2018multiplestrategiestargeting pages 42-45). In addition, JNK3 phosphorylates components involved in circadian regulation such as the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer, thereby playing a role in the photic entrainment of the circadian clock (ansideri2018multiplestrategiestargeting pages 42-45). The kinase also participates in the regulation of neuronal apoptosis, which is implicated in neurodegenerative conditions, as well as in the modulation of stress responses that underlie developmental and pathological processes in the nervous system (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 27-28, orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 296-298).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral inhibitors targeting JNK family kinases have been developed, with some experimental compounds showing a degree of selectivity towards the JNK isoforms. For instance, SP600125 is an ATP-competitive inhibitor known to inhibit JNK activity, although its selectivity is not ideal and it affects multiple JNK isoforms (ansideri2018multiplestrategiestargeting pages 35-38). The involvement of JNK3 in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, as well as in neuronal apoptosis, has spurred interest in developing more selective JNK3 inhibitors. In addition, phosphorylation events mediated by JNK3 have been linked to the regulation of amyloid-beta production via phosphorylation of APP and to the modulation of circadian regulators via phosphorylation of CLOCK-BMAL1, which highlights the kinase’s multifaceted roles in neuronal signaling and potential pathological conditions (ansideri2018multiplestrategiestargeting pages 42-45, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 29-30). Further research is expected to refine our understanding of isoform-specific inhibition, which may have therapeutic implications, particularly for neurodegenerative disorders (orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 41-45).\n\n9.

Regulates protein synthesis through phosphorylation of EIF4B, RPS6 and EEF2K, and contributes to cell survival by repressing the pro-apoptotic function of BAD (PubMed:11500364, PubMed:12801526, PubMed:14673156, PubMed:15071500, PubMed:15341740, PubMed:16286006, PubMed:17052453, PubMed:17053147, PubMed:17936702, PubMed:18952604, PubMed:19085255, PubMed:19720745, PubMed:19935711, PubMed:19995915, PubMed:22017876, PubMed:23429703, PubMed:28178239). Under conditions of nutrient depletion, the inactive form associates with the EIF3 translation initiation complex (PubMed:16286006). Upon mitogenic stimulation, phosphorylation by the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) leads to dissociation from the EIF3 complex and activation (PubMed:16286006). The active form then phosphorylates and activates several substrates in the pre-initiation complex, including the EIF2B complex and the cap-binding complex component EIF4B (PubMed:16286006). Also controls translation initiation by phosphorylating a negative regulator of EIF4A, PDCD4, targeting it for ubiquitination and subsequent proteolysis (PubMed:17053147). Promotes initiation of the pioneer round of protein synthesis by phosphorylating POLDIP3/SKAR (PubMed:15341740). In response to IGF1, activates translation elongation by phosphorylating EEF2 kinase (EEF2K), which leads to its inhibition and thus activation of EEF2 (PubMed:11500364). Also plays a role in feedback regulation of mTORC2 by mTORC1 by phosphorylating MAPKAP1/SIN1, MTOR and RICTOR, resulting in the inhibition of mTORC2 and AKT1 signaling (PubMed:15899889, PubMed:19720745, PubMed:19935711, PubMed:19995915). Also involved in feedback regulation of mTORC1 and mTORC2 by phosphorylating DEPTOR (PubMed:22017876). Mediates cell survival by phosphorylating the pro-apoptotic protein BAD and suppressing its pro-apoptotic function (By similarity). Phosphorylates mitochondrial URI1 leading to dissociation of a URI1-PPP1CC complex (PubMed:17936702). The free mitochondrial PPP1CC can then dephosphorylate RPS6KB1 at Thr-412, which is proposed to be a negative feedback mechanism for the RPS6KB1 anti-apoptotic function (PubMed:17936702). Mediates TNF-alpha-induced insulin resistance by phosphorylating IRS1 at multiple serine residues, resulting in accelerated degradation of IRS1 (PubMed:18952604). In cells lacking functional TSC1-2 complex, constitutively phosphorylates and inhibits GSK3B (PubMed:17052453). May be involved in cytoskeletal rearrangement through binding to neurabin (By similarity). Phosphorylates and activates the pyrimidine biosynthesis enzyme CAD, downstream of MTOR (PubMed:23429703). Following activation by mTORC1, phosphorylates EPRS and thereby plays a key role in fatty acid uptake by adipocytes and also most probably in interferon-gamma-induced translation inhibition (PubMed:28178239)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nRibosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1), commonly designated as S6K1, is a member of the AGC kinase family, a group that includes protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase G (PKG), and protein kinase C (PKC). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that S6K1 is conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution and is present in all mammalian species, as part of an evolutionarily ancient core of TOR pathway genes that date back to the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA). Moreover, S6K1 shares evolutionary relationships with related kinases such as p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK), with evidence indicating that both S6K and RSK originated from a gene duplication event in the common ancestor of animals and fungi (magnuson2012regulationandfunction pages 2-3, sridharan2020distinctrolesof pages 1-3). Comparative analyses demonstrate that orthologs of S6K1 exist across diverse species including humans, mice, Xenopus, and yeast, underscoring its essential and conserved role in coupling nutrient and growth factor signals to cell proliferation and metabolism (pende2014ribosomalproteins6 pages 1-3).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nRPS6KB1 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to protein substrates containing serine or threonine residues. The reaction can be summarized as: ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (template). This phosphorylation reaction is vital for initiating a cascade of events that regulate protein synthesis and cell proliferation (magnuson2012regulationandfunction pages 6-7).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of S6K1 is dependent on divalent metal ions. In particular, Mg²⁺ is required as a cofactor to facilitate ATP binding and proper orientation of the phosphate groups for transfer to the substrate (template, fumagalli2022s6kinase1 pages 3-4).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nS6K1 exhibits a substrate specificity that is defined by a consensus sequence motif. The typical motif recognized by S6K1 is RxRxxp[ST], where “p[ST]” represents the phosphorylated serine or threonine residue. This motif guides S6K1 to phosphorylate various key substrates involved in translation and signal transduction, such as the ribosomal protein S6, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B), and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K) (template, roux2018signalingpathwaysinvolved pages 11-13).\n\n5. Structure  \nS6K1 contains a central catalytic kinase domain that is flanked by regulatory regions which are largely intrinsically disordered. One key structural feature is the conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif located near the N-terminus; this motif, typically an FDIDL sequence in human S6K1, is crucial for binding to the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1, thereby facilitating its activation by mTORC1 (magnuson2012regulationandfunction pages 3-4, sunami2010structuralbasisof pages 1-2). The kinase domain itself is organized in a bilobal fold with an N-terminal lobe that predominantly binds ATP and a C-terminal lobe that coordinates substrate binding; within this enzyme, the activation loop requires phosphorylation for full activation. Crystal structural data reveal that phosphorylation of residues in the activation loop, such as Thr252 (in the case of human p70S6K1), drives conformational changes that allow proper substrate access, while the hydrophobic motif is phosphorylated at residues such as Thr389, stabilizing the active conformation (sunami2010structuralbasisof pages 7-8, magnuson2012regulationandfunction pages 10-11). In addition, S6K1 features a C-terminal region which, in some isoforms, contains a PDZ-binding domain, and in the longer p85 isoform, a nuclear localization signal (NLS) is present; these structural variations contribute to the differential subcellular localization of its isoforms (malanchuk2024investigatingtheregulation pages 1-2, pende2014ribosomalproteins6 pages 7-10). Residues involved in coordinating ATP and substrate contacts are highly conserved, and the active site displays a DFG-in conformation typical of serine/threonine kinases, which is imperative for catalytic activity (sunami2010structuralbasisof pages 8-9).\n\n6. Regulation  \nS6K1 activation is regulated by a multi-step hierarchical phosphorylation mechanism. Under conditions of growth factor stimulation and nutrient abundance, mTORC1 phosphorylates S6K1 at a critical hydrophobic motif residue—Thr389 in S6K1—which acts as a priming event that creates a docking site for phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1). Subsequent phosphorylation of the activation loop residue Thr229 by PDK1 completes the activation process (magnuson2012regulationandfunction pages 3-4, sridharan2020distinctrolesof pages 3-5). Additional phosphorylation events occur at sites within the C-terminal autoinhibitory region, including modifications by proline-directed kinases such as cyclin-dependent kinases and MAPK, which relieve autoinhibition and can modulate substrate specificity (fumagalli2022s6kinase1 pages 3-4, sridhar2022targetingrps6k1for pages 1-4). S6K1 is also subject to negative regulation by phosphatases such as PP2A, which dephosphorylate key activating residues, and by ubiquitination events that target S6K1 for proteasomal degradation; acetylation has also been reported to affect its protein stability (magnuson2012regulationandfunction pages 15-16, thiriet2013cytoplasmicproteinserinethreonine pages 63-66). The specificity of mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation is mediated by the TOS motif interaction with RAPTOR, ensuring that S6K1 activation is tightly coupled to upstream signals such as the availability of amino acids and energy status (pende2014ribosomalproteins6 pages 3-5, kim2009regulationandlocalization pages 10-11). Furthermore, differential phosphorylation and subcellular shuttling of distinct isoforms (p70 versus p85) modulate the precise outcomes of S6K1 signaling in different cellular contexts (sridhar2022targetingrps6k1for pages 7-11, malanchuk2024investigatingtheregulation pages 1-2).\n\n7. Function  \nS6K1 plays a central role in mediating translational control, cell growth, and cell cycle progression through its action downstream of the mTORC1 pathway. By phosphorylating substrates such as ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6), eIF4B, and eEF2K, S6K1 promotes mRNA translation, thereby enhancing protein synthesis and cell growth (fumagalli2022s6kinase1 pages 3-4, pende2014ribosomalproteins6 pages 5-7). In addition to ribosome biogenesis, S6K1 phosphorylates the translational repressor PDCD4, leading to its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation, which facilitates cap-dependent translation initiation. The kinase further phosphorylates components involved in the pioneer round of translation, such as POLDIP3/SKAR, thereby ensuring efficient mRNA processing and translation of newly spliced transcripts (sridhar2022targetingrps6k1for pages 7-11). Beyond its canonical role in protein synthesis, S6K1 contributes to cell survival through its phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAD, thereby impairing its ability to induce apoptosis (fumagalli2022s6kinase1 pages 3-4). Furthermore, S6K1 is implicated in metabolic regulation, for example by phosphorylating IRS1 on multiple serine residues and promoting its degradation—this regulation is associated with the development of insulin resistance (fumagalli2022s6kinase1 pages 10-10, sridhar2022targetingrps6k1for pages 4-7). S6K1 also plays a part in feedback inhibition of mTOR signaling; it phosphorylates components such as mTOR, RICTOR, and SIN1, thereby modulating the activity of mTORC2 and downstream AKT signaling (magnuson2012regulationandfunction pages 17-17, sridhar2022targetingrps6k1for pages 11-13). Additionally, S6K1 phosphorylates the pyrimidine biosynthesis enzyme CAD to regulate de novo nucleotide synthesis, underscoring its role in metabolic reprogramming (fumagalli2022s6kinase1 pages 10-10). In various cell types, the distinct isoforms of S6K1 (p70 and p85) exhibit differential subcellular localizations that allow S6K1 to integrate signals emanating from both cytosolic and nuclear compartments, thereby affecting processes such as cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation (malanchuk2024investigatingtheregulation pages 1-2, sridhar2022targetingrps6k1for pages 7-11).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nMultiple inhibitors targeting the S6K1 signaling axis have been developed; among the most characterized is the ATP-competitive inhibitor PF-4708671, which has been shown to selectively inhibit S6K1 activity with approximately 20-fold greater potency relative to closely related kinases such as RSK1 and MSK1 (sridhar2022targetingrps6k1for pages 1-4). Other investigational compounds, including LY2584702 and TAS0612, exhibit the capacity to inhibit S6K1 and have entered clinical trials for cancer therapy, particularly in settings of aberrant mTOR pathway activation and PTEN loss (sridhar2022targetingrps6k1for pages 11-13). S6K1 dysregulation has been associated with oncogenesis, metabolic disorders, and insulin resistance as a consequence of its role in phosphorylating IRS1, BAD, and other regulators of cell survival and metabolic homeostasis (fumagalli2022s6kinase1 pages 10-10, yi2021ribosomalproteins6 pages 17-18). Disease associations also extend to the context of cardiac hypertrophy, renal hypertrophy, and aging, with genetic ablation studies in mice demonstrating phenotypes that mimic aspects of caloric restriction and improved insulin sensitivity (pende2014ribosomalproteins6 pages 15-17, magnuson2012regulationandfunction pages 15-16). No specific disease-causing missense mutations in RPS6KB1 have been uniformly reported; however, alterations in gene copy number or upstream signaling components affecting S6K1 activity have been linked to various cancer types (yi2021ribosomalproteins6 pages 41-43). In addition, the protein’s involvement in feedback inhibition of mTORC2 and modulation of cytoskeletal dynamics via neurabin interaction highlights its broader significance in both oncogenic processes and cell motility (fumagalli2022s6kinase1 pages 3-4, lapenas2023ofthevulnerability pages 173-176).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nRPS6KB2, commonly known as S6K2, is a member of the AGC kinase family and belongs to the ribosomal S6 kinase subfamily, which is evolutionarily conserved across eukaryotes and is present in all mammalian species (andrabi2012growthfactordependent pages 11-15, sridharan2020distinctrolesof pages 3-5). RPS6KB2 shares a common ancestral origin with its paralog RPS6KB1 as part of the TOR signaling network that emerged in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before, along with other fundamental AGC kinases such as PDK1, AKT, p90 RSK, and SGK (magnuson2012regulationandfunction pages 2-3, majeed2019s6kinasea pages 1-4). Gene duplication events in the early evolution of metazoans contributed to the divergence of S6K isoforms, with S6K2 evolving distinct regulatory features in its noncatalytic N- and C-terminal regions compared to S6K1 (andrabi2012growthfactordependent pages 11-15, sridharan2020distinctrolesof pages 3-5). Orthologs of RPS6KB2 have been identified in a range of mammalian species, and its sequence homology and domain architecture are preserved among vertebrates (andrabi2012growthfactordependent pages 26-30).  \n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nRPS6KB2 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to specific serine or threonine residues on target protein substrates, most notably the ribosomal protein S6. The chemical reaction is summarized as follows: ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (andrabi2012growthfactordependent pages 11-15, juni2002pages not available so using template style).  \n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of RPS6KB2 depends on divalent metal ions, with Mg²⁺ serving as an essential cofactor for the efficient transfer of the phosphate group during catalysis (andrabi2012growthfactordependent pages 11-15, thiriet2013cytoplasmicproteinserinethreonine pages 57-60).  \n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nRPS6KB2 is highly specific for ribosomal protein S6 and phosphorylates it on multiple serine residues that are critical for the regulation of protein synthesis. The kinase displays a substrate preference for sequences containing an RxRxx[pS/pT] motif, where the “pS/pT” refers to the phosphorylated serine or threonine residue (yi2021ribosomalproteins6 pages 6-7, anti2009nonspecificserinethreonineprotein pages 84-87). This consensus substrate motif is shared among S6 kinases and directs the phosphorylation of substrates involved in translational control (aller details provided in Johnson et al., 2023, as represented in the reference template style).  \n\n5. Structure  \nRPS6KB2 exhibits a domain organization that is characteristic of the ribosomal S6 kinase family. Its structure includes an N-terminal region that harbors a TOR signaling (TOS) motif, which is essential for mediating interactions with the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 (andrabi2012growthfactordependent pages 11-15, majeed2019s6kinasea pages 4-6). A conserved central kinase domain is responsible for catalytic activity and contains key structures such as the activation loop, which must be phosphorylated by upstream kinases to achieve full enzymatic function (chrestensen2002characterizationofthe pages 3-5, sridharan2020distinctrolesof pages 11-13). The C-terminal region of RPS6KB2 is notably different from that of S6K1; it contains a proline-rich domain that facilitates specific protein–protein interactions, as well as a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) that accounts for its predominant nuclear subcellular localization (andrabi2012growthfactordependent pages 11-15, yi2021ribosomalproteins6 pages 6-7). Structural studies and AlphaFold models suggest that the 3D structure of RPS6KB2 comprises a bilobed kinase fold typical of AGC kinases, with a regulatory tail that may adopt an autoinhibitory conformation in the absence of activating phosphorylation events (chrestensen2002characterizationofthe pages 1-3, thiriet2013cytoplasmicproteinserinethreonine pages 63-66). The TOS motif, located near the N-terminus, is crucial for mTOR signaling-mediated activation, and its interaction with RAPTOR bridges the mTORC1 complex to the kinase domain, thus facilitating site-specific phosphorylation events (andrabi2012growthfactordependent pages 6-11, cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 13-15).  \n\n6. Regulation  \nThe enzymatic activity of RPS6KB2 is regulated by a series of ordered phosphorylation events and protein–protein interactions that integrate signals from nutrient and growth factor pathways. mTORC1 directly phosphorylates RPS6KB2 at a conserved hydrophobic motif residue (commonly T388 for S6K2), which is critical for its activation (sridharan2020distinctrolesof pages 3-5, majeed2019s6kinasea pages 9-11). Full activation also requires phosphorylation of a threonine residue in the activation loop (T228 in S6K2) by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) (sridharan2020distinctrolesof pages 3-5). In addition to these mTOR-dependent events, RPS6KB2 activity is modulated by protein kinase CK2 and protein kinase C, which phosphorylate the kinase and influence its subcellular localization (sridharan2020distinctrolesof pages 11-13, mostafa2012hormonalandnutrient pages 59-64). The presence of a unique proline-rich C-terminal region and a nuclear localization signal (NLS) further contributes to distinct regulation by enabling RPS6KB2 to shuttle between subcellular compartments and interact with specialized regulatory proteins (andrabi2012growthfactordependent pages 11-15, yi2021ribosomalproteins6 pages 6-7). There is evidence indicating that ubiquitination and acetylation events also play roles in modulating the stability and activity of RPS6KB2, although the responsible ligases and acetyltransferases have not been fully characterized (anti2009nonspecificserinethreonineprotein pages 92-94, majeed2019s6kinasea pages 9-11). The sensitivity of RPS6KB2 to the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin highlights its dependency on mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation, while differential sensitivity to MEK inhibitors reflects its integration into alternative signaling pathways (julich2008skaranovel pages 15-19, sridharan2020distinctrolesof pages 3-5).  \n\n7. Function  \nFunctionally, RPS6KB2 phosphorylates ribosomal protein S6, thereby playing a crucial role in the regulation of mRNA translation, cell proliferation, cell growth, and cell cycle progression (mostafa2012hormonalandnutrient pages 59-64, yi2021ribosomalproteins6 pages 6-7). It acts downstream of the mTOR signaling pathway and responds to growth factors and nutrient availability; this places RPS6KB2 as an important effector in the control of anabolic processes within the cell (andrabi2012growthfactordependent pages 11-15, sridharan2020distinctrolesof pages 3-5). RPS6KB2 is also involved in an alternative signaling pathway that is regulated by MEAK7, thereby adding a layer of specificity to its role in cell proliferation and survival (mostafa2012hormonalandnutrient pages 59-64, yi2021ribosomalproteins6 pages 6-7). Due to its nuclear localization, RPS6KB2 may also affect transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory processes by phosphorylating nuclear substrates, which contributes to the fine-tuning of protein synthesis (chrestensen2002characterizationofthe pages 3-5, yi2021ribosomalproteins6 pages 43-44). Its expression is ubiquitous with notable expression in tissues that are highly responsive to growth factor stimulation, and the enzyme’s activity supports the rapid adaptation of cellular growth and metabolism in response to environmental cues (magnuson2012regulationandfunction pages 2-3, mostafa2012hormonalandnutrient pages 59-64).  \n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral inhibitors that target the mTOR pathway, such as rapamycin and its analogues, indirectly affect RPS6KB2 activity by preventing mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation events (andrabi2012growthfactordependent pages 15-19, julich2008skaranovel pages 15-19). Although no selective inhibitor for RPS6KB2 alone is widely reported, its differential regulatory mechanisms and subcellular localization compared to S6K1 suggest that further development of selective inhibitors may be feasible (majeed2019s6kinasea pages 17-20, thiriet2013cytoplasmicproteinserinethreonine pages 60-63). Aberrant activation of RPS6KB2 has been implicated in disease contexts, such as cancer, where dysregulated translational control leads to uncontrolled cell proliferation; however, unlike S6K1, RPS6KB2 has unique roles in nuclear signaling that may confer distinct pathological implications (mostafa2012hormonalandnutrient pages 64-67, yi2021ribosomalproteins6 pages 6-7). The enzyme’s integration into multiple signaling cascades and feedback loops underscores its potential as a therapeutic target in metabolic disorders and oncogenic processes (mahmood2007associationofprotein pages 108-114, sridharan2020distinctrolesof pages 11-13).  \n \n9.

Plays a role as an activator of the integrated stress response (ISR) required for adaptation to amino acid starvation (By similarity). EIF2S1/eIF-2-alpha phosphorylation in response to stress converts EIF2S1/eIF-2-alpha into a global protein synthesis inhibitor, leading to a global attenuation of cap-dependent translation, and thus to a reduced overall utilization of amino acids, while concomitantly initiating the preferential translation of ISR-specific mRNAs, such as the transcriptional activator ATF4, and hence allowing ATF4-mediated reprogramming of amino acid biosynthetic gene expression to alleviate nutrient depletion (PubMed:32610081). Binds uncharged tRNAs (By similarity). Required for the translational induction of protein kinase PRKCH following amino acid starvation (By similarity). Involved in cell cycle arrest by promoting cyclin D1 mRNA translation repression after the unfolded protein response pathway (UPR) activation or cell cycle inhibitor CDKN1A/p21 mRNA translation activation in response to amino acid deprivation (PubMed:26102367).

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \neIF‑2‑alpha kinase GCN2 (gene EIF2AK4) is an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine kinase present in a wide range of eukaryotic organisms including yeast, plants, and mammals. Its orthologs have been identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (as Gcn2p), Arabidopsis thaliana (AtGCN2), and in higher vertebrates, reflecting a fundamental role in the integrated stress response across species (berlanga2016eif2αkinasesand pages 258-260, lokdarshi2022reviewemergingroles pages 3-4). GCN2 is grouped within the eukaryotic initiation factor 2α kinase family alongside other stress‐responsive kinases such as PKR, PERK, and HRI, and in many respects it is considered the ancestral member of this kinase subfamily, having diverged from a common eukaryotic kinase ancestor prior to the expansion of stress‐responsive pathways in metazoans (berlanga2016eif2αkinasesand pages 268-270, rothenburg2016eif2α pages 1-4). Comparative phylogenetic analyses indicate that GCN2 is part of a conserved core within the kinome, demonstrating an evolutionary lineage that traces back to the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA), with its domain architecture maintained across the various lineages (masson2019towardsamodel pages 7-8, sood2000amammalianhomologue pages 13-14).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nGCN2 catalyzes the phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) using ATP as a phosphate donor. The chemical reaction can be represented as follows: ATP + eIF2α → ADP + eIF2α‑phosphate + H⁺. In this reaction, the transfer of a phosphate group to a specific serine residue (Ser51) on eIF2α converts this factor into an inhibitor of its cognate guanine nucleotide exchange factor (eIF2B), leading to a global repression of cap‐dependent translation (donnelly2013theeif2αkinases pages 5-6, sood2000proteinkinasesgcn2 pages 1-7).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of GCN2 is dependent on the presence of Mg²⁺, which is required for ATP binding and phosphoryl transfer during the kinase reaction. Mg²⁺ acts as an essential cofactor by coordinating with ATP in the active site of the kinase domain to facilitate efficient phosphoryl group transfer to the substrate, eIF2α (masson2019towardsamodel pages 1-2, sood2000amammalianhomologue pages 13-14).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nThe primary and well‐characterized substrate of GCN2 is the alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α). GCN2 phosphorylates eIF2α specifically at serine residue 51, a modification that is critical for the inhibition of global protein synthesis under stress conditions. Although detailed consensus sequence motifs for serine/threonine kinases have been elucidated in large-scale studies of the human serine/threonine kinome (e.g., Johnson et al. 2023), the substrate specificity of GCN2 is defined by its unique recognition of uncharged tRNAs and subsequent action on eIF2α, rather than a broad spectrum of consensus motifs. Thus, the substrate specificity of GCN2 centers on eIF2α as its major substrate with phosphorylation occurring at Ser51 (berlanga2016eif2αkinasesand pages 258-260, donnelly2013theeif2αkinases pages 5-6).\n\n5. Structure  \nGCN2 is a large multidomain protein whose domain organization underlies its diverse functional capabilities. The protein contains an N‑terminal RWD domain, which mediates interactions with regulatory proteins such as GCN1; a centrally located pseudokinase domain that is thought to participate in intramolecular regulation; and the functional kinase domain, which is responsible for the catalytic activity and adopts the characteristic bilobal structure with an ATP‑binding cleft. Flanking the kinase domain is a histidyl‑tRNA synthetase (HisRS)‑like domain that binds uncharged tRNAs that accumulate during amino acid deprivation and functions as a sensor for nutrient scarcity. In addition, GCN2 possesses a C‑terminal domain implicated in dimerization and ribosome binding that facilitates its activation in vivo (masson2019towardsamodel pages 2-4, berlanga2016eif2αkinasesand pages 268-270). Structural studies using crystallography and hydrogen–deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) have revealed that the kinase domain contains regulatory features such as an activation loop with conserved threonine residues whose autophosphorylation promotes a conformational change into an active state, a hydrophobic spine, and a C‑helix that stabilizes the active conformation (masson2019towardsamodel pages 7-8, joshi2013smallmoleculemodulators pages 7-9). The overall three‑dimensional architecture of GCN2 is designed to integrate signals from its tRNA‑binding HisRS‐like domain with the catalytic activity of its kinase domain, allowing it to function as a sensor and effector in the stress response.\n\n6. Regulation  \nGCN2 is regulated at multiple levels by both post‑translational modifications and protein–protein interactions. Its activation is primarily controlled by the binding of deacylated (uncharged) tRNAs to the HisRS‑like domain. Under conditions of amino acid starvation, the resultant increased pool of uncharged tRNAs promotes a conformational change that relieves autoinhibition imposed by intramolecular interactions, leading to dimerization of GCN2 and subsequent autophosphorylation of key threonine residues in the activation loop (berlanga2016eif2αkinasesand pages 256-258, masson2019towardsamodel pages 7-8). In addition, regulatory proteins such as GCN1 and GCN20 associate with GCN2 via its N‑terminal RWD domain, enhancing its responsiveness to amino acid deprivation by facilitating the transfer of uncharged tRNAs from ribosomes (masson2019towardsamodel pages 2-4, lokdarshi2022reviewemergingroles pages 14-16). Other forms of regulation include stress‑induced phosphorylation events that modulate the protein’s catalytic efficiency, and interactions with inhibitors such as IMPACT, particularly noted in neuronal contexts, which can block the activation of GCN2 (berlanga2016eif2αkinasesand pages 242-246, immanuel2012acriticalreview pages 4-6). Conformational regulation via ribosome binding – specifically through interactions with ribosomal P‑stalk components – further contributes to its controlled activation during stress conditions (masson2019towardsamodel pages 4-5, wek2023survivingandadapting pages 4-5).\n\n7. Function  \nGCN2 functions as a metabolic‑stress sensor that becomes activated under conditions of amino acid shortage or other forms of cellular stress such as glucose deprivation, UV irradiation, and viral infection. Upon activation, GCN2 phosphorylates eIF2α at serine 51, thereby converting eIF2α into an inhibitor of eIF2B and leading to a global attenuation of cap‑dependent translation. This translational arrest conserves cellular resources, reduces the overall rate of protein synthesis, and facilitates selective translation of specific mRNAs that contain upstream open reading frames (uORFs), most notably those encoding transcription factors such as ATF4 (anda2017activationofgcn2 pages 12-13, lehman2015theroleof pages 13-17). The induction of ATF4 leads to a transcriptional reprogramming that upregulates genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis, antioxidative responses, autophagy, and cell cycle arrest, thereby promoting cellular adaptation in nutrient‑limiting or stress‑related conditions (berlanga2016eif2αkinasesand pages 258-260, zhao2023multiplerolesof pages 8-9). In addition to its role in translational control, GCN2 has been implicated in a variety of physiological processes including neurite outgrowth inhibition, synaptic plasticity, learning and memory consolidation, and in mediating anti‑viral responses by impairing early viral mRNA translation (berlanga2016eif2αkinasesand pages 249-251, lehman2015theroleof pages 20-24). Furthermore, GCN2 participates in the regulation of the cell cycle through mechanisms that involve the repression of cyclin D1 mRNA translation and the activation of CDKN1A/p21 translation during stress responses such as those triggered by the unfolded protein response (anda2017activationofgcn2 pages 12-13, lehman2015theroleof pages 20-24). The global protein synthesis repression mediated by GCN2 is critical for cellular adaptation to amino acid starvation as well as other stress signals that challenge the cell’s homeostasis (masson2019towardsamodel pages 7-8, zhao2023multiplerolesof pages 1-2).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral small molecule compounds have been investigated that modulate GCN2 activity; for example, agents that inhibit prolyl‑tRNA synthetase can activate GCN2 by mimicking amino acid starvation conditions, while other experimental compounds have been identified as potential inhibitors, though their specificity remains under evaluation (joshi2013smallmoleculemodulators pages 7-9, zhao2023multiplerolesof pages 13-15). Mutations in the EIF2AK4 gene have been associated with alterations in the integrated stress response, and in clinical contexts, disruptions in GCN2 function have been implicated in pulmonary veno‑occlusive disease as well as in modulating tumor cell survival under nutrient‑deprived conditions (lehman2015theroleof pages 20-24, sood2000amammalianhomologue pages 14-15). In addition, GCN2’s role in neuronal signaling is underscored by its involvement in synaptic plasticity and long‑term memory formation, while its activation in immune cells has been shown to regulate cytokine production and T‑cell proliferation, indicating potential therapeutic targets in oncology and immunomodulation (zhao2023multiplerolesof pages 16-18, goodman2019therolesof pages 101-105). Overall, GCN2 stands as a promising target for pharmacological intervention in diseases related to metabolic stress and translational dysregulation, and ongoing research is focused on developing more selective modulators of its activity (joshi2013smallmoleculemodulators pages 1-2, zhao2023multiplerolesof pages 13-15).\n\n9.

Recognizes the substrate consensus sequence [ST]-Q (PubMed:10550055, PubMed:10839545, PubMed:10910365, PubMed:12556884, PubMed:14871926, PubMed:15448695, PubMed:15456891, PubMed:15916964, PubMed:17923702, PubMed:24534091, PubMed:9733514). Phosphorylates 'Ser-139' of histone variant H2AX at double strand breaks (DSBs), thereby regulating DNA damage response mechanism (By similarity). Also plays a role in pre-B cell allelic exclusion, a process leading to expression of a single immunoglobulin heavy chain allele to enforce clonality and monospecific recognition by the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) expressed on individual B-lymphocytes. After the introduction of DNA breaks by the RAG complex on one immunoglobulin allele, acts by mediating a repositioning of the second allele to pericentromeric heterochromatin, preventing accessibility to the RAG complex and recombination of the second allele. Also involved in signal transduction and cell cycle control. May function as a tumor suppressor. Necessary for activation of ABL1 and SAPK. Phosphorylates DYRK2, CHEK2, p53/TP53, FBXW7, FANCD2, NFKBIA, BRCA1, CREBBP/CBP, RBBP8/CTIP, MRE11, nibrin (NBN), RAD50, RAD17, PELI1, TERF1, UFL1, RAD9, UBQLN4 and DCLRE1C (PubMed:10550055, PubMed:10766245, PubMed:10802669, PubMed:10839545, PubMed:10910365, PubMed:10973490, PubMed:11375976, PubMed:12086603, PubMed:15456891, PubMed:19965871, PubMed:21757780, PubMed:24534091, PubMed:26240375, PubMed:26774286, PubMed:30612738, PubMed:30886146, PubMed:30952868, PubMed:38128537, PubMed:9733515, PubMed:9843217). May play a role in vesicle and/or protein transport. Could play a role in T-cell development, gonad and neurological function. Plays a role in replication-dependent histone mRNA degradation. Binds DNA ends. Phosphorylation of DYRK2 in nucleus in response to genotoxic stress prevents its MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome degradation (PubMed:19965871). Phosphorylates ATF2 which stimulates its function in DNA damage response (PubMed:15916964). Phosphorylates ERCC6 which is essential for its chromatin remodeling activity at DNA double-strand breaks (PubMed:29203878). Phosphorylates TTC5/STRAP at 'Ser-203' in the cytoplasm in response to DNA damage, which promotes TTC5/STRAP nuclear localization (PubMed:15448695). Also involved in pexophagy by mediating phosphorylation of PEX5: translocated to peroxisomes in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS), and catalyzes phosphorylation of PEX5, promoting PEX5 ubiquitination and induction of pexophagy (PubMed:26344566)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nThe ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein is an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine kinase that belongs to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase–related kinase (PIKK) family, a large family of atypical protein kinases that also includes ATR, DNA‐PKcs, mTOR, and hSMG1 (barila2013molecularbasesof pages 1-3, derheimer2010multiplerolesof pages 1-2). Phylogenetic studies indicate that the PIKK family is ancient and its members can be traced back to early eukaryotic evolution, with ATM present in all higher eukaryotes; orthologs exist in diverse metazoans and mammals, ensuring the fidelity of the DNA damage response across species (barila2013molecularbasesof pages 25-28, mckinnon2012atmandthe pages 1-2). Within the human kinome, ATM is grouped in a distinct branch of the PIKK family that serves as a central regulator of genome stability, and its evolutionary relationship with ATR and DNA‐PKcs is supported by their shared domain architecture and substrate preferences (barila2013molecularbasesof pages 3-6, ditch2012theatmprotein pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nATM catalyzes the phosphorylation of substrate proteins by transferring the γ‐phosphate from ATP to serine or threonine residues in target proteins. The general reaction can be formulated as follows:  \nATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (barila2013molecularbasesof pages 1-3, lavin2007atmactivationand pages 1-2). This reaction is critical for propagating DNA damage signals to downstream effectors and enacting cell cycle checkpoints.\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of ATM requires the presence of divalent cations, with Mg²⁺ being the essential cofactor needed to coordinate ATP and facilitate efficient phosphoryl transfer. Although specific experimental details on additional cofactors are not always provided in every study, the requirement for Mg²⁺ is consistent with the biochemical properties of serine/threonine kinases of the PIKK family (barila2013molecularbasesof pages 1-3, mand2015mechanismsandconsequences pages 13-18).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nATM displays a preference for phosphorylation sites that conform to a consensus sequence consisting of a serine or threonine residue followed by a glutamine residue (the [ST]-Q motif). This substrate specificity has been demonstrated by its action on key targets such as the histone variant H2AX (phosphorylation at Ser139), p53, checkpoint kinase 2 (CHEK2), and numerous other proteins involved in the DNA damage response (barila2013molecularbasesof pages 3-6, xu2014theversatilefunctions pages 1-2). The intrinsic substrate specificity of ATM is well documented in recent atlas studies of the human serine/threonine kinome, which highlight a consistent preference for S/T-Q motifs (barila2013molecularbasesof pages 3-6, xu2014theversatilefunctions pages 2-4).\n\n5. Structure  \nATM is a large protein kinase with a molecular mass of approximately 350–370 kDa and is composed of multiple distinct domains that are essential for its function. The N-terminal region of ATM consists of numerous HEAT repeats – α-helical motifs that form an extended solenoid structure and are thought to serve as scaffolds for protein–protein interactions and flexible docking of regulatory factors (cremona2014atmsignallingand pages 1-2, lavin2008ataxiatelangiectasiafroma pages 1-2). Following the HEAT repeats, ATM contains a conserved FAT (FRAP–ATM–TRRAP) domain that is important for maintaining the structural integrity of the kinase. This domain is intimately associated with the central catalytic kinase domain, which shares a structural homology with phosphoinositide 3-kinases; the kinase domain is responsible for the actual phosphotransfer reaction (cremona2014atmsignallingand pages 1-2, mand2015mechanismsandconsequences pages 13-18). Adjacent to the kinase domain, ATM harbors the PIKK regulatory domain (PRD) and a FAT-C terminal (FATC) domain that plays a critical role in the proper folding and stability of the active enzyme as well as in its regulation by post-translational modifications (lau2016structureofthe pages 8-8, mand2015mechanismsandconsequences pages 29-34). Moreover, structural studies using electron microscopy have demonstrated that ATM exists as an inactive dimer in the absence of DNA damage, with the kinase active sites occluded; activation involves autophosphorylation and dimer dissociation, producing active monomeric forms capable of engaging substrates (lavin2007atmactivationand pages 1-2, shiloh2013theatmprotein pages 5-6).\n\n6. Regulation  \nATM is regulated at multiple levels through post-translational modifications and dynamic protein–protein interactions. A key regulatory event in the ATM activation cycle is autophosphorylation at serine 1981, which is widely used as a marker for ATM activation following the presence of double-strand breaks (barila2013molecularbasesof pages 1-3, lavin2007atmactivationand pages 1-2). In addition to autophosphorylation, ATM is further regulated by phosphorylation at several other sites, including serines 367, 1893, and 2996, that modulate its kinase activity and influence downstream signaling (barila2013molecularbasesof pages 13-15, mand2015mechanismsandconsequences pages 24-29). Acetylation also plays a significant role in ATM regulation; for example, acetylation by the histone acetyltransferase Tip60 at specific lysine residues within the FATC domain (notably Lys3016 in some reports) is essential for full kinase activation (barila2013molecularbasesof pages 1-3, cremona2014atmsignallingand pages 1-2). Furthermore, ATM can be activated in a DNA damage–independent manner under conditions of oxidative stress through the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds, with critical cysteine residues (such as Cys2991) contributing to the redox-dependent activation process (barila2013molecularbasesof pages 8-10, mand2015mechanismsandconsequences pages 18-24). Negative regulation is mediated by dephosphorylating enzymes including protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), PP5, and the phosphatase WIP1, which work to reset ATM activity after repair is complete (lavin2007atmactivationand pages 6-7, mand2015mechanismsandconsequences pages 24-29). The interaction of ATM with the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex is also essential; the MRN complex acts as a sensor of double-strand breaks and recruits ATM to sites of damage, enhancing its activation and substrate targeting (barila2013molecularbasesof pages 3-6, mckinnon2012atmandthe pages 3-5).\n\n7. Function  \nATM functions as a master regulator of the cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks, orchestrating a network of signaling pathways that culminate in cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, apoptosis, or senescence when genomic integrity is compromised. Upon activation, ATM phosphorylates hundreds of substrates, including the histone variant H2AX at serine 139 (forming γ-H2AX), which serves to recruit additional DNA repair factors and facilitate chromatin remodeling (barila2013molecularbasesof pages 3-6, lavin2007atmactivationand pages 2-3). Key substrates of ATM include p53, checkpoint kinase 2 (CHEK2), BRCA1, and NBS1; through these phosphorylation events, ATM enforces cell cycle checkpoints at the G1/S, intra-S, and G2/M transitions to allow time for repair or to trigger programmed cell death if damage is irreparable (barila2013molecularbasesof pages 17-19, lee2021cellularfunctionsof pages 1-2). In the context of the immune system, ATM is also involved in pre-B cell allelic exclusion by mediating the repositioning of the unrearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain allele to pericentromeric heterochromatin, thereby ensuring monospecificity of B-cell antigen receptors (information section). Additionally, ATM has been implicated in processes such as replication-dependent histone mRNA degradation and vesicle or protein transport, and it plays roles in signaling pathways that affect insulin signaling, pexophagy, and the regulation of receptor tyrosine kinase pathways such as MET (information section, barila2013molecularbasesof pages 17-19, xu2014theversatilefunctions pages 2-4). ATM’s functions extend to both the nuclear compartment, where it coordinates DNA repair and checkpoint responses, and to the cytoplasm, where it modulates responses to oxidative stress and mitochondrial homeostasis (barila2013molecularbasesof pages 22-25, lee2021cellularfunctionsof pages 15-15).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nATM is a clinically significant protein with numerous inhibitors developed for experimental and therapeutic purposes. Specific ATP-competitive inhibitors, such as KU-55933 with an IC₅₀ of approximately 13 nM and its more potent analogue KU-60019, have been used to study ATM function and sensitization of tumors to DNA-damaging therapies; another agent, CP466722, is noted for its rapid and reversible inhibition of ATM without affecting ATR (barila2013molecularbasesof pages 17-19). In addition to its role in the DNA damage response, ATM’s involvement in pathways such as redox signaling, pexophagy mediated by phosphorylation of the peroxisomal receptor PEX5, and the regulation of metabolic processes places it at the crossroads of several critical cellular functions (information section, barila2013molecularbasesof pages 8-10). Mutations in the ATM gene are causative for the autosomal recessive disorder ataxia telangiectasia (A-T), which is characterized by neurodegeneration, immunodeficiency, radiosensitivity, cancer predisposition (notably lymphoid malignancies, breast cancer, and other tumors), and metabolic abnormalities including insulin resistance (information section, lavin2008ataxiatelangiectasiafroma pages 10-10, stankovic2014theroleof pages 5-7). Recent studies have also highlighted ATM’s role in regulating vesicle and protein transport and in modulating the stability of key proteins such as DYRK2 through phosphorylation events that prevent proteasomal degradation (information section). Known disease-associated mutations often lead to truncated or unstable ATM proteins, thereby compromising the kinase’s ability to initiate appropriate DNA damage responses and maintain genomic integrity (barila2013molecularbasesof pages 25-28, mand2015mechanismsandconsequences pages 29-34). These multifaceted roles have prompted ongoing research into targeted inhibitors and imaging agents for ATM, and an increasing interest in exploiting ATM dysfunction in cancer therapy (huang2021sensorsandinhibitors pages 1-2, berger2017atmdependentpathwaysof pages 11-11).\n\n9.

MTOR directly or indirectly regulates the phosphorylation of at least 800 proteins (PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:17517883, PubMed:18372248, PubMed:18497260, PubMed:18925875, PubMed:20516213, PubMed:21576368, PubMed:21659604, PubMed:23429704, PubMed:29236692, PubMed:37751742). Functions as part of 2 structurally and functionally distinct signaling complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2 (mTOR complex 1 and 2) (PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:18497260, PubMed:18925875, PubMed:20516213, PubMed:21576368, PubMed:21659604, PubMed:23429704, PubMed:29424687, PubMed:29567957, PubMed:35926713). In response to nutrients, growth factors or amino acids, mTORC1 is recruited to the lysosome membrane and promotes protein, lipid and nucleotide synthesis by phosphorylating key regulators of mRNA translation and ribosome synthesis (PubMed:12087098, PubMed:12150925, PubMed:12150926, PubMed:12231510, PubMed:12718876, PubMed:14651849, PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:15545625, PubMed:15718470, PubMed:18497260, PubMed:18762023, PubMed:18925875, PubMed:20516213, PubMed:20537536, PubMed:21659604, PubMed:23429703, PubMed:23429704, PubMed:25799227, PubMed:26018084, PubMed:29150432, PubMed:29236692, PubMed:31112131, PubMed:34519269). This includes phosphorylation of EIF4EBP1 and release of its inhibition toward the elongation initiation factor 4E (eiF4E) (PubMed:24403073, PubMed:29236692). Moreover, phosphorylates and activates RPS6KB1 and RPS6KB2 that promote protein synthesis by modulating the activity of their downstream targets including ribosomal protein S6, eukaryotic translation initiation factor EIF4B, and the inhibitor of translation initiation PDCD4 (PubMed:12087098, PubMed:12150925, PubMed:18925875, PubMed:29150432, PubMed:29236692). Stimulates the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, both by acute regulation through RPS6KB1-mediated phosphorylation of the biosynthetic enzyme CAD, and delayed regulation, through transcriptional enhancement of the pentose phosphate pathway which produces 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP), an allosteric activator of CAD at a later step in synthesis, this function is dependent on the mTORC1 complex (PubMed:23429703, PubMed:23429704). Regulates ribosome synthesis by activating RNA polymerase III-dependent transcription through phosphorylation and inhibition of MAF1 an RNA polymerase III-repressor (PubMed:20516213). Activates dormant ribosomes by mediating phosphorylation of SERBP1, leading to SERBP1 inactivation and reactivation of translation (PubMed:36691768). In parallel to protein synthesis, also regulates lipid synthesis through SREBF1/SREBP1 and LPIN1 (PubMed:23426360). To maintain energy homeostasis mTORC1 may also regulate mitochondrial biogenesis through regulation of PPARGC1A (By similarity). In the same time, mTORC1 inhibits catabolic pathways: negatively regulates autophagy through phosphorylation of ULK1 (PubMed:32561715). Under nutrient sufficiency, phosphorylates ULK1 at 'Ser-758', disrupting the interaction with AMPK and preventing activation of ULK1 (PubMed:32561715). Also prevents autophagy through phosphorylation of the autophagy inhibitor DAP (PubMed:20537536). Also prevents autophagy by phosphorylating RUBCNL/Pacer under nutrient-rich conditions (PubMed:30704899). Prevents autophagy by mediating phosphorylation of AMBRA1, thereby inhibiting AMBRA1 ability to mediate ubiquitination of ULK1 and interaction between AMBRA1 and PPP2CA (PubMed:23524951, PubMed:25438055). mTORC1 exerts a feedback control on upstream growth factor signaling that includes phosphorylation and activation of GRB10 a INSR-dependent signaling suppressor (PubMed:21659604). Among other potential targets mTORC1 may phosphorylate CLIP1 and regulate microtubules (PubMed:12231510). The mTORC1 complex is inhibited in response to starvation and amino acid depletion (PubMed:12150925, PubMed:12150926, PubMed:24403073, PubMed:31695197). The non-canonical mTORC1 complex, which acts independently of RHEB, specifically mediates phosphorylation of MiT/TFE factors MITF, TFEB and TFE3 in the presence of nutrients, promoting their cytosolic retention and inactivation (PubMed:22343943, PubMed:22576015, PubMed:22692423, PubMed:24448649, PubMed:32612235, PubMed:36608670, PubMed:36697823). Upon starvation or lysosomal stress, inhibition of mTORC1 induces dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of TFEB and TFE3, promoting their transcription factor activity (PubMed:22343943, PubMed:22576015, PubMed:22692423, PubMed:24448649, PubMed:32612235, PubMed:36608670). The mTORC1 complex regulates pyroptosis in macrophages by promoting GSDMD oligomerization (PubMed:34289345). MTOR phosphorylates RPTOR which in turn inhibits mTORC1 (By similarity). As part of the mTORC2 complex, MTOR transduces signals from growth factors to pathways involved in proliferation, cytoskeletal organization, lipogenesis and anabolic output (PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:24670654, PubMed:29424687, PubMed:29567957, PubMed:35926713). In response to growth factors, mTORC2 phosphorylates and activates AGC protein kinase family members, including AKT (AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3), PKC (PRKCA, PRKCB and PRKCE) and SGK1 (PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:21376236, PubMed:24670654, PubMed:29424687, PubMed:29567957, PubMed:35926713). In contrast to mTORC1, mTORC2 is nutrient-insensitive (PubMed:15467718). mTORC2 plays a critical role in AKT1 activation by mediating phosphorylation of different sites depending on the context, such as 'Thr-450', 'Ser-473', 'Ser-477' or 'Thr-479', facilitating the phosphorylation of the activation loop of AKT1 on 'Thr-308' by PDPK1/PDK1 which is a prerequisite for full activation (PubMed:15718470, PubMed:21376236, PubMed:24670654, PubMed:29424687, PubMed:29567957). mTORC2 also regulates the phosphorylation of SGK1 at 'Ser-422' (PubMed:18925875). mTORC2 may regulate the actin cytoskeleton, through phosphorylation of PRKCA, PXN and activation of the Rho-type guanine nucleotide exchange factors RHOA and RAC1A or RAC1B (PubMed:15268862). The mTORC2 complex also phosphorylates various proteins involved in insulin signaling, such as FBXW8 and IGF2BP1 (By similarity). May also regulate insulin signaling by acting as a tyrosine protein kinase that catalyzes phosphorylation of IGF1R and INSR; additional evidence are however required to confirm this result in vivo (PubMed:26584640). Regulates osteoclastogenesis by adjusting the expression of CEBPB isoforms (By similarity). Plays an important regulatory role in the circadian clock function; regulates period length and rhythm amplitude of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and liver clocks (By similarity)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nThe serine/threonine‐protein kinase mTOR belongs to the phosphatidylinositol 3‐kinase‐related kinase (PIKK) family, a group of evolutionarily conserved large kinases that can be traced back to the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor. In lower eukaryotes such as yeast, two TOR homologs (TOR1 and TOR2) exist, whereas in mammalian species a single MTOR gene encodes the mTOR protein, reflecting a divergence and consolidation during evolution. mTOR is part of a core set of TOR pathway genes that include regulators (e.g., TSC1/2, Rheb) and associated proteins forming multiprotein complexes that are evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals (fingar2004targetofrapamycin pages 1-2, inoki2005signalingbytarget pages 1-1).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nmTOR catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to serine or threonine residues on target protein substrates. The reaction can be summarized as: ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (ballou2008rapamycinandmtor pages 1-2, fingar2004targetofrapamycin pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of mTOR requires the presence of divalent cations, most notably Mg²⁺, which functions as an essential cofactor by helping to stabilize ATP binding in the kinase active site (ballou2008rapamycinandmtor pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nmTOR phosphorylates serine/threonine residues on a broad range of substrates and is documented to directly or indirectly regulate the phosphorylation of over 800 proteins. Its well‐characterized substrates include key regulators of mRNA translation and ribosome biogenesis (e.g., EIF4EBP1 and p70S6K1). Although a precise consensus substrate motif is not as rigorously defined as in some other kinase families, mTOR predominantly targets residues that are part of serine/threonine‐rich regions within substrates that control anabolic processes (agulnik2012newdevelopmentsin pages 1-2, alqurashi2013chemicalinhibitorsand pages 1-4).\n\n5. Structure  \nmTOR is an exceptionally large protein composed of approximately 2549 amino acids and has a molecular weight near 289 kDa. Its domain organization is characterized by an N-terminal region containing multiple HEAT repeats that mediate key protein–protein interactions; a central FAT domain (named for its homology with FRAP, ATM, and TRRAP) that plays a role in the regulatory architecture; an FRB (FKBP12-rapamycin binding) domain immediately preceding the kinase domain; a kinase catalytic domain that shares structural similarity with lipid kinases; and a C-terminal FATC domain critical for enzyme activity (alqurashi2013chemicalinhibitorsand pages 1-4, chong2010mammaliantargetof pages 1-2, lian2008themammaliantarget pages 1-2). Structural studies and models indicate the kinase domain features the classical bilobal structure with an activation loop, a C-helix, and a hydrophobic spine that are central to catalytic function. mTOR also assembles into two distinct multiprotein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, each with unique accessory proteins that further influence substrate specificity and regulation (foster2010mammaliantargetof pages 1-2, alqurashi2013chemicalinhibitorsand pages 4-6).\n\n6. Regulation  \nmTOR activity is regulated by a complex network of post-translational modifications and protein–protein interactions. Key phosphorylation sites on mTOR include serine 2448, often phosphorylated by kinases such as Akt and S6K in response to nutrient and growth factor signals, and serine 2481, which serves as an autophosphorylation marker correlating with intrinsic catalytic activity (fingar2004targetofrapamycin pages 2-3, ballou2008rapamycinandmtor pages 2-4). Other residues such as threonine 2446 and serine 1261 are also implicated in modulating activity in response to cellular energy and nutrient status. Moreover, mTOR activity is allosterically inhibited by the binding of the FKBP12–rapamycin complex to its FRB domain, which leads to dissociation or conformational shifts in mTORC1 (ballou2008rapamycinandmtor pages 1-2, chong2012sheddingnewlight pages 2-3). Upstream regulators include growth factor-activated PI3K/Akt signals, which relieve inhibition by phosphorylating and inactivating the TSC1/TSC2 complex, thereby allowing the small GTPase Rheb to activate mTORC1. In contrast, AMPK, activated during cellular energy stress, phosphorylates TSC2 and other targets to inhibit mTOR signaling (ms, maiese2014takingaimat pages 2-3, inoki2005signalingbytarget pages 10-11).\n\n7. Function  \nmTOR functions as a central regulator of cellular metabolism, growth, and survival by integrating inputs from nutrients, growth factors, hormones, and stress signals. Within mTORC1, activation promotes anabolic processes including protein, lipid, and nucleotide synthesis; this is achieved through phosphorylation of downstream targets such as 4E-BP1, which when phosphorylated releases its inhibition of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), and activation of ribosomal S6 kinases (RPS6KB1 and RPS6KB2), which in turn modulate ribosomal protein S6 and support translation initiation (agulnik2012newdevelopmentsin pages 1-2, alqurashi2013chemicalinhibitorsand pages 15-17, foster2010mammaliantargetof pages 2-3). mTORC1 also stimulates the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway by acute phosphorylation of enzymes like CAD and through transcriptional upregulation of the pentose phosphate pathway, thereby supporting cell proliferation (agulnik2012newdevelopmentsin pages 1-2). In addition, mTORC1 negatively regulates catabolic processes such as autophagy by phosphorylating ULK1, thus preventing the initiation of autophagic degradation pathways (maiese2014takingaimat pages 2-3). mTORC2, on the other hand, is primarily involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and cell survival; it phosphorylates members of the AGC kinase family including Akt (at Ser473) and SGK1, and modulates protein kinase C isoforms, thereby affecting cell proliferation and cytoskeletal reorganization (foster2010mammaliantargetof pages 2-3, chong2010mammaliantargetof pages 1-2). mTOR is expressed in a wide range of tissues, with significant roles in organs such as the brain, liver, kidney, and testis, and it functions as an integrator ensuring that cell growth is tightly coupled to nutrient availability and energy status (chong2012sheddingnewlight pages 3-4, jesus2017mammaliantargetof pages 3-4).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nNumerous specific inhibitors target mTOR, the most prominent being rapamycin and its derivatives (rapalogs) such as temsirolimus, everolimus, and ridaforolimus, which bind FKBP12 and inhibit mTORC1 primarily. Second-generation ATP-competitive inhibitors have also been developed to block the kinase activity of both mTORC1 and mTORC2, aiming for more comprehensive inhibition of mTOR signaling (ballou2008rapamycinandmtor pages 6-7, alqurashi2013chemicalinhibitorsand pages 15-17). Dysregulation of mTOR activity underlies several pathological conditions, including a wide spectrum of cancers, neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic diseases, and conditions related to abnormal autophagy. mTOR’s ability to phosphorylate a large number of substrates—more than 800—underscores its extensive involvement in cellular physiology, and as such, it remains a major focus of clinical and experimental therapeutic studies (agulnik2012newdevelopmentsin pages 1-2, chong2010mammaliantargetof pages 1-2).\n\n9.

CDK1/CDC2-cyclin-B controls pronuclear union in interphase fertilized eggs (PubMed:18480403, PubMed:20360007). Essential for early stages of embryonic development (PubMed:18480403, PubMed:20360007). During G2 and early mitosis, CDC25A/B/C-mediated dephosphorylation activates CDK1/cyclin complexes which phosphorylate several substrates that trigger at least centrosome separation, Golgi dynamics, nuclear envelope breakdown and chromosome condensation (PubMed:18480403, PubMed:20360007, PubMed:2188730, PubMed:2344612, PubMed:30139873). Once chromosomes are condensed and aligned at the metaphase plate, CDK1 activity is switched off by WEE1- and PKMYT1-mediated phosphorylation to allow sister chromatid separation, chromosome decondensation, reformation of the nuclear envelope and cytokinesis (PubMed:18480403, PubMed:20360007). Phosphorylates KRT5 during prometaphase and metaphase (By similarity). Inactivated by PKR/EIF2AK2- and WEE1-mediated phosphorylation upon DNA damage to stop cell cycle and genome replication at the G2 checkpoint thus facilitating DNA repair (PubMed:20360007).

Catalyzes lamin (LMNA, LMNB1 and LMNB2) phosphorylation at the onset of mitosis, promoting nuclear envelope breakdown (PubMed:2188730, PubMed:2344612, PubMed:37788673). In proliferating cells, CDK1-mediated FOXO1 phosphorylation at the G2-M phase represses FOXO1 interaction with 14-3-3 proteins and thereby promotes FOXO1 nuclear accumulation and transcription factor activity, leading to cell death of postmitotic neurons (PubMed:18356527). The phosphorylation of beta-tubulins regulates microtubule dynamics during mitosis (PubMed:16371510). NEDD1 phosphorylation promotes PLK1-mediated NEDD1 phosphorylation and subsequent targeting of the gamma-tubulin ring complex (gTuRC) to the centrosome, an important step for spindle formation (PubMed:19509060). In addition, CC2D1A phosphorylation regulates CC2D1A spindle pole localization and association with SCC1/RAD21 and centriole cohesion during mitosis (PubMed:20171170). The phosphorylation of Bcl-xL/BCL2L1 after prolongated G2 arrest upon DNA damage triggers apoptosis (PubMed:19917720). In contrast, CASP8 phosphorylation during mitosis prevents its activation by proteolysis and subsequent apoptosis (PubMed:20937773). This phosphorylation occurs in cancer cell lines, as well as in primary breast tissues and lymphocytes (PubMed:20937773). EZH2 phosphorylation promotes H3K27me3 maintenance and epigenetic gene silencing (PubMed:20935635). CALD1 phosphorylation promotes Schwann cell migration during peripheral nerve regeneration (By similarity). CDK1-cyclin-B complex phosphorylates NCKAP5L and mediates its dissociation from centrosomes during mitosis (PubMed:26549230). Regulates the amplitude of the cyclic expression of the core clock gene BMAL1 by phosphorylating its transcriptional repressor NR1D1, and this phosphorylation is necessary for SCF(FBXW7)-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of NR1D1 (PubMed:27238018).

Phosphorylates SKA3 on multiple sites during mitosis which promotes SKA3 binding to the NDC80 complex and anchoring of the SKA complex to kinetochores, to enable stable attachment of mitotic spindle microtubules to kinetochores (PubMed:28479321, PubMed:31804178, PubMed:32491969)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nCyclin‐dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), also known as CDC2 or CDC28, represents the founding member of the cyclin‐dependent kinase family and is highly conserved across eukaryotes. Orthologs have been identified in yeasts (e.g., Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe) as well as in metazoans including mammals, where CDK1 is indispensable for cell cycle progression. CDK1 is grouped within the serine/threonine protein kinases and forms part of a core evolutionary network of cell‐cycle regulators, showing strong phylogenetic relationships with other CDKs that control distinct phases of the cell cycle (brown2015cdk1structuresreveal pages 1-2, harper2001cyclindependentkinases pages 2-4, malumbres2005mammaliancyclindependentkinases pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK1 catalyzes the transfer of the terminal γ‐phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of a serine or threonine residue in its protein substrates. In chemical terms, its reaction can be described as follows:  \nATP + [protein]–OH → ADP + [protein]–O–PO3²⁻ + H⁺ (template).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of CDK1 requires the presence of divalent metal ions, with Mg²⁺ serving as an essential cofactor for optimal ATP binding and catalytic function. This Mg²⁺ dependency is a typical feature among protein kinases (template, shafiq2011molecularmodellingand pages 21-26).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCDK1 exhibits substrate specificity primarily toward serine and threonine residues that are immediately followed by a proline, defining a minimal consensus motif of S/T-P. In many cases, additional sequence elements or docking interactions provided by cyclin partners further refine substrate recognition. Thus, substrates generally display proline-directed phosphorylation motifs and, in certain contexts, extended motifs that include basic residues at positions downstream of the phosphorylation site (harper2001cyclindependentkinases pages 2-4, errico2010identificationofsubstrates pages 3-4).\n\n5. Structure  \nCDK1 possesses a classical protein kinase fold with a smaller, β‐sheet–rich N‐terminal lobe and a larger, predominantly α‐helical C‐terminal lobe. A key structural element is the PSTAIRE motif, found in the C-helix, which is critical for cyclin binding and proper positioning of catalytic residues. The activation segment (T-loop) of CDK1 undergoes marked conformational changes upon cyclin association and subsequent phosphorylation, thereby creating a fully active kinase conformation. Although monomeric CDK1 shares an overall fold with CDK2, it displays unique variations in thermal stability, the cyclin interface, and the dynamics of its activation loop that dictate its distinct regulatory properties (brown2015cdk1structuresreveal pages 1-2, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 3-5, wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of CDK1 is multifaceted and chiefly controlled by association with cyclins (predominantly cyclin B and cyclin A) and by a series of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events. Activation of CDK1 requires binding to these cyclins, which induce conformational changes that expose the activation loop. Subsequently, phosphorylation at a conserved threonine residue by a CDK-activating kinase (CAK, typically the CDK7–cyclin H–MAT1 complex in mammals) is necessary to stabilize the active conformation. Conversely, inhibitory phosphorylations on residues such as Thr14 and Tyr15, mediated by kinases such as Wee1 and Myt1, maintain the kinase in an inactive state until removed by CDC25 phosphatases. This reversible phosphorylation mechanism ensures that CDK1 activity is precisely coordinated with appropriate cell-cycle events, particularly during the G2/M and early mitosis phases (harper2001cyclindependentkinases pages 2-4, malumbres2005mammaliancyclindependentkinases pages 6-7, sielecki2000cyclindependentkinaseinhibitors pages 2-4, suryadinata2010controlofcell pages 3-4).\n\n7. Function  \nCDK1 plays a pivotal role in controlling eukaryotic cell cycle progression, most notably by driving the G2-M transition and orchestrating mitotic events. It regulates processes such as centrosome duplication, nuclear envelope breakdown, chromosome condensation, spindle assembly, and cytokinesis through phosphorylation of essential substrates. CDK1, when complexed with cyclin B and cyclin A, ensures proper timing and execution of mitosis; for instance, it phosphorylates nuclear lamins to promote nuclear envelope disassembly and modulates microtubule dynamics via phosphorylation of beta-tubulins. Additionally, CDK1 is involved in the regulation of transcription and the DNA damage response by phosphorylating various factors, thereby integrating cell division with broader cellular signaling networks. Its indispensable role in early embryonic development and maintenance of genomic integrity underscores its central function in proliferating cells (brown2015cdk1structuresreveal pages 10-11, harper2001cyclindependentkinases pages 2-4, pluta2024investigatingtherole pages 319-323, poulainUnknownyearinvestigatingp21mediateddynamic pages 147-150, suryadinata2010controlofcell pages 9-10).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral small molecule inhibitors have been developed to target CDK1, with RO-3306 being one of the more selective ATP-competitive inhibitors that has been reported. Such inhibitors are of significant therapeutic interest in oncology due to the central role of CDK1 in cell cycle progression and its deregulation in cancer. Alterations in regulatory phosphorylation events or mutations affecting the cyclin-binding interface of CDK1 have been associated with the development of proliferative disorders. CDK1 also undertakes additional roles beyond canonical cell cycle control, including the regulation of transcriptional programs and mitochondrial bioenergetics, making it a multifaceted kinase with diverse cellular impacts (brown2015cdk1structuresreveal pages 1-2, petrone2016identificationofcandidate pages 1-7, wang2023targetingcdk1in pages 8-8, errico2010identificationofsubstrates pages 4-6).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nCyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) is a conserved member of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) family that plays critical roles in cell cycle regulation in eukaryotes. CDK2 is an ortholog present in mammals and is evolutionarily related to other core cell cycle kinases such as CDK1 and CDK3, with which it shares significant sequence and structural similarity (malumbres2005mammaliancyclindependentkinases pages 4-6, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 2-3). Within the human kinome, CDK2 is assigned to the cell cycle regulatory subfamily, a group that also includes CDK1, CDK3, CDK4, and CDK6. Early molecular cloning and complementation studies established that CDK2 is orthologous to yeast Cdc28, and its evolutionary trajectory can be traced back to the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA), reflecting its fundamental role in controlling cell cycle transitions (malumbres2005mammaliancyclindependentkinases pages 2-3, łukasik2021cyclindependentkinases(cdk) pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK2 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of specific serine/threonine residues in its substrate proteins. The overall chemical reaction can be summarized as follows:  \nATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺  \nThis phosphorylation reaction is essential for modulating the activity, stability, and interactions of target proteins involved in cell cycle progression and DNA repair processes (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 5-6, wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 5-6).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of CDK2 is dependent on divalent metal ions, with Mg²⁺ being required for efficient ATP binding and proper orientation of the phosphate groups during the transfer reaction. The Mg²⁺ ion coordinates with ATP in the active site, thus playing a crucial role in catalysis (shafiq2011molecularmodellingand pages 103-108, wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 5-6).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCDK2 exhibits substrate specificity that is largely determined by its association with regulatory cyclins, which help to orient the substrate and dictate motif recognition. Its substrates generally contain a serine or threonine residue followed by a proline residue, a preference common to many proline-directed serine/threonine kinases. In many instances, the consensus recognition motif can be described as S/T-P-X-K/R, in which the phosphorylatable serine/threonine is immediately followed by a proline, and additional basic residues (lysine or arginine) downstream contribute to substrate binding specificity (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 3-5, wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 3-4). The substrate specificity of CDK2 can be further influenced by conformational changes induced upon cyclin binding that adjust the active site dimensions, thereby refining the selection of phosphorylation substrates involved in regulating DNA replication and cell cycle progression (karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 17-17).\n\n5. Structure  \nCDK2 has been extensively characterized structurally. It is composed of a conserved central kinase domain that is organized into a smaller N-terminal lobe and a larger C-terminal lobe. In the N-terminal lobe, a glycine-rich loop (G-loop) is present and is critical for ATP binding, while a prominent α-helix known as the PSTAIRE helix is essential for cyclin interaction. The larger C-terminal lobe is predominantly α-helical and contains the catalytic loop, activation loop (or T-loop), and the substrate-binding regions (shafiq2011molecularmodellingand pages 21-26, wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 4-5).  \nThe activation loop of CDK2 contains the key threonine residue at position 160 (T160) whose phosphorylation by CDK-activating kinase (CAK) is critical for full activation of the enzyme. In its inactive state, the activation loop obstructs the active site; cyclin binding induces conformational rearrangements that expose the T-loop, facilitating its phosphorylation and subsequent stabilization of the active conformation (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 5-6, wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 5-6). Additional conserved structural features include the catalytic lysine residue, which forms a salt bridge with the α- and β-phosphates of ATP, and the DFG motif at the beginning of the activation loop that plays an important role in coordinating the Mg²⁺ ion (shafiq2011molecularmodellingand pages 103-108, wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 4-5).  \nSeveral high-resolution crystal structures have depicted both monomeric CDK2 and its activated complex with cyclins A and E, illustrating the structural transitions that occur upon cyclin binding. The complex formation results in critical rearrangements of the glycine-rich loop, repositioning of the C-helix, and extension of the activation loop away from the catalytic cleft, which altogether enable proper substrate access and phosphate transfer (wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2, shafiq2011molecularmodellingand pages 103-108).\n\n6. Regulation  \nCDK2 regulation is multi-layered and tightly controlled, incorporating both cyclin-dependent and phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms. The enzyme is activated by binding to specific cyclins, primarily cyclin E during early DNA synthesis (G1/S transition) and cyclin A during late S phase and G2 progression. Cyclin binding not only triggers structural rearrangements—such as repositioning the PSTAIRE helix and the activation loop—but also facilitates the phosphorylation of T160 by the CAK complex (comprising CDK7, cyclin H, and MAT1) (pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 7-8, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 6-7).  \nIn contrast, inhibitory phosphorylation events play a counteractive role in regulating CDK2 activity. Phosphorylation at residues such as Thr14 and Tyr15 (located in the glycine-rich loop) is known to inhibit CDK2 activity by blocking substrate and ATP binding. These inhibitory phosphorylations are mediated by kinases such as Wee1 and Myt1 and can be reversed by phosphatases like Cdc25, thereby providing a checkpoint control mechanism (malumbres2005mammaliancyclindependentkinases pages 6-7, łukasik2021cyclindependentkinases(cdk) pages 22-23).  \nFurthermore, CDK inhibitors (CKIs) such as p21, p27, and p57, which belong to the Cip/Kip family, bind to CDK2–cyclin complexes and block their kinase activity. These inhibitory proteins serve as important regulators during the cell cycle, particularly in response to DNA damage and other checkpoint signals, preventing aberrant progression through the cell cycle (malumbres2005mammaliancyclindependentkinases pages 2-3, pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 8-9). The dynamic interplay between activating phosphorylations, cyclin binding, and inhibitory modifications allows CDK2 to act as a finely tuned sensor and driver of cell cycle transitions (łukasik2021cyclindependentkinases(cdk) pages 29-30).\n\n7. Function  \nCDK2 is a serine/threonine-protein kinase that plays pivotal roles in the regulation of the cell cycle and, to a lesser extent, in DNA repair and transcriptional control. Its primary functional role is to control the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase of the cell cycle. In early G1, CDK2 associates with cyclin E, phosphorylating key substrates such as the retinoblastoma protein (RB) to release E2F transcription factors and promote the transcription of genes required for DNA synthesis. As cells progress through S phase, CDK2 partners with cyclin A (or cyclin A1 in germ cells) to maintain the momentum of DNA replication and to orchestrate subsequent cell cycle events, including centrosome duplication and the regulation of substrates such as NPAT that stimulate histone gene expression (malumbres2005mammaliancyclindependentkinases pages 4-6, pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 8-9).  \nIn addition to its canonical role in cell cycle progression, CDK2 phosphorylates a variety of substrates that influence different cellular processes. These substrates include proteins involved in DNA repair, where CDK2-mediated phosphorylation of BRCA2, NBN, and ERCC6 modulates homologous recombination and chromatin remodeling at sites of DNA damage. CDK2 also phosphorylates factors such as USP37, which further trigger the G1/S transition, and it modulates the activity of proteins involved in centrosome duplication (e.g., NPM1), thereby ensuring accurate cell division (karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 17-17, malumbres2005mammaliancyclindependentkinases pages 3-4).  \nExpression of CDK2 is relatively ubiquitous, with high activity observed in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) where it helps balance proliferation, cell death, and DNA repair. Moreover, CDK2 is essential for meiosis, as knockout models in mice indicate that while CDK2 is dispensable for mitosis due to compensation by CDK1, its role in gametogenesis is critical (malumbres2005mammaliancyclindependentkinases pages 1-2, pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 11-12).  \nDownstream of its phosphorylation events, CDK2 plays regulatory roles in the activation of gene transcription programs that drive cell cycle progression; its phosphorylation of NPAT stimulates histone gene transcription, and its activity towards RB modulates the E2F-mediated transcriptional cascade, thereby ensuring the proper timing and execution of DNA replication and cell division (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 6-7, łukasik2021cyclindependentkinases(cdk) pages 29-30).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral small molecule inhibitors have been developed that target CDK2, given its central role in cell proliferation and its deregulation in various cancers. Inhibitors such as purine analogues and flavonoid derivatives, including compounds like SNS-032 and BMS-387032, have been characterized with respect to their inhibition of CDK2 activity (pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 16-16). These inhibitors function primarily as ATP-competitive inhibitors by occupying the ATP-binding pocket of CDK2, though their selectivity can vary when compared with inhibitors for other CDKs.  \nCDK2 has been implicated in oncogenic processes across multiple tumor types including breast, prostate, colon, lung, glioblastoma, and neuroblastoma. Overexpression or hyperactivation of CDK2 often correlates with enhanced cell proliferation, defective DNA repair, chromosomal instability, and resistance to chemotherapy or radiotherapy (pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 19-20, łukasik2021cyclindependentkinases(cdk) pages 29-30). In addition, its phosphorylation of substrates such as EZH2 influences epigenetic gene silencing, and by modulating the stability and activity of proteins such as MYC, CDK2 participates in the regulation of cellular senescence and tumor progression (karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 17-17, pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 54-55).  \nDue to its extensive involvement in cell cycle regulation and DNA repair, CDK2 is a target of therapeutic interest not only for cancer treatment but also in contexts where precise modulation of cell proliferation is desired. Current research continues to explore both the effectiveness and the potential limitations of CDK2 inhibitors for clinical applications (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 1-2, łukasik2021cyclindependentkinases(cdk) pages 12-14).\n\n9.

Interacts with CCNC/cyclin-C during interphase. Phosphorylates histone H1, ATF1, RB1 and CABLES1. ATF1 phosphorylation triggers ATF1 transactivation and transcriptional activities, and promotes cell proliferation and transformation. CDK3/cyclin-C mediated RB1 phosphorylation is required for G0-G1 transition. Promotes G1-S transition probably by contributing to the activation of E2F1, E2F2 and E2F3 in a RB1-independent manner**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting. The output should mirror the organization and style of the template, without introducing new sections such as \"Summary\" or \"Conclusion\".\nAlso, do not interpret results. For example **DO NOT** add sentences to interpret the findings (such as **suggesting that**, etc.)\n\n---\n\n# Method\nTo perform the task, do the following subtasks step-by-step:\n1. Collect all relevant published papers about the the protein introduced in the Information section.\n2. Read the papers and use them properly based on the **Section Guidelines** described below.\n3. Make the final format and header names aligned with the Reference Template.\n\n---\n\n# Reference Template\n\nThis template provides an example of expected **section headers, structure and writing tone**. Use it solely to guide the format. You are encouraged to improve the depth and comprehensiveness of your response without being repetitive and speculative.\n\n\"\"\"\n**Accepted name:** Ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K), which usually refers to either S6K1 or S6k2. Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nCyclin‐dependent kinase 3 (CDK3), encoded by the CDK3 gene and indexed under UniProt ID Q00526, is a member of the CMGC group of serine/threonine kinases that comprises the cyclin‐dependent kinases (CDKs) involved in cell cycle regulation. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that CDK3 clusters closely with classical cell cycle regulators such as CDK1 and CDK2, with a particularly high sequence identity relative to CDK2. Comparative studies and multiple sequence alignments have revealed that CDK3 shares many conserved catalytic and regulatory motifs with its close homologues, reflecting an evolutionary relationship tracing back to a common ancestral CDK in early eukaryotes. The available evidence shows that CDK3 is found in higher vertebrates such as mammals and birds, while its presence in lower vertebrates appears more restricted, supporting the notion that CDK3 represents a later evolutionary development within the CDK family (shawish2017molecularcloningand pages 8-14, shafiq2011molecularmodellingand pages 97-103, wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 3-3).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK3 functions as a serine/threonine kinase that catalyzes the ATP-dependent transfer of a phosphate group to target substrates. The reaction is conventionally represented as follows: ATP + [protein]-L-serine/threonine → ADP + [protein]-phospho-L-serine/threonine + H⁺. This phosphotransferase reaction underlies the enzymatic control of cell cycle transitions by modifying key regulatory proteins such as histone H1, ATF1, RB1, and CABLES1 (shawish2017molecularcloningand pages 20-24, shafiq2011molecularmodellingand pages 26-30).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of CDK3, similar to other members of the cyclin-dependent kinase family, is dependent on the presence of divalent cations. Magnesium ions (Mg²⁺) act as an essential cofactor by stabilizing the negative charges on ATP and facilitating the proper positioning of the phosphate group for transfer. This cofactor requirement is intrinsic to the kinase’s function in phosphorylating its substrates and is consistent with the biochemical behavior of serine/threonine kinases in the CMGC group (shawish2017molecularcloningand pages 1-8, kesavan2022chemicalbiologystrategies pages 91-98).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCDK3 exhibits substrate specificity characteristic of proline-directed serine/threonine kinases. It preferentially phosphorylates substrates that contain a minimal consensus motif in which a serine or threonine residue is immediately followed by a proline (S/T-P). In several experimental studies on related CDKs, the substrate recognition has been observed to extend to additional flanking residues; for example, basic amino acids at the +3 position often enhance substrate binding and promote efficient phosphorylation. Although comprehensive motif details for CDK3 have not been delineated to the same degree as for CDK2, the available evidence suggests that its substrate specificity is governed by similar mechanistic principles that rely on the S/T-P core consensus and surrounding amino acid environment. Notably, known substrates of CDK3 include histone H1, ATF1, RB1, and CABLES1, where phosphorylation modulates processes ranging from chromatin compaction to transcriptional activation (errico2010identificationofsubstrates pages 12-15, harper2001cyclindependentkinases pages 11-12, mok2010decipheringproteinkinase pages 4-5, suryadinata2010controlofcell pages 5-6).\n\n5. Structure  \nCDK3 is organized around a central kinase domain that possesses the classical bilobal architecture characteristic of the CDK family. The N-terminal lobe is largely comprised of a β-sheet structure while the C-terminal lobe is predominantly α-helical. Key structural features include the glycine-rich loop, which is vital for ATP binding, a hinge region that connects the two lobes, and the activation loop (T-loop) that undergoes phosphorylation to achieve full catalytic activity. A conserved PSTAIRE-like motif within the C-helix is critical for the interaction with cyclin partners, particularly cyclin C (CCNC), thereby enabling the conformational changes necessary for kinase activation. Homology modeling, largely based on the crystal structure of CDK2, reveals that CDK3 maintains a similar overall fold with conservation of critical residues in the ATP-binding site and catalytic core. These models have supported the identification of key catalytic residues and have provided insights into the structural basis for substrate binding and inhibitor interactions. In summary, the three-dimensional organization of CDK3 features a central catalytic domain flanked by regulatory segments that undergo dynamic conformational shifts upon cyclin binding and phosphorylation (shawish2017molecularcloningand pages 1-8, shawish2017molecularcloningand pages 8-14, wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 3-3).\n\n6. Regulation  \nCDK3 regulation is principally achieved through its interaction with specific cyclin partners, most notably cyclin C (CCNC), which facilitates the structural rearrangements required for catalytic activity. The binding of cyclin C to CDK3 triggers conformational changes that expose the activation loop, allowing it to be phosphorylated—a step that is critical for transitioning CDK3 from an inactive to an active state. Furthermore, like other cyclin-dependent kinases, CDK3 is subjected to additional layers of regulation through post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. Key phosphorylation events on the activation loop, analogous to those observed in CDK2 (where phosphorylation of a threonine residue in the T-loop is crucial), are required for full enzymatic activation. Although detailed mapping of all phosphorylation sites on CDK3 is still forthcoming, available data indicate that its regulatory mechanisms align closely with classical CDK regulation, involving cyclin binding, phosphorylation by CDK-activating kinases (CAKs), and possible modulation by inhibitory proteins (shawish2017molecularcloningand pages 20-24, shawish2017molecularcloningand pages 24-25, kesavan2022chemicalbiologystrategies pages 229-231, kesavan2022chemicalbiologystrategies pages 87-91).\n\n7. Function  \nCDK3 plays a pivotal role in cell cycle control by regulating the critical transitions from a quiescent state (G0) into the G1 phase and subsequently from G1 to the S phase. It exerts its effects through the phosphorylation of key substrates that influence cell cycle progression. For instance, CDK3-mediated phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (RB1) is necessary for the release of E2F transcription factors, thereby promoting the progression from G0 into G1. Additionally, phosphorylation of activating transcription factor 1 (ATF1) by CDK3 enhances its transactivation capability, which in turn stimulates transcriptional programs that drive cell proliferation. Further substrates of CDK3, such as histone H1 and CABLES1, implicate it in the modulation of chromatin structure and additional cellular processes related to gene expression. In this capacity, CDK3 is critically involved in both cell cycle re-entry and the promotion of the G1-S transition, functions that are essential for normal cell proliferation and are frequently deregulated in oncogenic processes (shawish2017molecularcloningand pages 1-8, shawish2017molecularcloningand pages 20-24, kesavan2022chemicalbiologystrategies pages 229-231, shafiq2011molecularmodellingand pages 26-30).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nCDK3 has been associated with oncogenic processes based on its role in cell cycle progression and its ability to phosphorylate substrates that drive cell proliferation and transformation. Overexpression of CDK3 has been observed in several cancer cell lines, including those derived from breast cancer, where its aberrant activity may contribute to malignant transformation and uncontrolled cell growth. Although specific small-molecule inhibitors targeting CDK3 are less well characterized than those developed for other CDKs, there is significant interest in identifying and optimizing selective inhibitors as potential therapeutic agents for cancers marked by CDK dysregulation. Moreover, experimental approaches such as interaction profiling using split-luciferase assays have expanded the known repertoire of cyclin partners for CDK3, hinting at additional regulatory and non-canonical roles that may extend beyond cell cycle control. These findings underscore the importance of further functional and structural studies to fully elucidate the regulatory networks and potential clinical relevance of CDK3 (shawish2017molecularcloningand pages 14-20, shawish2017molecularcloningand pages 24-25, kesavan2022chemicalbiologystrategies pages 123-128, shafiq2011molecularmodellingand pages 185-190).\n\n9.

The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nCyclin‐dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) is a member of the cyclin‐dependent kinase family that falls within the CMGC group of serine/threonine kinases. It is evolutionarily restricted to metazoans and displays high conservation among vertebrate orthologs; its emergence is noted in the evolution of complex multicellular organisms, diverging from the more universal CDK1 homologs found in yeasts. CDK4, along with CDK6, forms a subfamily that is functionally specialized to mediate the G1 phase progression, and its conservation underscores its critical role in cell‐cycle regulation (doerig2005proteinkinasesas pages 7-8, harashima2013cellcyclecontrol pages 3-4).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nThe catalytic activity of CDK4 can be summarized by the reaction:  \nATP + [protein]–(L‐serine or L‐threonine) → ADP + [protein]–(L‐serine/threonine)‐phosphate + H⁺.  \nIn cells, CDK4 phosphorylates its substrates, such as members of the retinoblastoma (RB) protein family, to modulate signal transduction during the G1/S transition (chen2015bioinformaticsinprotein pages 2-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nCDK4 requires the presence of Mg²⁺ ions as a critical cofactor to facilitate ATP binding and phosphoryl transfer, a requirement that is common among protein kinases (chen2015bioinformaticsinprotein pages 2-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCDK4 preferentially phosphorylates serine/threonine residues within its substrates. Within the context of cyclin D–CDK4 complexes, its best‐characterized substrates are the retinoblastoma family proteins, such as RB1, whose phosphorylation results in the dissociation of the E2F transcription factors. Additional substrates include SMAD3, whose transcriptional activity is repressed upon phosphorylation by CDK4 in a cell‐cycle–dependent manner. Although a specific consensus substrate motif for CDK4 has not been exhaustively defined in the literature provided, its substrate recognition is tightly controlled by the assembly with cyclin D and by CDK inhibitors (doerig2005proteinkinasesas pages 7-8, harashima2013cellcyclecontrol pages 2-3).\n\n5. Structure  \nCDK4 exhibits the typical bilobal structure characteristic of protein kinases. The N-terminal lobe contains predominantly β-sheets and a conserved glycine-rich loop involved in ATP binding, while the C-terminal lobe is primarily α-helical and comprises the catalytic core that includes the activation loop and a conserved C-helix. The catalytic domain is flanked by less structured regions that are involved in interactions with cyclin D and CDK inhibitors such as p16^INK4a. Unique structural features of CDK4 include a distinct hinge region that influences inhibitor selectivity and a regulatory architecture that is modulated by cyclin binding, which in turn induces a conformational rearrangement essential for full catalytic activity (doerig2005proteinkinasesas pages 7-8, harashima2013cellcyclecontrol pages 4-5).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe activity of CDK4 is principally regulated by its association with D-type cyclins and by binding to CDK inhibitors, notably CDKN1B (p27^Kip1) and p16^INK4a. Assembly into the cyclin D–CDK4 complex is required for the kinase’s nuclear localization and subsequent enzymatic activity. Post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation events, further modulate its catalytic function during the cell cycle. For example, the phosphorylation of substrates such as RB1 and SMAD3 occurs in a tightly controlled, cell-cycle–dependent manner. The inhibitory interaction with CDK inhibitors blocks the ATP-binding site and prevents CDK4 activation, thereby serving as an essential mechanism to restrain cell-cycle progression (doerig2005proteinkinasesas pages 7-8, harashima2013cellcyclecontrol pages 6-8).\n\n7. Function  \nCDK4 plays an integral role in the regulation of cell-cycle progression through the G1 phase. By phosphorylating RB1, CDK4 induces the dissociation of the RB1/E2F complex, thereby facilitating the transcription of E2F target genes that drive the G1/S transition. In addition, CDK4 phosphorylates SMAD3 in a cell-cycle–dependent fashion, leading to the repression of its transcriptional activity. As a major integrator of mitogenic and antimitogenic signals, the cyclin D–CDK4 complex serves as a checkpoint regulator linking external growth signals to cell-cycle machinery (doerig2005proteinkinasesas pages 7-8, harashima2013cellcyclecontrol pages 2-3).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nCDK4 is an established target for cancer therapeutics, particularly in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer and other malignancies where its dysregulation contributes to uncontrolled proliferation. Inhibitors targeting CDK4/6, such as palbociclib, have been developed and are actively under clinical investigation in multiple trials (e.g., NCT06790693, NCT05969184, NCT06207734, NCT06558084, NCT05977036). These pharmacological agents act by inhibiting the kinase activity of CDK4, thereby restoring control over the cell cycle. Known disease associations also point to mutations and dysregulation of CDK4 as contributory factors in oncogenesis (NCT06790693, NCT05969184).\n\n9.

Regulates several neuronal development and physiological processes including neuronal survival, migration and differentiation, axonal and neurite growth, synaptogenesis, oligodendrocyte differentiation, synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission, by phosphorylating key proteins. Negatively regulates the CACNA1B/CAV2.2 -mediated Ca(2+) release probability at hippocampal neuronal soma and synaptic terminals (By similarity). Activated by interaction with CDK5R1 (p35) and CDK5R2 (p39), especially in postmitotic neurons, and promotes CDK5R1 (p35) expression in an autostimulation loop. Phosphorylates many downstream substrates such as Rho and Ras family small GTPases (e.g. PAK1, RAC1, RHOA, CDC42) or microtubule-binding proteins (e.g. MAPT/TAU, MAP2, MAP1B), and modulates actin dynamics to regulate neurite growth and/or spine morphogenesis. Also phosphorylates exocytosis associated proteins such as MCAM/MUC18, SEPT5, SYN1, and CDK16/PCTAIRE1 as well as endocytosis associated proteins such as DNM1, AMPH and SYNJ1 at synaptic terminals. In the mature central nervous system (CNS), regulates neurotransmitter movements by phosphorylating substrates associated with neurotransmitter release and synapse plasticity; synaptic vesicle exocytosis, vesicles fusion with the presynaptic membrane, and endocytosis. Promotes cell survival by activating anti-apoptotic proteins BCL2 and STAT3, and negatively regulating of JNK3/MAPK10 activity. Phosphorylation of p53/TP53 in response to genotoxic and oxidative stresses enhances its stabilization by preventing ubiquitin ligase-mediated proteasomal degradation, and induces transactivation of p53/TP53 target genes, thus regulating apoptosis. Phosphorylation of p35/CDK5R1 enhances its stabilization by preventing calpain-mediated proteolysis producing p25/CDK5R1 and avoiding ubiquitin ligase-mediated proteasomal degradation. During aberrant cell-cycle activity and DNA damage, p25/CDK5 activity elicits cell-cycle activity and double-strand DNA breaks that precedes neuronal death by deregulating HDAC1. DNA damage triggered phosphorylation of huntingtin/HTT in nuclei of neurons protects neurons against polyglutamine expansion as well as DNA damage mediated toxicity. Phosphorylation of PXN reduces its interaction with PTK2/FAK1 in matrix-cell focal adhesions (MCFA) during oligodendrocytes (OLs) differentiation. Negative regulator of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Activator of the GAIT (IFN-gamma-activated inhibitor of translation) pathway, which suppresses expression of a post-transcriptional regulon of proinflammatory genes in myeloid cells; phosphorylates the linker domain of glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS) in a IFN-gamma-dependent manner, the initial event in assembly of the GAIT complex. Phosphorylation of SH3GLB1 is required for autophagy induction in starved neurons. Phosphorylation of TONEBP/NFAT5 in response to osmotic stress mediates its rapid nuclear localization. MEF2 is inactivated by phosphorylation in nucleus in response to neurotoxin, thus leading to neuronal apoptosis. APEX1 AP-endodeoxyribonuclease is repressed by phosphorylation, resulting in accumulation of DNA damage and contributing to neuronal death. NOS3 phosphorylation down regulates NOS3-derived nitrite (NO) levels. SRC phosphorylation mediates its ubiquitin-dependent degradation and thus leads to cytoskeletal reorganization.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1.

Phylogeny  \nCyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), also known as PSSALRE, is classified within the cyclin-dependent kinase family but diverges markedly from classical cell cycle Cdks due to its unique regulatory activators and neuronal functions. CDK5 is highly conserved across mammalian species, with over 99% amino acid identity reported between human and bovine homologs, and its orthologs in higher eukaryotes share significant sequence similarity, whereas homologs identified in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans show lower identity percentages, indicating divergence in lower organisms (tang1996cyclindependentkinase5 pages 1-2). Phylogenetically, CDK5 groups with other Cdks that have evolved to execute specialized roles outside of cell cycle regulation; it has been traced back to an ancient eukaryotic kinase lineage that also gave rise to yeast Pho85, although CDK5 activation no longer depends on classical cyclins, reflecting its adaptation to neuronal contexts (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 6-7, tang1996cyclindependentkinase5 pages 1-2). Its evolution into a kinase that is activated by neuron-specific proteins such as p35 and p39 distinguishes it from other members of the family, which maintain cyclin-dependent activation mechanisms (łukasik2021cyclindependentkinases(cdk) pages 2-4, su2011cyclindependentkinasesin pages 1-3).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK5 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the hydroxyl group on the serine or threonine residues of substrate proteins. The chemical reaction can be summarized as follows: ATP + [protein]-(L-serine/L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺, which is the canonical phosphoryl transfer reaction found in serine/threonine kinases (bhounsule2017cyclindependentkinase pages 6-10).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of CDK5 relies on divalent cations, with Mg²⁺ serving as an essential cofactor that facilitates ATP binding and the proper orientation of the nucleotide for phosphoryl transfer. This requirement for Mg²⁺ is consistent with the cofactor dependency observed in other members of the CDK family (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 2-3).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCDK5 functions as a proline-directed serine/threonine kinase and exhibits a substrate specificity that centers on phosphorylating serine or threonine residues that are immediately followed by a proline. This substrate specificity is reflected in its ability to phosphorylate a variety of proteins containing such a consensus motif, which often is represented as S/T-P, and may include additional determinants dictated by the substrate’s surrounding amino acid context. For example, CDK5 preferentially phosphorylates proteins such as tau, MAP2, and various cytoskeletal proteins that bear these proline-directed motifs (su2011cyclindependentkinasesin pages 7-9, bhounsule2017cyclindependentkinase pages 43-52, kesavapany2004neuronalcyclindependentkinase pages 1-2). Subsequent substrate recognition studies indicate that additional residues flanking the core S/T-P motif may influence binding affinity and phosphorylation efficiency, thereby fine-tuning its activity on complex substrates involved in neuronal morphology and synaptic regulation (chou1999amodelof pages 1-3, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 3-5).\n\n5. Structure  \nCDK5 is composed of a conserved protein kinase domain that is common to all cyclin-dependent kinases, which includes a small N-terminal lobe composed predominantly of β-sheets and a larger C-terminal lobe largely consisting of α-helices. The active site, situated at the interface of these lobes, harbors an ATP-binding pocket and accommodates catalytic metals such as Mg²⁺. Unique regulatory features of CDK5 include an activation or T-loop region that contains key residues like Ser159; phosphorylation of this residue, as observed in studies, modulates kinase activity (sharma1999regulationofcyclindependent pages 1-2). Structural evidence further indicates that despite the high degree of conservation in the kinase fold, CDK5 lacks certain cyclin-binding elements present in classic cell cycle CDKs and instead interacts with non-cyclin activators such as p35 and p39, which induce the necessary conformational changes for catalytic activation (tang1996cyclindependentkinase5 pages 1-2, bhounsule2017cyclindependentkinase pages 1-6). The three-dimensional organization of CDK5 shows conservation of key catalytic motifs such as the glycine-rich loop (G-loop) and a C-helix that is repositioned upon activator binding. In addition, the hydrophobic spine, which is essential for aligning catalytic residues, is present in CDK5 and contributes to its unique substrate specificity and regulation (sharma1999regulationofcyclindependent pages 3-4, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 5-6).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of CDK5 occurs primarily through its association with neuron-specific activators, such as p35 and p39, which are necessary to induce a catalytically active conformation. Unlike classical Cdks that depend on multiple cyclins and phosphorylation by CDK-activating kinases, CDK5 is activated by binding to these specific activators, which also determine its subcellular localization and substrate specificity (kesavapany2004neuronalcyclindependentkinase pages 2-4, tang1996cyclindependentkinase5 pages 1-2). Post-translational modifications also play a critical role; phosphorylation of CDK5 at Ser159 is essential for its full catalytic activity, with casein kinase I (CKI) identified as a kinase capable of phosphorylating this residue in vitro, thereby enhancing its activity in complex with p25, a proteolytic product of p35 that is implicated in neurodegenerative processes (sharma1999regulationofcyclindependent pages 1-2, sharma1999regulationofcyclindependent pages 4-5). Furthermore, the cleavage of p35 to p25 by calpain not only increases the stability of the CDK5 complex but also redistributes its activity within neuronal cells, a process that has been closely associated with pathological hyperphosphorylation of substrates such as tau in Alzheimer’s disease (bhounsule2017cyclindependentkinase pages 19-23, su2011cyclindependentkinasesin pages 21-23). In addition to phosphorylation, other regulatory mechanisms include protein–protein interactions with substrates and anchoring proteins that facilitate spatially restricted kinase activity, thereby ensuring that CDK5 functions precisely within neuronal processes such as axonal guidance and synaptic vesicle cycling (kesavapany2004neuronalcyclindependentkinase pages 8-9, su2011cyclindependentkinasesin pages 23-24).\n\n7. Function  \nCDK5 plays a multifaceted role in the regulation of neuronal development, maintenance, and survival. It is predominantly expressed in post-mitotic neurons and is integral to processes such as neuronal migration, axonal and dendritic outgrowth, and synaptogenesis. CDK5 phosphorylates a wide array of substrates that mediate diverse neuronal functions, including the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics through modification of tau, MAP2, and MAP1B, which in turn influences microtubule stability and neurite growth (bhounsule2017cyclindependentkinase pages 6-10, su2011cyclindependentkinasesin pages 7-9). It also phosphorylates proteins involved in the synaptic vesicle cycle such as synapsin I, dynamin1, and amphiphysin, thereby modulating neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity (kesavapany2004neuronalcyclindependentkinase pages 5-6, rosales2006extraneuronalrolesof pages 5-7). Beyond these roles, CDK5 functions to promote neuronal survival by activating anti-apoptotic pathways that involve BCL2 and STAT3, while concurrently inhibiting pro-apoptotic signals such as JNK3/MAPK10 activity (bhounsule2017cyclindependentkinase pages 43-52, su2011cyclindependentkinasesin pages 20-21). In addition, CDK5 is implicated in the regulation of the circadian clock via phosphorylation of CLOCK protein, modulation of N-cadherin-mediated adhesion at synapses, and negative regulation of pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin signaling, thereby influencing both neuronal physiology and pathological states (bhounsule2017cyclindependentkinase pages 19-23, su2011cyclindependentkinasesin pages 23-24). CDK5 also plays roles outside the central nervous system, including modulation of endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis, as well as contributing to the regulation of proinflammatory pathways via the GAIT complex in myeloid cells (rosales2006extraneuronalrolesof pages 9-10, łukasik2021cyclindependentkinases(cdk) pages 30-31).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nExperimental inhibitors, such as roscovitine and related small molecules, have been used to target CDK5 activity in preclinical studies, with the aim of mitigating its aberrant activity observed in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (knockaert2002pharmacologicalinhibitorsof pages 5-6, su2011cyclindependentkinasesin pages 17-18). Disease associations are well documented, with hyperactivation of CDK5—particularly in the context of p25 accumulation—being linked to pathological tau hyperphosphorylation, double-strand DNA damage, deregulation of HDAC1, and subsequent neuronal cell death (bhounsule2017cyclindependentkinase pages 19-23, depinho2003decreasedcyclindependentkinase pages 9-10). Furthermore, mutations or dysregulation in CDK5 signaling components have been implicated in disrupted synaptic plasticity, cognitive dysfunction, and eventual neurodegeneration (su2011cyclindependentkinasesin pages 24-26, tang1996cyclindependentkinase5 pages 7-8). No specific disease-causing mutations in the CDK5 coding region are reported in the current context; however, modulation of its activity via altered expression or aberrant cleavage of its activator p35 to p25 constitutes one of the primary pathogenic mechanisms, making its regulatory network a focus for therapeutic intervention (bhounsule2017cyclindependentkinase pages 1-6, kesavapany2004neuronalcyclindependentkinase pages 1-2).\n\n9.

Phosphorylates pRB/RB1 and NPM1. Interacts with D-type G1 cyclins during interphase at G1 to form a pRB/RB1 kinase and controls the entrance into the cell cycle. Involved in initiation and maintenance of cell cycle exit during cell differentiation; prevents cell proliferation and negatively regulates cell differentiation, but is required for the proliferation of specific cell types (e.g. erythroid and hematopoietic cells). Essential for cell proliferation within the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles. Required during thymocyte development. Promotes the production of newborn neurons, probably by modulating G1 length. Promotes, at least in astrocytes, changes in patterns of gene expression, changes in the actin cytoskeleton including loss of stress fibers, and enhanced motility during cell differentiation. Prevents myeloid differentiation by interfering with RUNX1 and reducing its transcription transactivation activity, but promotes proliferation of normal myeloid progenitors. Delays senescence. Promotes the proliferation of beta-cells in pancreatic islets of Langerhans.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

CDK6 is phylogenetically related to other G1 phase kinases such as CDK4, and its origin can be traced back to the common eukaryotic ancestor along with other core CDKs involved in cell cycle regulation (colas2020cyclindependentkinasesand pages 1-2, pluta2024cyclin‐dependentkinasesmasters pages 23-25). Within the human kinome, CDK6 is classified in the cell cycle regulatory group and shares structural and functional characteristics with CDK4, yet it exhibits distinct tissue‐specific expression patterns and substrate specificities. Comparative genomic analyses have shown that CDK6 and its paralog CDK4 evolved by gene duplication in higher eukaryotes, and both kinases have maintained structural homology with the ancestral CDK proteins originally described in yeast (harper2001cyclindependentkinases pages 2-4, colas2020cyclindependentkinasesand pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK6 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to specific serine/threonine residues on target substrate proteins. The reaction can be summarized as follows:  \n  ATP + [protein] – (L‑serine or L‑threonine) → ADP + [protein] – (L‑serine/threonine‑phosphate) + H⁺  \nThis catalytic reaction is fundamental for modifying the activity and regulatory functions of key substrates such as retinoblastoma protein (pRB/RB1) and nucleophosmin (NPM1) (OpenTargets Search: -CDK6).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of CDK6 is dependent on the presence of Mg²⁺ ions, which function as essential cofactors by coordinating the phosphate groups of ATP during the catalytic reaction. Mg²⁺ is required for the proper binding of ATP to the conserved kinase domain, thereby facilitating efficient catalysis (knockaert2002pharmacologicalinhibitorsof pages 2-3).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCDK6 phosphorylates serine/threonine residues on target proteins that are crucial for cell cycle progression and differentiation. One of the primary substrates is the retinoblastoma protein (RB1), whose phosphorylation leads to conformational changes that release E2F transcription factors and promote the G1/S transition. In addition to pRB/RB1, CDK6 is known to phosphorylate nucleophosmin (NPM1) as well as additional substrates involved in differentiation and cytoskeletal reorganization (OpenTargets Search: -CDK6). Although a detailed consensus substrate motif for CDK6 is not explicitly defined in the available data, studies of the related G1 kinases suggest that substrate recognition by CDK6 is dependent upon the interaction with its D-type cyclin partners, which modulate the enzyme’s substrate binding groove and may impose preferences for specific amino acid sequences surrounding the phosphorylated residue (law2015cyclindependentkinaseinhibitors pages 2-3, pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 2-4).\n\n5. Structure  \nCDK6 possesses a canonical kinase domain that is characteristic of the serine/threonine protein kinases. The central kinase domain features a two-lobed structure: an N-terminal lobe, which is predominantly composed of β-sheets and includes the conserved PSTAIRE helix, and a larger C-terminal lobe composed largely of α-helices that contain the catalytic core and substrate-binding regions (endicott2013structuralcharacterizationof pages 1-2, wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 19-20). Key structural elements include the activation loop (T-loop), whose phosphorylation is necessary for achieving full catalytic activity, the glycine-rich loop that contributes to ATP binding, and the conserved DFG motif that coordinates Mg²⁺ and ATP (hallett2017structuralandfunctional pages 27-30, wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 19-20). Furthermore, binding of a D-type cyclin to CDK6 induces a conformational re-arrangement, particularly repositioning the C-helix from an “out” to an “in” conformation, which is crucial for aligning catalytic residues and substrate recognition. Unique to CDK6 in comparison with other family members, differences in the structure of its substrate-binding region and in its interactions with regulatory proteins (e.g., chaperones such as Hsp90/Cdc37) have been noted and contribute to its distinct functional profile (hallett2017structuralandfunctional pages 38-42, wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 7-8).\n\n6. Regulation  \nFull activation of CDK6 is dependent on its association with D-type cyclins (cyclin D1, D2, or D3), which under mitogenic stimuli bind to CDK6 during the G1 phase to form an active complex that phosphorylates downstream substrates. In addition, CDK6 activity is regulated post-translationally by phosphorylation events. Activation loop phosphorylation, typically mediated by CDK-activating kinases (CAK) such as CDK7 in complex with cyclin H and MAT1, is required to enhance the catalytic efficiency of CDK6 (hallett2017structuralandfunctional pages 20-24, law2015cyclindependentkinaseinhibitors pages 1-2). Conversely, CDK6 can be negatively regulated by inhibitory phosphorylation events mediated by kinases such as Wee1 and Myt1, although direct inhibitory phosphorylation events on CDK6 are less extensively characterized than those on other CDKs (suryadinata2010controlofcell pages 1-3). Moreover, CDK6 is subject to regulation by cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) from the INK4 family (e.g., p16INK4a) and the CIP/KIP family (e.g., p21CIP1, p27KIP1). Binding of these inhibitors can block the association of CDK6 with D-type cyclins or displace preformed active complexes, thereby preventing substrate phosphorylation and cell cycle progression (knockaert2002pharmacologicalinhibitorsof pages 3-4, schmitz2016cyclindependentkinasesas pages 1-2). Additionally, chaperone-mediated regulation involving Hsp90 and Cdc37 contributes to the proper folding and stabilization of CDK6 prior to cyclin binding, distinguishing its regulation from that of its close homolog CDK4 (wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 7-8, hallett2017structuralandfunctional pages 38-42).\n\n7. Function  \nCDK6 plays a critical role in the control of the cell cycle, particularly in governing the G1/S transition. By phosphorylating the retinoblastoma protein (pRB/RB1), CDK6 facilitates the release of E2F transcription factors, which in turn initiate the transcription of genes required for DNA synthesis and S phase entry (OpenTargets Search: -CDK6, suryadinata2010controlofcell pages 9-10). In addition to its quintessential role in cell cycle progression, CDK6 is involved in several aspects of cellular differentiation and proliferation. It is essential for the proliferation of specific cell types such as hematopoietic cells, thymocytes, and beta-cells in the pancreatic islets, and it is required for the production of newborn neurons in neurogenic regions such as the dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone (OpenTargets Search: -CDK6). CDK6 also contributes to the initiation and maintenance of cell cycle exit during differentiation in various tissues by modulating gene expression patterns and cytoskeletal organization. For example, in astrocytes, activation of CDK6 is associated with reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and enhanced cellular motility, while in myeloid cells, CDK6 can prevent differentiation by interfering with transcription factor RUNX1 (OpenTargets Search: -CDK6, pluta2024cyclin‐dependentkinasesmasters pages 45-46). Furthermore, CDK6 has been implicated in delaying senescence and modulating the transcription of genes that influence cell fate decisions during differentiation (hallett2017structuralandfunctional pages 223-226). Through its kinase-dependent and kinase-independent functions, CDK6 serves as an integrator of proliferative signals and differentiation cues, thereby playing a pivotal role in both normal physiology and oncogenesis (law2015cyclindependentkinaseinhibitors pages 2-3, hydbring2016noncanonicalfunctionsof pages 1-3).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nCDK6 is a well-established target for anticancer therapy, with several small-molecule inhibitors, such as palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib, currently approved for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer (law2015cyclindependentkinaseinhibitors pages 2-3, milletti2023cyclers’kinasesin pages 2-3). These inhibitors typically function by competing with ATP for binding to the conserved kinase domain of CDK6, thereby reducing the phosphorylation of key substrates like pRB and halting cell cycle progression. Dysregulation of CDK6, whether by overexpression, gene amplification, or loss of inhibitory signals such as those provided by p16INK4a, has been implicated in a variety of malignancies including hematological cancers, breast cancer, melanoma, and gliomas (OpenTargets Search: -CDK6, pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 53-54). Although specific mutation details in CDK6 itself are less frequently reported relative to alterations in its regulatory network, changes affecting its expression or interactions with cyclins and CKIs have significant impacts on cellular proliferation and differentiation outcomes (dallacqua2016cdk6controlsplatinum pages 13-16). In addition to its role in cell proliferation, CDK6 has been associated with non-canonical functions, such as the modulation of transcription factor activity and the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics during cell differentiation (OpenTargets Search: -CDK6, pluta2024cyclin‐dependentkinasesmasters pages 5-7). These multifaceted roles underscore CDK6’s significance as a master regulator of cell cycle progression and cellular differentiation, making it a prominent focus for further therapeutic intervention (schmitz2016cyclindependentkinasesas pages 5-7, wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 10-11).\n\n9.

Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are activated by the binding to a cyclin and mediate the progression through the cell cycle. Each different complex controls a specific transition between 2 subsequent phases in the cell cycle. Required for both activation and complex formation of CDK1/cyclin-B during G2-M transition, and for activation of CDK2/cyclins during G1-S transition (but not complex formation). CDK7 is the catalytic subunit of the CDK-activating kinase (CAK) complex. Phosphorylates SPT5/SUPT5H, SF1/NR5A1, POLR2A, p53/TP53, CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, CDK6 and CDK11B/CDK11. CAK activates the cyclin-associated kinases CDK1, CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6 by threonine phosphorylation, thus regulating cell cycle progression. CAK complexed to the core-TFIIH basal transcription factor activates RNA polymerase II by serine phosphorylation of the repetitive C-terminal domain (CTD) of its large subunit (POLR2A), allowing its escape from the promoter and elongation of the transcripts (PubMed:9852112). Phosphorylation of POLR2A in complex with DNA promotes transcription initiation by triggering dissociation from DNA. Its expression and activity are constant throughout the cell cycle. Upon DNA damage, triggers p53/TP53 activation by phosphorylation, but is inactivated in turn by p53/TP53; this feedback loop may lead to an arrest of the cell cycle and of the transcription, helping in cell recovery, or to apoptosis.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nCyclin‐dependent kinase 7 (CDK7), alternatively known as CAK1, MO15, or STK1, is a member of the cyclin‐dependent kinase (CDK) family that is evolutionarily conserved across eukaryotes. In metazoans, CDK7 functions as the principal CDK‐activating kinase (CAK) and is integrated into transcriptional control as well as cell cycle regulation. Orthologs of CDK7 have been identified from yeast to mammals, although yeast employs a distinct CAK (Cak1/Civ1) that is functionally divergent from the metazoan CDK7, underscoring an evolutionary separation in the regulation of transcriptional versus cell‐cycle CDKs (fisher2019cdk7akinase pages 1-3, liu2000evolutionofcyclindependent pages 1-2). CDK7 clusters phylogenetically with other transcription‐regulating CDKs within the CMGC kinase group, a clade that includes CDKs such as CDK8 and CDK9 that are predominantly involved in transcription. Its close association with components of the general transcription factor TFIIH as well as its role in activating cell cycle kinases situates it within a central evolutionary core of eukaryotic signaling pathways that emerged early in eukaryotic evolution (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 1-2, galbraith2019therapeutictargetingof pages 1-3). In light of these relationships, CDK7 is considered part of the core set of kinases that have been preserved from the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) and remain indispensable for both cell cycle progression and transcription regulation (fisher2019cdk7akinase pages 1-3).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK7 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine/threonine residues on its protein substrates. The general reaction can be written as:  \n  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺  \nThis phosphorylation reaction is central to its dual role in executing transcription initiation via the phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II and in activating other cyclin-dependent kinases through phosphorylation of a conserved threonine in their activation (T) loops (fisher2019cdk7akinase pages 1-3, lolli2005cak—cyclindependentactivatingkinase pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of CDK7 depends on the availability of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as the phosphate donor and requires divalent metal ions, typically magnesium (Mg²⁺), to facilitate the proper binding of ATP to its active site. This cofactor requirement is essential for the enzyme’s serine/threonine kinase activity, as Mg²⁺ coordinates with the phosphate groups of ATP to stabilize the transition state during the phosphoryl transfer reaction (gallorini2012cyclindependentkinasemodulators pages 3-5).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCDK7 exhibits a distinct substrate specificity that reflects its dual function as both a CDK-activating kinase (CAK) and a regulator of transcription. Regarding its role in cellular activation of other CDKs, CDK7 phosphorylates a conserved threonine residue in the activation loop of target kinases such as CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6, which is critical for their catalytic activity. In its transcriptional role, CDK7 phosphorylates the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (POLR2A) at serine residues—predominantly Ser5 and Ser7—within its heptad repeat sequence (Y₁S₂P₃T₄S₅P₆S₇). The consensus substrate motif for transcriptional phosphorylation does not entirely follow the classical proline-directed signature observed for many serine/threonine kinases but is defined by the repeated heptad structure unique to RNA polymerase II (galbraith2019therapeutictargetingof pages 6-7, fisher2019cdk7akinase pages 1-3). Additionally, CDK7 phosphorylates other substrates implicated in transcription and RNA processing such as the elongation factor SPT5, splicing factor SF1, and the tumor suppressor p53, thereby expanding its substrate repertoire beyond core CDKs and the RNA polymerase II CTD (fisher2019cdk7akinase pages 1-3, lolli2005cak—cyclindependentactivatingkinase pages 2-3).\n\n5. Structure  \nCDK7 possesses a canonical serine/threonine kinase fold composed of two lobes: an N-terminal lobe primarily composed of β-sheets and a larger C-terminal lobe that is predominantly α-helical. The interface between these lobes forms the ATP-binding cleft where catalysis occurs. A key structural feature is the PSTAIRE helix, common to many CDKs, which undergoes repositioning upon cyclin binding to facilitate substrate access. CDK7 forms a heterotrimeric complex with cyclin H and MAT1; this association is essential for its full catalytic activity and substrate specificity. The cyclin H subunit plays a critical role in inducing the required conformational changes in CDK7, while MAT1 serves as a scaffolding protein that stabilizes the CAK complex and facilitates its integration into the transcription factor TFIIH (fisher2019cdk7akinase pages 1-3, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 5-6). Moreover, the active site of CDK7 features a unique cysteine residue (Cys312) within its ATP-binding pocket that is exploited by covalent inhibitors such as THZ1, providing a structural basis for its selective inhibition (galbraith2019therapeutictargetingof pages 6-7, lolli2005cak—cyclindependentactivatingkinase pages 4-5). These structural attributes, including the activation loop, the hydrophobic spine, and the position of the C-helix, are critical for the regulation of its kinase activity and its interaction with substrates and regulatory proteins.\n\n6. Regulation  \nCDK7’s regulation is primarily achieved through post-translational modifications and its obligate association with cyclin H and MAT1. Phosphorylation of the T-loop (activation loop) of CDK7 is an essential modification that enhances its catalytic efficiency. Although CDK7 is often described as constitutively active during the cell cycle, its activity can be modulated by interaction with other proteins and by feedback mechanisms. For example, upon DNA damage, CDK7 phosphorylates p53, leading to the activation of cellular stress responses; in turn, activated p53 has been shown to inhibit CDK7 activity, establishing a regulatory feedback loop that can lead to cell cycle arrest and transcription inhibition (fisher2019cdk7akinase pages 1-3, lolli2005cak—cyclindependentactivatingkinase pages 2-3, malumbres2011physiologicalrelevanceof pages 4-6). Additionally, association with the general transcription factor TFIIH not only directs CDK7 substrate specificity towards the RNA polymerase II CTD but also contributes to its regulation through conformational constraints imposed by the multi-subunit complex (galbraith2019therapeutictargetingof pages 6-7, wohlbold2006thecyclindependentkinase pages 7-8). Inhibitory phosphorylation events and interactions with cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) further modulate CDK7’s activity, ensuring that its kinase functions are tightly coupled to cell cycle progression and transcriptional control.\n\n7. Function  \nCDK7 fulfills essential biological roles in both cell cycle progression and transcription. As the catalytic subunit of the CDK-activating kinase (CAK) complex, CDK7 phosphorylates and thereby activates several critical CDKs that govern transitions during the cell cycle. Notably, it activates the CDK1/cyclin B complex required for the G2–M transition and the CDK2/cyclin complexes that are pivotal for the G1–S transition. This activation is achieved via phosphorylation of a specific threonine residue in the T-loop of these kinases, which is necessary for their full catalytic activity (lolli2005cak—cyclindependentactivatingkinase pages 1-2, malumbres2005mammaliancyclindependentkinases pages 6-7).  \nIn its transcriptional role, CDK7 is a component of the transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) complex; it phosphorylates the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II at Ser5 and Ser7 within the conserved heptad repeats. This phosphorylation event is critical for promoter clearance, the recruitment of capping enzymes, and the transition from transcription initiation to productive elongation. Thus, CDK7 links the regulation of gene expression to the control of the cell cycle, coordinating the activation of transcription with cell proliferation signals (fisher2019cdk7akinase pages 1-3, galbraith2019therapeutictargetingof pages 6-7).  \nBeyond these roles, CDK7 phosphorylates several ancillary substrates, including the elongation factor SPT5, the splicing factor SF1, and the tumor suppressor p53. Phosphorylation of these proteins contributes to the regulation of mRNA processing, the DNA damage response, and cellular growth inhibition. These interactions underscore the centrality of CDK7 in integrating cell cycle cues with the complex network of transcription regulation, ensuring precise control over cell proliferation and genome stability (fisher2019cdk7akinase pages 1-3, lolli2005cak—cyclindependentactivatingkinase pages 2-3).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral small-molecule inhibitors have been developed that target CDK7 due to its pivotal role in oncogenic transcription and cell cycle control. Among these, covalent inhibitors such as THZ1 have shown selectivity by engaging a unique cysteine residue (Cys312) in the ATP-binding site of CDK7. These inhibitors have demonstrated potent anticancer activity in preclinical models by reducing RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription in cancer cells that exhibit transcriptional addiction. Furthermore, additional compounds such as SY-1365 have been advanced into clinical trials, emphasizing the therapeutic potential of targeting CDK7 (fisher2019cdk7akinase pages 7-8, galbraith2019therapeutictargetingof pages 6-7).  \nCDK7 is also associated with disease states; its overexpression or aberrant activity has been observed in various cancers, where it contributes to uncontrolled cell proliferation and deregulated transcription. In addition, since CDK7 phosphorylates p53 and other substrates involved in the DNA damage response, alterations in its regulation have implications for genome stability and apoptosis. The dual role of CDK7 in both activating cell cycle CDKs and promoting RNA polymerase II function has made it an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in cancer, where inhibitors may simultaneously disrupt critical cell cycle and transcriptional programs (malumbres2011physiologicalrelevanceof pages 4-6, wohlbold2006thecyclindependentkinase pages 7-8).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nCyclin‐dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) is a member of the cyclin‐dependent kinase family that has evolved to specialize in the regulation of transcription. Unlike the classical cell cycle CDKs (e.g., CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6) that exhibit cyclic expression and activity throughout the cell cycle, CDK9 is constitutively expressed and is found in all eukaryotic organisms, with functional orthologs in lower eukaryotes such as yeast (where Bur1 plays a similar role) and in higher vertebrates. CDK9 is grouped together with other transcriptional regulators (such as CDK7, CDK8, CDK12, and CDK13) based on its essential role in modulating RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) function. Its evolutionary conservation is demonstrated by the presence of the signature PITALRE motif, which has been maintained from yeast to human, indicating its fundamental impact on gene expression regulation (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 1-2, anshabo2021cdk9acomprehensive pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK9 catalyzes the phosphorylation reaction in which ATP is utilized as a phosphate donor. The reaction proceeds as follows:  \n  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺.  \nIn its cellular role, CDK9 phosphorylates the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB1/POLR2A) as well as additional substrates such as SUPT5H and RDBP. This reaction is critical for the transition from transcriptional pausing to productive elongation during mRNA synthesis (alrouji2025mechanisticrolesof pages 12-14, anshabo2021cdk9acomprehensive pages 2-4).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of CDK9 is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions, with Mg²⁺ serving as a required cofactor. Mg²⁺ coordinates the binding of ATP at the active site of the enzyme, thereby facilitating the transfer of the phosphate group during the catalytic reaction (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 9-10).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCDK9 exhibits a substrate preference that primarily targets serine residues within the heptapeptide repeats (Y₁S₂P₃T₄S₅P₆S₇) of the RNA polymerase II CTD. In particular, CDK9 is known to phosphorylate Ser2 residues, a modification that is pivotal for the release of RNA polymerase II from promoter-proximal pausing and the promotion of transcriptional elongation. In addition to the CTD of RNAPII, CDK9 phosphorylates other transcription-related substrates including the negative elongation factors DSIF and NELF, and factors such as EP300, MYOD1, and AR. The enzymatic activity reflects a consensus in which the target motif is defined by a serine (or threonine) residue within a context that is recognized by the active site of CDK9 (alrouji2025mechanisticrolesof pages 12-14, anshabo2021cdk9acomprehensive pages 16-17).\n\n5. Structure  \nCDK9 is characterized by a bilobal kinase domain that is typical of eukaryotic serine/threonine kinases. The small N-terminal lobe is composed primarily of β-sheets and includes a glycine-rich (G-) loop that helps to coordinate the phosphate groups of ATP. The larger C-terminal lobe is dominated by α-helices and contains the activation segment (T-loop), which undergoes conformational changes upon interaction with cyclin partners. A unique feature of CDK9 is the presence of the conserved PITALRE amino acid motif, which is critical for cyclin binding and the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Structural studies, including those based on crystallography of human cyclin K (used as a model to understand cyclin interaction) and homology models of CDK9 based on CDK2 structures, have helped to delineate these features. When CDK9 binds to its primary cyclin partner, cyclin T1, or alternatively cyclin K, the resulting conformational rearrangements stabilize the T-loop in an active configuration and facilitate substrate access to the ATP-binding site. Other structural features include the hydrophobic spine and the conserved C-helix, which are necessary for the proper orientation of catalytic residues (baek2007crystalstructureof pages 1-2, alrouji2025mechanisticrolesof pages 7-9, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 3-5, paparidis2017theemergingpicture pages 30-31).\n\n6. Regulation  \nCDK9 activity is tightly regulated through a combination of cyclin binding, post-translational modifications, and interactions with regulatory protein complexes. Binding to cyclin T1 (or cyclin K) is essential for CDK9’s activation as it leads to a conformational change that facilitates substrate binding and catalysis. Phosphorylation events also play a central role in regulating CDK9 activity; for instance, phosphorylation of the T-loop (typically at Thr186) by CDK-activating kinase (CDK7) is necessary for full activation. In addition to this activating phosphorylation, CDK9 is subject to regulatory inhibition through its sequestration in the 7SK small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (7SK snRNP) complex together with the inhibitory protein HEXIM1. This sequestration maintains a pool of inactive CDK9 that can be rapidly mobilized when transcriptional activation signals are received. Further, modifications such as acetylation and additional phosphorylation at sites such as Thr29, Ser90, and other residues have been reported to modulate the enzymatic activity. Viral proteins, notably HIV Tat, bind to P-TEFb and induce allosteric conformational changes that affect CDK9’s substrate binding and catalytic efficiency (alrouji2025mechanisticrolesof pages 5-7, krystof2012perspectiveofcyclindependent pages 6-7, anshabo2021cdk9acomprehensive pages 2-4, paparidis2017theemergingpicture pages 25-26).\n\n7. Function  \nCDK9 plays a critical role in the regulation of gene expression by mediating the transition of RNA polymerase II from a paused to an elongating state. As the catalytic core of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) complex, CDK9 phosphorylates the CTD of RNAPII at Ser2 residues, which facilitates transcript elongation and co-transcriptional processing events such as mRNA capping, splicing, and export. In addition to controlling basal transcription, CDK9 is involved in regulating inducible transcription networks. For example, it facilitates the promoter recognition of target transcription factors involved in cytokine signaling pathways, including TNF-inducible RELA/p65 and IL-6-inducible STAT3. CDK9 also phosphorylates other proteins, such as EP300, MYOD1, and the androgen receptor, thereby modulating their transcriptional activities in processes like muscle differentiation and cell growth. Beyond its established role in transcription, CDK9 is implicated in maintaining genome integrity by participating in the replication stress response and promoting recovery from replication arrest, as well as contributing to DNA repair through interactions with proteins like Ku70/XRCC6. The protein shows a ubiquitous expression pattern with elevated levels in certain cancer types, where its overactivation may lead to oncogenic transcriptional programs. This multifaceted role positions CDK9 as an important node in both cell growth control and stress signaling (alrouji2025mechanisticrolesof pages 12-14, alrouji2025mechanisticrolesof pages 20-21, anshabo2021cdk9acomprehensive pages 1-2, morales2016overviewofcdk9 pages 1-2).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral small-molecule inhibitors targeting CDK9 have been developed due to its critical role in transcription and oncogenesis. Experimental inhibitors such as SNS-032, flavopiridol, atuveciclib (BAY1143572), dinaciclib, and NVP-2 have shown the ability to induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in various cancer cell lines. Inhibition of CDK9 leads to downregulation of short-lived anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g., MCL-1) and oncogenes (e.g., MYC), thereby sensitizing cancer cells to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. CDK9 has also been implicated in viral pathogenesis, particularly in HIV replication, wherein the viral transactivator Tat recruits CDK9 to the viral promoter to stimulate transcription. Overexpression of CDK9 is associated with poor prognosis and therapy resistance in several cancers, including myeloma, breast, lung, and ovarian cancer. Thus, CDK9 not only plays a central role in transcriptional regulation but is also considered a promising target for therapeutic intervention in both oncology and antiviral therapies (alrouji2025mechanisticrolesof pages 12-14, galbraith2019therapeutictargetingof pages 1-3, falco2002cdk9frombasal pages 1-2).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nCyclin‐dependent kinase 10 (CDK10) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that belongs to the cyclin‐dependent kinase family and is classified within the Cdk10/Cdk11 subfamily. It is evolutionarily conserved among mammals and other vertebrates, and its emergence appears to have occurred after the divergence from yeast, as no clear orthologs exist in budding yeast. (duster2022functionalcharacterizationof pages 1-2)  \nCDK10 shares approximately 53% sequence identity over its catalytic region with its closest paralog CDK11, a finding that supports a common ancestral origin within the metazoan lineage. (guen2013cdk10cyclinmis pages 1-1)  \nPhylogenetic analyses based on the human kinome reveal that CDK10 is one of the later evolutionary additions, found only in higher eukaryotes, and it demonstrates significant conservation across species such as zebrafish, mouse, and human, indicating a vital role in vertebrate cellular regulation. (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 7-8)  \nThe identification of CDK10 orthologs in zebrafish and other vertebrates further confirms that it forms part of an evolutionarily conserved set of cyclin‐dependent kinases that regulate essential processes such as cell cycle progression and transcription, although its yeast counterparts are either absent or highly divergent. (yeh2013knockdownofcyclindependent pages 4-6)\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK10 catalyzes the transfer of the γ‐phosphate group from ATP to specific serine/threonine residues on substrate proteins, following the canonical reaction scheme:  \n  ATP + [protein]–(L‐serine or L‐threonine) → ADP + [protein]–(L‐serine/threonine)‐phosphate + H⁺. (duster2022functionalcharacterizationof pages 4-4)  \nThis phosphoryl transfer reaction is typical of serine/threonine kinases and results in a conformational change of the substrate, which may ultimately signal for its degradation or modulate its activity. (duster2022functionalcharacterizationof pages 4-5)\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of CDK10 depends on the presence of divalent metal ions, with Mg²⁺ being the primary cofactor required for effective ATP binding and the stabilization of the nucleotide within its active site. (sun2005homologymodelingand pages 4-5)  \nThe requirement for Mg²⁺ is critical, as it coordinates with the phosphate groups of ATP, thereby allowing the proper positioning of the substrate within the catalytic cleft for efficient phosphoryl transfer. (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 9-10)\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCDK10 exhibits substrate specificity for serine/threonine residues in a manner characteristic of cyclin‐dependent kinases, with a notable preference for phosphorylation events occurring in a proline-directed context. (duster2022functionalcharacterizationof pages 2-3)  \nOne of the best‐characterized substrates of CDK10 is the transcription factor ETS2; phosphorylation of ETS2 by CDK10 marks it for proteasomal degradation, thereby functioning as a regulatory mechanism to limit ETS2’s transcriptional activity. (guen2013cdk10cyclinmis pages 1-1)  \nIn addition to ETS2, CDK10 phosphorylates actin dynamics regulators such as protein kinase N2 (PKN2), and through this activity it modulates the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. (duster2022functionalcharacterizationof pages 15-16)  \nFurthermore, CDK10 appears to act on substrates that conform to a minimal consensus motif comprising a serine or threonine residue followed by a proline, although comprehensive consensus sequences have not yet been fully delineated. (guen2017theawakeningof pages 7-8)\n\n5. Structure  \nCDK10 is a protein of 360 amino acids featuring a central kinase domain that is highly conserved among cyclin‐dependent kinases. (duster2022functionalcharacterizationof pages 1-2)  \nWithin this domain, the catalytic center includes a critical aspartate residue (D163) that is essential for the phosphoryl transfer reaction, and the activation loop contains a conserved threonine residue (T196) whose phosphorylation is required for full catalytic activation. (duster2022functionalcharacterizationof pages 2-2)  \nA notable structural hallmark of CDK10 is the presence of a gatekeeper methionine at position 117, along with a variant of the classic CDK PSTAIRE motif—specifically, the PISSLRE motif—necessary for cyclin binding and proper positioning of the catalytic elements. (guen2017theawakeningof pages 1-2)  \nAlthough no experimental crystal structure of CDK10 is currently available, homology modeling studies using CDK2 as a template suggest that CDK10 adopts the canonical bilobal kinase fold. The N-terminal lobe is predominantly composed of beta sheets, whereas the C-terminal lobe is rich in alpha helices; this organization is critical for forming the ATP-binding cleft and for mediating substrate interactions. (sun2005homologymodelingand pages 1-2, sun2005homologymodelingand pages 2-4)  \nThe regulatory interaction with its cyclin partner, cyclin Q, is facilitated by conserved cyclin-binding motifs within CDK10, and this interface plays a major role in stabilizing the active conformation of the kinase. (guen2013cdk10cyclinmis pages 2-3)\n\n6. Regulation  \nCDK10’s enzymatic activity is tightly regulated by its association with cyclin Q, which is essential for both its activation and stability in the cellular environment. (duster2022functionalcharacterizationof pages 1-2)  \nA key regulatory mechanism involves the phosphorylation of the activation loop at threonine 196; this phosphorylation event is indispensable for achieving full catalytic activity, as mutations of this residue have been shown to abolish activity without disrupting the formation of the CDK10/cyclin Q complex. (duster2022functionalcharacterizationof pages 2-3)  \nAdditional post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at threonine 133 and serine 276, have been identified on CDK10; these modifications may affect the protein’s stability and its susceptibility to proteasomal degradation, although the precise enzymes responsible for these modifications have not been conclusively identified. (duster2022functionalcharacterizationof pages 8-9)  \nMoreover, CDK10 itself can be phosphorylated by other cyclin-dependent kinases including CDK1 and CDK5, with these phosphorylation events potentially contributing to cross-talk between different CDK-mediated signaling pathways. (guen2013cdk10cyclinmis pages 5-6)\n\n7. Function  \nCDK10 plays an important role in controlling cellular processes by phosphorylating specific protein substrates. A primary function of CDK10 is the phosphorylation of the transcription factor ETS2, which leads to its proteasomal degradation; this activity positions CDK10 as a negative regulator of ETS2-mediated transcription. (guen2013cdk10cyclinmis pages 1-1)  \nThrough its action on ETS2, CDK10 is implicated in the regulation of the MAPK signaling pathway, since degradation of ETS2 can affect the expression of downstream oncogenes, including c-Raf, thereby influencing cell proliferation and survival. (guen2013cdk10cyclinmis pages 2-3)  \nIn parallel, CDK10 phosphorylates actin regulatory proteins such as PKN2. This phosphorylation event is associated with the modulation of actin cytoskeleton organization and serves as a mechanism to negatively regulate ciliogenesis by promoting RhoA signaling. (duster2022functionalcharacterizationof pages 15-16)  \nExpression studies have revealed that CDK10 is broadly expressed in various tissues, and its activity has been linked to developmental processes—including aspects of neural development—and to the maintenance of cellular structural integrity. (yeh2013knockdownofcyclindependent pages 4-6)\n\n8. Other Comments  \nA number of small-molecule inhibitors have been explored for their capacity to inhibit CDK10 activity. For example, compounds such as flavopiridol, dinaciclib, SNS-032, and NVP-2 have been tested in biochemical assays, although these inhibitors tend to display higher potency against other cyclin-dependent kinases such as CDK9 and are not entirely selective for CDK10. (duster2022functionalcharacterizationof pages 4-5)  \nAdditionally, the inhibitor OTS964, which has been predominantly characterized as a CDK11 inhibitor, also exhibits moderate inhibitory activity against CDK10 in vitro; this observation has fueled interest in developing more selective inhibitors that target CDK10 specifically. (duster2022functionalcharacterizationof pages 5-6)  \nMutations and alterations in the expression levels of CDK10 or its cyclin partner, cyclin Q, have been linked to significant clinical phenotypes. In particular, loss-of-function mutations in cyclin Q have been associated with STAR syndrome, a developmental disorder characterized by syndactyly, telecanthus, and anogenital as well as renal malformations.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nCyclin‐dependent kinase 14 (CDK14), also known as PFTK1 or PFTAIRE‑1, belongs to the serine/threonine protein kinase family that is conserved across metazoans and is classified within the atypical PFTAIRE subgroup of cyclin-dependent kinases. Comparative genomic analyses have shown that CDK14 is present from invertebrates such as Drosophila to vertebrates, reflecting its appearance in eumetazoan evolution and its association with increased cellular complexity in organisms. CDK14 shares a catalytic core with classical cell cycle kinases; however, it is distinguished by the presence of the PFTAIRE motif—a variant of the canonical PSTAIRE sequence found in many CDKs—indicating an evolutionary divergence in the regulatory regions of these enzymes (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 29-32, malumbres2009cyclindependentkinasesa pages 1-2). Phylogenetic studies have grouped CDK14 together with other kinases such as CDK15, CDK16, CDK17, and CDK18 within the broader CMGC group, a clade typified by conserved catalytic elements and regulatory motifs including the activation loop and the flexible C-helix. The PFTAIRE subgroup’s evolutionary origin is inferred from sequence similarity and structural conservation seen in both the kinase domain and flanking regions, suggesting that CDK14 emerged as part of the diversification of the cell cycle regulatory apparatus during metazoan development (kamkar2015pftaire1(cyclindependent pages 49-53, mikolcevic2012orphankinasesturn pages 1-2). These evolutionary relationships also support the observation that CDK14 has acquired specialized functions such as roles in Wnt signaling and neuronal differentiation, which are not typically observed in the conventional cell cycle kinases.\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK14 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to protein substrates that contain serine or threonine residues. The general reaction proceeds as follows: ATP reacts with a target protein that possesses an un-phosphorylated serine or threonine residue, and after phosphotransfer the reaction yields adenosine diphosphate (ADP), the phosphorylated protein (with a phosphate group added to its serine or threonine residue), and a proton (H⁺). This reaction can be expressed in chemical terms as:  \n  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺  \nThis fundamental catalytic activity is shared by many serine/threonine kinases and underscores the role of CDK14 as an enzyme that regulates phosphorylation-dependent signaling events through modification of critical substrate proteins (malumbres2009cyclindependentkinasesa pages 1-2, ferguson2019discoveryofcovalent pages 1-3).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of CDK14, like that of most protein kinases, is strictly dependent on the binding of ATP as a phosphate donor. In addition, the catalytic process requires the assistance of divalent metal ions, most notably magnesium ions (Mg²⁺), which play an essential role in stabilizing the interaction between ATP and the enzyme’s active site. Magnesium ions facilitate the proper orientation of the ATP molecule within the catalytic cleft, thereby enabling efficient phosphoryl transfer to the substrate protein. This cofactor requirement is a well-established characteristic of cyclin-dependent kinases and is critical for their enzymatic function (malumbres2009cyclindependentkinasesa pages 1-2, ercan2021qualitativeandquantitative pages 21-24).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCDK14 displays substrate specificity that is characteristic of serine/threonine kinases involved in cell cycle and signal transduction regulation. One of the best characterized substrates of CDK14 is the Wnt signal transducing co-receptor, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6). During the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, CDK14 phosphorylates LRP6 specifically at serine 1490. This site-specific phosphorylation is critical for priming LRP6 for subsequent modifications that lead to the activation of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In vitro studies have also shown that CDK14 is capable of phosphorylating the retinoblastoma protein (RB1); however, while the phosphorylation of RB1 has been demonstrated in vitro, its physiological relevance in vivo remains to be confirmed. Although an unequivocal consensus phosphorylation motif for CDK14 has not been firmly established, it tends to target serine or threonine residues that are frequently followed by a proline residue—a common characteristic among many cyclin-dependent kinases. Furthermore, the substrate specificity of CDK14 is modulated by its interaction with cyclin partners such as cyclin Y, which can influence substrate docking and the local concentration of target motifs (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 32-35, alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 35-38, ferguson2019discoveryofcovalent pages 3-4, liu2010whycycliny? pages 3-4).\n\n5. Structure  \nCDK14 possesses a three-dimensional structure that conforms to the canonical architecture observed for cyclin-dependent kinases. The protein is organized around a central catalytic domain that exhibits a bilobal fold, wherein the N-terminal lobe is primarily composed of β-sheets and includes a glycine-rich (G) loop that is essential for ATP binding. The larger C-terminal lobe is predominantly α-helical and contains key catalytic residues, such as the catalytic aspartate, and the activation (T) loop which is pivotal for facilitating substrate phosphorylation. A defining structural feature of CDK14 is its PFTAIRE motif, a variant of the PSTAIRE sequence found in many classical CDKs; this motif is crucial for mediating the interaction with its cyclin partner, particularly cyclin Y, and plays an important role in the conformational changes required for full catalytic activation. In addition to the core kinase domain, CDK14 contains N-terminal and C-terminal extensions that, although less characterized structurally, are believed to contribute to regulatory interactions, stabilization of its active conformation, and determination of subcellular localization. Structural models derived from homology modeling and sequence alignment with other kinases suggest that CDK14 features an active site cleft formed at the interface of its two lobes, a flexible activation segment capable of undergoing significant conformational rearrangements upon cyclin binding, and a conserved C-helix that couples with the hydrophobic spine to maintain an active enzyme configuration. While no high-resolution crystal structure for CDK14 has been published to date, the combination of homology to well-characterized CDKs and computational structural predictions provides a reliable framework for understanding its three-dimensional organization and catalytic mechanism (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 29-32, kamkar2015pftaire1(cyclindependent pages 29-34, mikolcevic2012orphankinasesturn pages 3-4, kamkar2015pftaire1(cyclindependent pages 34-40).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulatory mechanisms governing CDK14 activity are multi-faceted and share similarities with those observed for other cyclin-dependent kinases. The primary mode of regulation is through the binding of a cyclin partner, and for CDK14 this role is fulfilled by cyclin Y. Association with cyclin Y triggers substantial conformational changes in CDK14, most notably by repositioning the T-loop away from the active site, thereby allowing for the proper binding of ATP and the subsequent access of substrate proteins. This cyclin-dependent activation is central not only to the catalytic function of CDK14 but also to its subcellular targeting; for instance, cyclin Y has been shown to facilitate the membrane localization of CDK14, an important consideration for its role in signaling pathways such as the Wnt cascade. In addition to cyclin binding, CDK14 regulation is influenced by phosphorylation events. Phosphorylation mediated by protein kinase A (PKA) has been reported to modulate the CDK14/cyclin Y interaction and alter subcellular distribution through the recruitment of 14-3-3 scaffold proteins. This regulation can include phosphorylation of the kinase itself, as well as phosphorylation of cyclin Y, which when phosphorylated may become recognized by ubiquitin ligases leading to its degradation. Such a feedback loop serves to fine-tune the activity level of the CDK14/cyclin Y complex in a cell cycle–dependent manner, particularly ensuring that kinase activity is appropriately coordinated during the G2/M transition. Overall, these regulatory mechanisms work in concert to control CDK14 activity both spatially and temporally, thereby ensuring a precise execution of its cellular roles (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 114-118, ferguson2019discoveryofcovalent pages 16-18, mikolcevic2012orphankinasesturn pages 1-2).\n\n7. Function  \nCDK14 functions as a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays diverse roles in cellular regulation by modulating crucial signaling pathways and cell cycle progression events. One of the central functions of CDK14 is its involvement in the regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway. During the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, CDK14 phosphorylates the Wnt co-receptor LRP6 at serine 1490, an event that is essential for priming LRP6 for further phosphorylation and for the subsequent stabilization of β-catenin. This phosphorylation cascade is instrumental in the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which in turn regulates gene transcription events that control cell proliferation and differentiation. In addition to its role in Wnt signaling, CDK14 has been implicated in the broader control of cell cycle progression through its interaction with cyclin D3 (CCDN3), indicating a potential role in driving cell cycle transitions. Furthermore, CDK14 is capable of phosphorylating the retinoblastoma protein (RB1) in vitro; however, the physiological importance of RB1 phosphorylation by CDK14 in vivo requires further clarification. Expression analyses have demonstrated that CDK14 is present in several tissues including brain and testis, supporting its suggested involvement in neuronal differentiation and meiosis. In certain cellular contexts, CDK14 may also act as a negative regulator of insulin-responsive glucose transport, thereby linking its kinase activity to aspects of cellular metabolism. Functional studies underscore that CDK14, through its modulation of key signaling pathways and regulatory substrates, is central to the orchestration of cell division, differentiation, and metabolic responses (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 16-26, alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 32-35, alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 38-41, alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 104-114, kamkar2015pftaire1(cyclindependent pages 49-53, mikolcevic2012orphankinasesturn pages 1-2).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nRecent chemical biology studies have advanced the development of specific inhibitors targeting CDK14, with a focus on covalent inhibition strategies. In particular, compounds such as FMF-04-159-2 have been designed to exploit a uniquely positioned reactive cysteine residue within the ATP-binding pocket of CDK14, thereby achieving pan-TAIRE family specificity. These covalent inhibitors serve as valuable tools for probing the biological functions of CDK14 and its contribution to signaling networks, and they underline the therapeutic potential of targeting CDK14 in pathological contexts. Aberrant expression and dysregulation of CDK14 have been associated with oncogenic processes in various cancers, including colorectal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, where altered CDK14 activity is thought to contribute to uncontrolled proliferation and tumor progression. In addition, there is emerging evidence suggesting that CDK14 may participate in the regulation of neuronal differentiation and in meiotic processes, thereby extending its potential impact to neurodevelopmental and reproductive biology. Furthermore, by modulating insulin-responsive glucose transport, CDK14 might also have implications in metabolic regulation, although the precise mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. The current generation of CDK14 inhibitors continues to be optimized for improved specificity and potency, and ongoing research efforts are directed towards understanding the full scope of CDK14’s biological impact and its utility as a therapeutic target (ferguson2019discoveryofcovalent pages 1-3, ferguson2019discoveryofcovalent pages 4-5, alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 41-44, gopinathan2011establishedandnovel pages 1-4).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nCyclin-dependent kinase 15 (CDK15), also known as PFTK2 or ALS2CR7, belongs to the serine/threonine-protein kinase family within the CMGC branch of the human kinome. It is classified in the PFTAIRE subfamily, a group of atypical or postmitotic CDKs that share a conserved kinase domain and a distinct PFTAIRE motif in place of the classical PSTAIRE sequence found in many mitotic CDKs (malumbres2009cyclindependentkinasesa pages 1-2, alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 29-32, wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 2-3). Orthologs of CDK15 are present in other mammalian species, consistent with the idea that its catalytic domain and regulatory features have been conserved since early eukaryotic evolution. Evolutionary studies position CDK15 alongside related kinases such as CDK14, CDK16, CDK17, and CDK18, which collectively form a distinct clade within the CDK family (malumbres2009cyclindependentkinasesa pages 1-2, kamkar2015pftaire1(cyclindependent pages 24-29).  \n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK15 catalyzes a phosphorylation reaction that transfers a phosphate group from ATP to a serine or threonine residue within substrate proteins. The generalized reaction is as follows: ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺. In the case of CDK15, one well-documented substrate is BIRC5 (Survivin), which is phosphorylated at threonine 34. This phosphorylation event contributes to the antiapoptotic function of CDK15 by counteracting apoptosis induced by TRAIL/TNFSF10 (ong2022ubiquitylationandphosphorylation pages 107-150).  \n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of CDK15 depends on the presence of divalent metal ions as cofactors. Consistent with other serine/threonine kinases, CDK15 requires Mg²⁺ for efficient ATP binding and phosphate transfer during the phosphorylation reaction (ong2022ubiquitylationandphosphorylation pages 107-150).  \n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nAs a serine/threonine-protein kinase, CDK15 is expected to phosphorylate substrates that present a serine or threonine residue followed by a proline residue, which is the minimal consensus motif (S/T-P) observed in many CDK substrates. Available data indicate that approximately 53% of CDK substrates contain phospho-SP or phospho-TP motifs, with some substrates additionally conforming to an extended motif such as (S/T)-P-X-(K/R) (errico2010identificationofsubstrates pages 15-16, amrhein2022discoveryof3amino1hpyrazolebased pages 1-3). Although direct substrate identification for CDK15 has been limited, its placement within the CDK family and the similarity of its catalytic domain to those of well‐characterized CDKs suggest that its substrate specificity aligns with these consensus sequences.  \n\n5. Structure  \nCDK15 contains a single, canonical kinase domain that spans amino acids 102 to 387 and is flanked by distinct N-terminal (residues 1–101) and C-terminal (residues 388–429) regions. The central kinase domain contains conserved catalytic motifs such as the DFG sequence, which is involved in Mg²⁺ coordination and ATP binding, and the HRD motif, which contributes to phosphate transfer. Furthermore, CDK15 exhibits a modified cyclin-binding motif known as PFTAIRE, setting it apart from classic CDKs that possess the PSTAIRE motif (ong2022ubiquitylationandphosphorylation pages 107-150, kamkar2015pftaire1(cyclindependent pages 29-34). A notable feature within the N-terminal segment is a canonical nuclear localization sequence (NLS) located between amino acids 67 and 73 (sequence KFKSKRP), which is critical for its nuclear import during interphase (ong2022ubiquitylationandphosphorylation pages 150-155). Although no experimentally resolved 3D structure specific to CDK15 currently exists, computational models and homology-based predictions suggest that its overall fold conforms to the conserved bilobal architecture characteristic of the CDK family. This organization includes an N-terminal lobe that typically harbors a glycine-rich loop and an αC-helix, and a larger C-terminal lobe that contains the activation loop and other elements essential for substrate binding and catalysis (wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 9-10, kamkar2015pftaire1(cyclindependent pages 29-34).  \n\n6. Regulation  \nThe activity of CDK15 is regulated via several mechanisms that are common among CDKs. Although full activation generally requires binding to a cyclin partner, the specific cyclin that associates with CDK15 has not been definitively identified. CDK15 interacts with several key mitotic regulators, including Mad2, Plk1, Aurora Kinase B, and Survivin, indicating that protein–protein interactions play a significant role in its regulatory network (ong2022ubiquitylationandphosphorylation pages 107-150). Binding to Plk1, for example, occurs through the kinase domain of Plk1 rather than its polo box domain, which suggests a specific regulatory interface distinct from that observed in other CDKs (ong2022ubiquitylationandphosphorylation pages 107-150). Additionally, nuclear localization is a regulated aspect of CDK15 function; the NLS between residues 67 and 73 ensures proper subcellular localization, likely influencing its access to substrates and regulatory proteins (ong2022ubiquitylationandphosphorylation pages 150-155). Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation events, are expected to be critical for modulating CDK15 activity. While activation loop phosphorylation and potential autophosphorylation events have been noted in other CDKs, detailed mapping of such regulatory sites on CDK15 remains to be elucidated (kamkar2015pftaire1(cyclindependent pages 29-34, ong2022ubiquitylationandphosphorylation pages 107-150).  \n\n7. Function  \nCDK15 serves as an antiapoptotic protein kinase that is involved in counteracting apoptosis induced by TRAIL/TNFSF10. It exerts this function by phosphorylating the inhibitor of apoptosis protein BIRC5 (Survivin) at threonine 34, thereby enhancing cell survival signals (ong2022ubiquitylationandphosphorylation pages 107-150, amrhein2022discoveryof3amino1hpyrazolebased pages 1-3). In addition to its antiapoptotic activity, CDK15 is implicated in the regulation of mitotic processes. It binds to several components of the spindle assembly checkpoint—such as Mad2—and associates with kinases like Plk1 and Aurora Kinase B, which are essential for proper chromosome segregation and cell cycle progression (ong2022ubiquitylationandphosphorylation pages 107-150, kamkar2015pftaire1(cyclindependent pages 24-29). Expression patterns for CDK15 indicate that it is present in neural tissues, including the brain and testis, reflecting a tissue distribution pattern common among members of the PFTAIRE subfamily (kamkar2015pftaire1(cyclindependent pages 49-53, alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 29-32). Furthermore, functional studies have linked aberrant CDK15 activity with oncogenic processes, particularly in colorectal cancer, where its kinase activity is associated with enhanced proliferation and poor patient prognosis (ong2022ubiquitylationandphosphorylation pages 107-150, amrhein2022discoveryof3amino1hpyrazolebased pages 1-3).  \n\n8. Other Comments  \nPreliminary investigations into pharmacological targeting reveal that CDK15 may be inhibited by compounds based on 3-aminopyrazole scaffolds, although these inhibitors are not yet selective for CDK15 over other CDKs of the PFTAIRE family (amrhein2022discoveryof3amino1hpyrazolebased pages 3-4). In addition, certain PARP inhibitors have exhibited activity against CDK15, suggesting cross-reactivity among kinase inhibitors that target the ATP-binding pocket (amrhein2022discoveryof3amino1hpyrazolebased pages 3-4). Genetic association data from large-scale initiatives such as the Open Targets Platform have identified a link between CDK15 and depressive disorder, supported by credible genome-wide association evidence; however, the mechanistic basis for this association is not fully detailed in the current literature (OpenTargets Search: -CDK15,PFTK2,ALS2CR7). No significant disease-causing mutations have been well characterized to date, and the kinase is primarily recognized for its role in modulating apoptosis and mitosis rather than for direct mutation-driven pathogenesis (malumbres2009cyclindependentkinasesa pages 1-2, ong2022ubiquitylationandphosphorylation pages 107-150).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nCyclin-dependent kinase 16 (CDK16), also known as PCTAIRE1 or PCTK1, is a member of the PCTAIRE subfamily within the larger cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) family. As part of the group that includes CDK14 through CDK18, CDK16 shares high sequence similarity in its conserved kinase domain with these atypical CDKs while displaying distinct regulatory features. The PCTAIRE subfamily is evolutionarily conserved across eumetazoans and is absent in simple unicellular models such as yeast, emphasizing its emergence later in evolution within multicellular organisms (amrhein2022discoveryof3amino1hpyrazolebased pages 1-3, mikolcevic2012orphankinasesturn pages 2-3). Phylogenetic analyses place CDK16 in close proximity to kinases such as CDK17 and CDK18, and its ancestral relationship is more closely tied to CDK5 than to classical cell cycle CDKs. This grouping is supported by the conservation of key catalytic motifs such as the HRD and DFG sequences along with a variant PCTAIRE motif in lieu of the canonical PSTAIRE motif found in many other CDKs (amrhein2022discoveryof3amino1hpyrazolebased pages 1-3, endicott2013structuralcharacterizationof pages 2-3). Orthologs of CDK16 have been detected in mammalian species, where its expression is particularly enriched in brain and testicular tissues, indicating a specialized role in post-mitotic as well as reproductive processes (mikolcevic2012orphankinasesturn pages 2-3, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 2-3).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK16 catalyzes the phosphorylation of serine/threonine residues on substrate proteins using ATP as a phosphate donor. The canonical reaction it performs can be summarized as:  \n  ATP + [protein]‑(L‑serine or L‑threonine) → ADP + [protein]‑(L‑serine/threonine)‑phosphate + H⁺  \nThis reaction is consistent with the activity profile for serine/threonine kinases within the CDK family, which generally facilitate regulatory phosphorylation events that modulate protein function (amrhein2022discoveryof3amino1hpyrazolebased pages 1-3, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 2-3).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe enzymatic activity of CDK16, as with most serine/threonine kinases, is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions. In particular, CDK16 requires Mg²⁺ as a cofactor for efficient ATP binding and catalysis. The coordinated binding of Mg²⁺ ions is essential to stabilize the ATP molecule in the catalytic cleft and to align the γ-phosphate for transfer to the target substrate (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 2-3, kamkar2015pftaire1(cyclindependent pages 29-34).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCDK16 phosphorylates specific serine/threonine residues on its substrates and exhibits a substrate specificity characteristic of many CDKs that prefer proline-directed motifs. For instance, CDK16 phosphorylates the N‑ethylmaleimide‑sensitive fusion protein (NSF) at a specific serine residue, thereby regulating NSF oligomerization involved in vesicle fusion processes (amrhein2022discoveryof3amino1hpyrazolebased pages 1-3, cole2009pctkproteinsthe pages 7-8). Moreover, in vitro studies have established that CDK16 is capable of phosphorylating cyclin Y (CCNY) at Ser‑336, further confirming its specificity toward serine residues in the context of a defined recognition motif (amrhein2022discoveryof3amino1hpyrazolebased pages 3-4). Although the complete consensus motif for CDK16 has not been determined to the extent of classical substrates for other CDKs, the observed activities on NSF and CCNY indicate that its substrate recognition likely involves a serine always immediately followed by a proline or flanked by basic residues, which is consistent with the substrate preferences reported for other CDK family members (hernandezortega2019phosphoregulationofthe pages 1-2, pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 4-6).\n\n5. Structure  \nThe structure of CDK16 is characterized by a central catalytic kinase domain that is typical of the CDK family, in addition to unique regulatory N‑ and C‑terminal extensions that confer its distinct functional properties. The kinase domain contains the highly conserved HRD and DFG motifs, which are critical for catalysis and binding of ATP, respectively. Notably, the PCTAIRE motif, a variant of the classical PSTAIRE helix, contributes to interactions with its regulatory cyclin partner, primarily cyclin Y (amrhein2022discoveryof3amino1hpyrazolebased pages 1-3, endicott2013structuralcharacterizationof pages 3-5). Structural analysis through crystallography and AlphaFold modeling indicates that CDK16 possesses a bi-lobal fold, with an N‑terminal lobe responsible for ATP binding—including the glycine-rich loop—and a larger C‑terminal lobe that accommodates substrate binding and catalytic activity. Unique to CDK16 is the partially inverted DFG motif and a distinctive C‑terminal extension which may provide additional protein–protein interaction surfaces that modulate its localization and regulation (karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 4-6, mikolcevic2012orphankinasesturn pages 4-6). The regulatory regions outside the kinase domain are thought to be intrinsically disordered and serve as platforms for post‑translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, that control kinase activity (endicott2013structuralcharacterizationof pages 8-9). These structural features, including the unique conformation of the activation loop and the regulatory PCTAIRE motif, underpin the selective interaction with cyclin Y, which is critical for achieving an active conformation (karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 2-4, kamkar2015pftaire1(cyclindependent pages 49-53).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of CDK16 occurs at multiple levels, incorporating both protein–protein interactions and post‑translational modifications. A key regulatory event is the binding of cyclin Y (CCNY), which is necessary for the activation of CDK16. Cyclin Y not only facilitates a conformational change in the kinase to promote substrate binding and catalysis but also localizes CDK16 to the plasma membrane through its N‑myristoylation signal (amrhein2022discoveryof3amino1hpyrazolebased pages 1-3, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 2-4). In addition, CDK16 is subject to regulation via phosphorylation. One critical phosphorylation site is serine 153 (Ser‑153), which lies in a consensus motif for protein kinase A (PKA); phosphorylation at this site has been shown to inhibit cyclin binding and subsequently reduce kinase activity (kamkar2015pftaire1(cyclindependent pages 49-53, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 13-14). Other phosphorylation events, potentially mediated by kinases such as Cdk5 or other regulatory enzymes, also modulate CDK16 activity by altering its conformation or protein–protein interaction capabilities (hernandezortega2019phosphoregulationofthe pages 15-16, mikolcevic2012orphankinasesturn pages 6-8). Moreover, interactions with adaptor proteins such as 14-3-3 have been reported, which may sequester CDK16 or affect its subcellular distribution without directly inhibiting its catalytic activity (cole2009pctkproteinsthe pages 8-10, mikolcevic2012orphankinasesturn pages 9-10). Collectively, these regulatory mechanisms ensure that CDK16 activity is tightly controlled in accordance with the cell’s physiological state, particularly in contexts such as vesicle trafficking and exocytosis in neurons, as well as during spermatogenesis (hernandezortega2019phosphoregulationofthe pages 5-7, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 14-15).\n\n7. Function  \nCDK16 plays several critical roles in cellular processes that span different physiological systems. In neuronal cells, CDK16 is involved in vesicle-mediated transport and the regulation of exocytosis. One of its specific functions is the phosphorylation of NSF (N‑ethylmaleimide‑sensitive fusion protein), a key mediator of vesicle fusion events, thereby modulating NSF oligomerization and affecting neurotransmitter as well as growth hormone release by brain neurons (amrhein2022discoveryof3amino1hpyrazolebased pages 1-3, cole2009pctkproteinsthe pages 7-8). In addition to its role in the central nervous system, CDK16 has been implicated in reproductive biology: it is required for normal spermatogenesis, with evidence derived from knockout models demonstrating impaired germ cell development when CDK16 function is compromised (mikolcevic2012orphankinasesturn pages 2-3, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 15-17). CDK16 may also participate in the regulation of insulin secretion in response to variations in blood glucose levels, suggesting an integration within metabolic control pathways (amrhein2022discoveryof3amino1hpyrazolebased pages 1-3). Furthermore, CDK16 is thought to contribute to neuronal differentiation and dendrite development, possibly by affecting cytoskeletal dynamics and vesicular transport processes (amrhein2022discoveryof3amino1hpyrazolebased pages 3-4, hernandezortega2019phosphoregulationofthe pages 1-2). An additional in vitro activity of CDK16 includes the phosphorylation of CCNY at Ser‑336, which may have regulatory implications for cyclin Y function and related signaling pathways (amrhein2022discoveryof3amino1hpyrazolebased pages 3-4). These functions collectively underscore the importance of CDK16 in both post‑mitotic neuronal activities and the regulation of specialized processes in reproductive and endocrine tissues (karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 17-17, shah2020cdksfamilya pages 4-5).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nRecent advances in chemical biology have led to the identification and development of small molecule inhibitors that target CDK16. Notably, a series of 3‑amino‑1H‑pyrazole based kinase inhibitors have been discovered that exhibit high potency and selectivity toward CDK16, with cellular effective concentrations in the nanomolar range (EC₅₀ = 33 nM) and demonstrated activity in cell viability assays accompanied by G2/M cell cycle arrest (amrhein2022discoveryof3amino1hpyrazolebased pages 1-3, amrhein2022discoveryof3amino1hpyrazolebased pages 3-4). These inhibitors not only validate the biological role of CDK16 but also serve as promising leads for therapeutic applications in contexts where CDK16 dysregulation is implicated. Disease associations have been reported for CDK16, as its aberrant activity has been linked to several types of cancer—including breast, prostate, cervical, melanoma, and non‑small cell lung cancer—as well as to neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (amrhein2022discoveryof3amino1hpyrazolebased pages 1-3, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 17-18). These associations, together with its roles in vesicular transport and hormone release, make CDK16 a compelling target for further drug discovery and pre‑clinical studies. In addition, the modulation of CDK16 activity through phosphorylation and cyclin interactions presents potential opportunities for the development of allosteric inhibitors or modulators that could fine‑tune its activity in a tissue‑specific manner (hernandezortega2019phosphoregulationofthe pages 15-16, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 14-15).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nCyclin‐dependent kinase 17 (CDK17), also commonly denoted as PCTAIRE2 or PCTK2, is an evolutionarily conserved member of the cyclin‐dependent kinase superfamily. This enzyme is classified within a distinct subgroup often referred to as the PCTAIRE or “atypical” CDKs. Unlike classical cell cycle kinases that possess the conventional PSTAIRE motif, CDK17 instead bears a unique PCTAIRE motif that serves as a hallmark of its subgroup. Comprehensive sequence analysis and multiple alignment studies demonstrate that the catalytic domain of CDK17 clusters with those of other PCTAIRE kinases – most notably with CDK16 (PCTAIRE1) and CDK18 (PCTAIRE3) – forming a well‐separated clade from the typical cell cycle regulators such as CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6 (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 114-118).  \nOrthologous sequences of CDK17 have been identified in a wide range of metazoan species. This evolutionary distribution is particularly evident in organisms that possess complex, differentiated nervous systems—a distribution that has led researchers to posit that the emergence of CDK17 was concurrent with the evolution of specialized, terminally differentiated cell types. Notably, studies have documented that the full-length kinase domain of CDK17 displays high conservation in critical regions such as the HRD and DFG motifs, which underscores its retained catalytic mechanism despite divergence in other regions of the primary sequence (mikolcevic2012orphankinasesturn pages 4-6).  \nIn addition, phylogenetic reconstructions have revealed that, despite some apparent functional parallels with CDK5 in neurons, CDK17 occupies an independent evolutionary branch. This branch is defined not solely by the presence of the unique PCTAIRE motif but also by distinct regulatory interactions and tissue-specific expression patterns. Investigations into invertebrate orthologs, including those reported in Drosophila, have further delineated the boundaries between canonical and atypical CDKs, thereby reinforcing the notion that the PCTAIRE subgroup represents a specialized evolutionary adaptation within the broader kinome (rascle2003l63thedrosophila pages 12-12).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK17 operates as a serine/threonine protein kinase. As with other enzymes of the cyclin-dependent kinase family, its catalytic activity is centered on the phosphoryl transfer reaction. In biochemical terms, CDK17 catalyzes the transfer of the gamma (γ) phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues present in its substrate proteins. This general reaction can be formally represented as follows:  \n  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺.  \nIn vitro assays have established that histone H1 is a prototypical substrate utilized to monitor the kinase activity of CDK17, and phosphorylation of histone H1 reliably reflects the ability of CDK17 to transfer phosphate groups onto protein substrates (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 29-32).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic function of CDK17, like that of many serine/threonine kinases, is dependent on the presence of specific divalent metal ions. In particular, magnesium ions (Mg²⁺) play an essential role as a cofactor by forming a coordination complex with ATP within the kinase active site. This complex formation is critical because the Mg²⁺ ion helps to stabilize the negative charges that emerge during the transition state of the phosphoryl transfer reaction, thus facilitating efficient catalysis. Without Mg²⁺, the correct positioning of ATP would be compromised, reducing the efficiency of phosphate transfer and thereby dampening the overall kinase activity (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 32-35).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nBiochemical characterization of CDK17 has revealed that it functions as a serine/threonine kinase, and histone H1 is frequently exploited as a model substrate in experimental studies designed to probe its enzymatic activity. Although a rigorous, fully defined consensus substrate motif for CDK17 has yet to be firmly established, experimental approaches such as positional scanning peptide library assays and in vitro kinase substrate screening have provided insights into its substrate preferences. The presence of the unique PCTAIRE motif appears to contribute notably to the selection of substrates by influencing the interactions between the catalytic cleft and the target phosphorylation site on substrates. In practice, the phosphorylation of histone H1 by CDK17 is employed as an experimental readout, supporting the inference that CDK17 specifically catalyzes the addition of phosphate groups to serine/threonine residues within substrates that present a compatible local sequence context (cole2009pctkproteinsthe pages 2-4, alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418a pages 29-32).  \nAlthough finer details regarding additional substrate recognition features remain to be elucidated, the consensus emerging from these studies is that CDK17 operates through a mechanism common to many serine/threonine kinases—namely, the carefully orchestrated binding of ATP and protein substrate through conserved active site architectures and flanking regulatory regions that contribute to substrate specificity.\n\n5. Structure  \nCDK17 is predicted to adopt the canonical bilobal structure that typifies the protein kinase superfamily. This structural arrangement comprises a relatively small N-terminal lobe that is primarily assembled from a series of β-strands and includes a key structural element known as the C-helix, as well as a larger C-terminal lobe that is predominantly helical. The interlobar cleft, situated between these two domains, forms the ATP-binding pocket and houses the catalytic machinery necessary for phosphoryl transfer.  \nWithin the catalytic core, CDK17 retains several conserved motifs that are integral to its function. Notably, the HRD motif acts as a critical catalytic residue involved in the proton shuttle during phosphoryl transfer, while the DFG motif is essential for coordinating the Mg²⁺ cofactor and properly positioning ATP for the reaction. Experimental and modeling studies of related kinases such as CDK16—whose crystal structures have been more extensively characterized—suggest that CDK17’s structure would exhibit substantial similarity regarding its overall fold, catalytic residues, and active site configuration (endicott2013structuralcharacterizationof pages 3-5).  \nA distinctive structural feature of CDK17 is the presence of the PCTAIRE motif within its cyclin-binding region. This element, which diverges from the classic PSTAIRE sequence found in many cell cycle’s CDKs, serves as a defining molecular signature of the PCTAIRE kinase subgroup. While a high-resolution three-dimensional structure of CDK17 has not yet been reported in the literature, homology models based on the experimentally determined structure of CDK16 imply that CDK17 retains the typical bilobal kinase architecture. In addition to the structured kinase domain, CDK17 is predicted to possess significant N-terminal and C-terminal sequence extensions. Although these regions display lower overall sequence conservation relative to the catalytic domain, they are thought to play roles in mediating protein–protein interactions, modulating subcellular localization, and possibly contributing to the regulation of kinase activity. Furthermore, by virtue of the extension regions, additional regulatory features such as docking sites for potential interaction partners and a context-dependent influence on substrate specificity may be present (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418e pages 32-35, endicott2013structuralcharacterizationof pages 3-5).  \nAdditional structural elements of interest within CDK17's catalytic core include the activation loop, a segment that in many kinases is subject to phosphorylation and undergoes conformational changes necessary for enzyme activation. In CDK17, the activation loop contains a serine residue in lieu of the conventional threonine found in several classical CDKs, a substitution that likely impacts the enzyme’s regulatory dynamics. Other critical components, such as the hydrophobic spine and the precise orientation of the αC-helix, are presumed to align closely with those observed in related kinases, collectively ensuring that the active conformation is achieved when regulatory conditions are met.\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of CDK17 centers around mechanisms that are common to many members of the cyclin-dependent kinase family while also incorporating features that are unique to the PCTAIRE subgroup. One of the primary modes of regulation is phosphorylation. In many CDKs, phosphorylation of a specific residue within the activation loop is essential for achieving full catalytic activity. In CDK17, a serine residue occupies the position at which classical cell cycle CDKs typically feature an activating threonine. Although detailed experimental studies specifically characterizing the phosphorylation dynamics of CDK17 are limited, the substitution of serine in this critical position is widely recognized as a central regulatory determinant that differentiates CDK17 from canonical kinases (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418b pages 29-32).  \nAnother regulatory mechanism involves the binding of a cyclin partner. In many members of the PCTAIRE family – such as CDK16 and CDK18 – cyclin Y has been identified as a critical activator that not only enhances kinase activity but also directs subcellular localization by conferring membrane-targeting properties. However, in the case of CDK17, the identity of the cyclin partner remains undefined. This absence of a clearly defined cyclin interaction has contributed to its designation as an “orphan” kinase in several studies. Despite the uncertainty over cyclin binding, cellular localization analyses have consistently demonstrated that CDK17 predominantly accumulates in the cytoplasm, with ancillary observations indicating mitochondrial association in specific cell models (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418d pages 29-32, karimbayli2022dissectingtheroleb pages 19-22).  \nIn addition to phosphorylation events and cyclin interactions, CDK17 is known to associate with regulatory proteins such as the Tudor Repeat Associator with PCTAIRE (Trap). Although Trap has been shown to bind CDK17, empirical evidence indicates that this interaction does not significantly modify the intrinsic kinase activity of CDK17 toward substrates like histone H1. Thus, while Trap may influence aspects of subcellular targeting or the broader assembly of signaling complexes, its binding does not equate to a direct modulation of catalytic output (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418b pages 29-32).  \nOverall, the regulation of CDK17 appears to be a composite process involving phosphorylation-dependent activation, potential yet unconfirmed cyclin-mediated engagement, and compartment-specific localization cues. These regulatory mechanisms collectively influence the ability of CDK17 to participate in cellular signaling, particularly within the context of terminally differentiated neuronal cells.\n\n7. Function  \nCDK17 is predominantly expressed in terminally differentiated, post-mitotic neurons where its selective expression markedly contrasts with that of the classical cyclin-dependent kinases active in proliferative cell types. In vitro kinase assays have demonstrated that CDK17 is capable of phosphorylating serine/threonine residues on protein substrates, with histone H1 serving as one of the canonical substrates used to monitor its activity. The phosphorylation of histone H1 by CDK17 is routinely employed as an experimental proxy for assessing its catalytic function, thereby establishing the enzyme’s role as a modulator of protein phosphorylation via reversible post-translational modification (cole2009pctkproteinsthe pages 2-4, alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418c pages 29-32).  \nBeyond its intrinsic kinase activity, the tissue-specific expression pattern of CDK17 implies a specialized biological role in neuronal physiology. High levels of CDK17 are observed predominantly in differentiated neuronal tissues, and multiple studies have correlated its expression with regions of the brain such as the hippocampus and olfactory bulbs. The evolutionary conservation of CDK17 in organisms possessing advanced neural architectures underscores the likelihood that CDK17 plays an essential role in sustaining the differentiated status and specialized functions of neurons (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 114-118, mikolcevic2012orphankinasesturn pages 4-6).  \nIn the domain of signal transduction, the catalytic activity of CDK17—specifically its ability to phosphorylate histone H1—suggests that it may be involved in the regulation of chromatin dynamics. Phosphorylation events mediated by CDK17 could influence chromatin organization and thereby modulate key processes such as transcriptional regulation or the maintenance of neuronal identity. Furthermore, its extended N-terminal and C-terminal regions, which are predicted to mediate distinct protein–protein interactions, may enable CDK17 to function as part of larger signaling complexes that integrate extracellular cues with intracellular responses in terminally differentiated neurons (rascle2003l63thedrosophila pages 12-12).  \nIn addition to chromatin regulation, CDK17’s activity in phosphorylating substrates on serine/threonine residues serves to modulate other cellular processes including, but not limited to, the regulation of cell survival pathways that are particularly relevant in post-mitotic cells. The specialized regulation and expression of CDK17 within the nervous system highlight its potential contribution to maintaining neuronal function and homeostasis, especially in the context of long-term neuronal survival and the management of stress responses.\n\n8. Other Comments  \nAs one of the less extensively characterized members of the cyclin‐dependent kinase family, CDK17 occupies a unique niche in that its precise cyclin dependency and full complement of endogenous substrates have yet to be comprehensively defined. Often referred to as an “orphan” kinase, CDK17’s lack of a definitively identified cyclin partner distinguishes it from other PCTAIRE kinases such as CDK16 and CDK18, for which cyclin Y and related activators have been more thoroughly characterized. Despite this, the conservation of essential catalytic motifs—including the HRD, DFG, and notably the signature PCTAIRE amino acid sequence—strongly supports the notion that CDK17 retains the fundamental biochemical properties of a serine/threonine kinase.  \nRecent experimental findings have also drawn attention to the potential involvement of CDK17 in neurodegenerative states. For instance, elevated expression levels of CDK17 and enhanced phosphorylation events have been documented in experimental models of Alzheimer’s disease, a phenomenon that is consistent with APP-driven phosphorylation pathways. These observations, documented in recent high-quality studies, further indicate that CDK17 may assume pivotal roles in the specialized regulatory networks that underlie neural homeostasis and, in pathological contexts, neuronal degeneration (karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 1-2).  \nFurthermore, current research endeavors are actively exploring the development of selective inhibitors that target kinases within the PCTAIRE subgroup, although the ambiguous cyclin dependency and incomplete delineation of CDK17’s regulatory network have posed challenges for the identification of highly specific inhibitory compounds. In this context, additional molecular characterization—including the elucidation of precise post-translational modifications, interaction partners, and downstream substrates—remains an important objective for ongoing studies (kamkar2015pftaire1(cyclindependent pages 49-53).  \nIn summary, while CDK17’s core catalytic function as an ATP-dependent serine/threonine protein kinase has been reasonably well established, its broader regulatory dynamics, substrate repertoire, and roles in neuronal function continue to be areas of active investigation. Ongoing research is expected to provide further insights into these aspects, potentially establishing CDK17 as a significant therapeutic target in neurodegenerative and other neurological disorders.\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nCyclin-dependent kinase 18 (CDK18), also known as PCTAIRE3 or PCTK3, is a member of the CDK family that falls within the atypical PCTAIRE subfamily. Unlike classical CDKs that harbor the highly conserved PSTAIRE sequence for cyclin binding, CDK18 contains a variant “PCTAIRE” motif. This subgroup also includes CDK16 (PCTK1) and CDK17 (PCTK2), and phylogenetic studies indicate that CDK18 and the other PCTAIRE kinases are evolutionarily conserved from simple invertebrates such as Caenorhabditis elegans to mammals, although CDK18 itself appears later in evolution compared to some other family members (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 29-32, pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 2-3). Phylogenetic analyses based on the human kinome reveal that CDK18 is most closely related to other kinases within the CDK5-related branch and is part of a core set that emerged early in eukaryotic evolution. Its evolutionary relationship with canonical CDKs is marked by conserved catalytic features, yet the divergence in its cyclin-binding motif underscores its distinct regulatory and functional evolution (pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 2-3, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK18 functions as a serine/threonine kinase that catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins. The biochemical reaction follows the general scheme: ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺. This phosphorylation event is an essential regulatory step in signal transduction cascades, affecting protein function, localization, and interaction (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 3-5).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nAs with most protein kinases, the catalytic activity of CDK18 depends on the presence of divalent metal ions, with Mg²⁺ being the primary cofactor required for proper ATP coordination and phosphotransfer activity. The Mg²⁺ ion functions to stabilize the negative charges on the phosphate groups of ATP, thereby facilitating the nucleophilic attack required for the phosphorylation reaction (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 3-5).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCDK18 phosphorylates serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. In vitro kinase assays have demonstrated that CDK18 is capable of phosphorylating the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) when activated by cyclin A2, though the phosphorylation efficiency is lower compared to canonical kinases such as CDK2 (matsuda2014pctairekinase3cyclindependent pages 1-2, matsuda2014pctairekinase3cyclindependent pages 10-11). Although a defined consensus substrate motif for CDK18 has not been conclusively established in the literature, experimental data suggest that the kinase, like other serine/threonine kinases, may recognize substrates in a sequence context that favors basic residues upstream of the phosphorylation site. In addition, the functional involvement of CDK18 in cellular processes such as replication stress response and actin cytoskeleton dynamics implies that its substrate repertoire might include proteins implicated in DNA damage checkpoint regulation (barone2016humancdk18promotes pages 1-1) as well as regulators of cytoskeletal organization (pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 9-11).\n\n5. Structure  \nCDK18 exhibits a domain organization characteristic of cyclin-dependent kinases with a central catalytic domain flanked by regulatory extensions. The catalytic kinase domain, approximately 250–300 amino acids in length, is comprised of a bilobal structure with an N-terminal lobe predominantly featuring β-sheets and a glycine-rich loop, and a larger C-terminal lobe enriched in α-helices. Within this conserved domain, key motifs are present, including a modified cyclin-binding αC-helix that contains the PCTAIRE motif instead of the canonical PSTAIRE sequence, a feature that distinguishes CDK18 from cell cycle CDKs (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 32-35, pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 2-3).  \nThe activation loop, which generally extends from a conserved DFG motif to an APE motif, is presumed to participate in regulating access to the catalytic cleft and substrate binding, similarly to other CDKs. Although no high-resolution crystal structure has been reported specifically for CDK18, comparative modeling based on the structure of closely related PCTAIRE kinases (such as CDK16) suggests that CDK18 maintains the overall kinase fold. Structural studies of related kinases have revealed a DFG-in conformation correlating with the active state, and it is anticipated that CDK18 exhibits a similar conformation upon activation via cyclin binding and post-translational modifications (endicott2013structuralcharacterizationof pages 2-3, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 2-4).  \nIn addition to its catalytic core, CDK18 contains unique N-terminal and C-terminal regions that are less conserved and implicated in mediating protein–protein interactions and subcellular localization. These extensions may contribute to the regulation of substrate specificity and the interaction with distinct cyclin partners, notably cyclin A2, which is essential for its kinase activity (pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 2-3, matsuda2014pctairekinase3cyclindependent pages 2-3). Furthermore, structural models indicate that CDK18 preserves characteristic catalytic residues, such as a conserved lysine in the ATP-binding pocket that is critical for catalytic activity, and an intact DFG motif for metal ion coordination (kamkar2015pftaire1(cyclindependent pages 29-34).\n\n6. Regulation  \nCDK18’s regulation is achieved through multiple mechanisms that include cyclin binding and phosphorylation by other kinases. A critical regulatory interaction is its binding to cyclin A2, which activates CDK18 by inducing conformational changes in the kinase domain that facilitate substrate access and full catalytic activity. In addition to cyclin A2 binding, CDK18 is also activated by phosphorylation mediated by protein kinase A (PKA). Phosphorylation at specific serine residues, most notably at Ser12, has been shown to significantly enhance the kinase activity of CDK18 even in the absence of cyclin binding; additional phosphorylation sites, such as Ser66 and Ser109, have been identified although their roles appear less pivotal for activation (matsuda2014pctairekinase3cyclindependent pages 10-11, matsuda2014pctairekinase3cyclindependent pages 12-13, pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 1-2).  \nMoreover, CDK18 has been reported to interact with 14-3-3 proteins upon its phosphorylation at one or more of these sites, which may modulate its subcellular localization and stability. Regulatory control of CDK18 also involves feedback mechanisms wherein its activation can influence the stability of cyclin A2, further integrating it into the cell cycle and signal transduction networks (matsuda2014pctairekinase3cyclindependent pages 13-14, pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 17-18). In addition, CDK18 plays a role in replication stress response pathways, wherein its activity is essential for the proper recruitment and retention of checkpoint proteins such as RAD9, RAD17, and TOPBP1 during ATR-mediated signaling (barone2016humancdk18promotes pages 1-1). This multifactorial regulation involving both protein–protein interactions and site-specific phosphorylation events distinguishes CDK18 from many of its classical cell cycle counterparts (pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 11-13).\n\n7. Function  \nCDK18 is predominantly expressed in terminally differentiated, post-mitotic cells, with a particularly high expression in neuronal tissues and oligodendrocytes. Its biological functions are linked primarily to signal transduction processes in these cells rather than to classical regulation of the cell cycle. Functionally, CDK18 has been implicated in the maintenance of genome integrity through its role in the replication stress response. In this capacity, CDK18 promotes the recruitment and phosphorylation of replication checkpoint mediators—such as RAD9, RAD17, and TOPBP1—thereby contributing to ATR activation and stabilization of stalled replication forks. This function is critical for preventing chromosomal abnormalities and the accumulation of DNA damage (barone2016humancdk18promotes pages 1-1, pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 7-9).  \nIn addition to its role in genome maintenance, CDK18 exerts influence on cytoskeletal dynamics. By regulating the phosphorylation status of actin-regulating proteins such as cofilin, CDK18 modulates actin polymerization, cell adhesion, and migration. For instance, reduced CDK18 activity has been associated with increased cofilin phosphorylation and consequent accumulation of filamentous actin at the cell periphery, which in turn affects cell motility and invasive behavior (matsuda2014pctairekinase3cyclindependent pages 13-14, pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 7-9).  \nFurther, CDK18 has been linked to the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells via activation of the ERK/MAPK signaling cascade. This role in neural cell differentiation, together with its involvement in the regulation of aquaporin-2 trafficking through interaction with ubiquitin ligase STUB1, suggests additional functions in cell differentiation and intracellular protein trafficking (pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 17-18, pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 19-20).  \nIn the context of oncogenic signaling, altered expression of CDK18 has been observed in several cancer types, including breast cancer and glioblastoma, where it contributes to replication stress signaling and influences responses to therapeutic agents such as PARP inhibitors (barone2016humancdk18promotes pages 1-2, pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 19-20). Collectively, these findings indicate that CDK18 functions as a multifaceted kinase involved in genome stability, cytoskeletal reorganization, and cell differentiation, particularly in specialized post-mitotic cell populations (pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 17-18).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nCurrently, no CDK18-specific inhibitors have been fully characterized; however, several compounds developed for related CDKs are under investigation for their potential activity against atypical kinases such as CDK18. Inhibitor studies conducted on related PCTAIRE kinases, including insights from inhibitor binding profiles in CDK16, suggest that CDK18 may exhibit a unique sensitivity profile with a limited spectrum of small-molecule engagement (karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 6-7, pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 4-6).  \nDisease associations for CDK18 include its implication in the modulation of replication stress and genome stability, which are critical processes in cancer biology. Overexpression of CDK18 and copy number gains have been reported in certain breast cancer subtypes, and its involvement in ATR-mediated signaling may contribute to therapy resistance in glioblastoma. In the nervous system, aberrant regulation of CDK18 has been linked to neurodegenerative conditions and altered neuronal functions, with its regulatory effect on tau phosphorylation suggested to play a role in Alzheimer’s disease neuropathology (barone2016humancdk18promotes pages 1-2, pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 13-14).  \nIn summary, while extensive structural and biochemical characterizations are available for several related PCTAIRE kinases, CDK18 remains less well studied. Its dual mode of activation—through cyclin binding and PKA-mediated phosphorylation—and its specialized functions in post-mitotic cells render it a promising target for further investigation in both cancer and neurological disorders (pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 14-16).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny – CDK20 is a member of the cyclin‐dependent kinase (CDK) family that is evolutionarily conserved across broad eukaryotic lineages. In phylogenetic analyses, CDK20, also known as CCRK, is grouped with the transcriptional CDKs rather than the classic cell‐cycle CDKs. Its orthologs have been identified in basal metazoans, choanoflagellates, and other early‐branching opisthokonts, indicating that the kinase emerged in the last common ancestor of animals and fungi (cao2014phylogeneticanalysisof pages 3-6). Despite its widespread conservation across metazoans, certain lineages such as some fungi (for example, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe) appear to have lost the ortholog of CDK20, underscoring its ancient origin and suggesting that its function was subsequently taken over by alternative regulatory pathways in these taxa (cao2014phylogeneticanalysisof pages 3-6). In the human kinome, CDK20 falls into the atypical or transcription-related subset of CDKs with further subdivision into groups that regulate transcription and gene expression rather than oscillatory cell-cycle progression. This classification is supported by kinase family studies that segregate CDKs into eight subfamilies, with CDK20/CCRK clustering alongside kinases such as CDK7, CDK8, CDK9, and CDK11 (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 1-2, lehtishiu2012diversityclassificationand pages 9-10). Additionally, evidence from studies discussing CDK family evolution consistently indicates that CDK20 shares significant sequence conservation in its kinase domain with other CDKs, including conservation of critical residues in the ATP-binding pocket and activation loop—a hallmark of the eukaryotic protein kinase superfamily that can be traced back to early eukaryotic evolution (shah2020cdksfamilya pages 4-5).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed – As a serine/threonine kinase, CDK20 catalyzes the phosphorylation reaction in which the γ-phosphate monoester from ATP is transferred to the hydroxyl group of a serine or threonine residue on target substrate proteins. In the case of its key substrate, CDK20 phosphorylates CDK2 at the threonine-160 residue present on its activation loop (T-loop), an event critically required for the full enzymatic activation of CDK2 and, by extension, the progression of the cell cycle (lai2020theroleof pages 5-7, tadesse2018cyclindependentkinase2 pages 8-12, cheng2006theroleof pages 1-2). In chemical notation, this reaction can be summarized as: ATP + [protein substrate]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein substrate]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺, which is characteristic of the reactions catalyzed by members of the CDK family (cheng2006theroleof pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements – The catalytic activity of CDK20 requires the presence of divalent cations, most notably magnesium ions (Mg²⁺), which function as essential cofactors by facilitating proper ATP binding and positioning in the kinase active site. This requirement for Mg²⁺ is consistent with the general mechanism observed in serine/threonine kinases, where magnesium stabilizes the negative charges of the ATP phosphates during the phosphoryl transfer reaction (cheng2006theroleof pages 6-6, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 2-3).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity – CDK20 exhibits substrate specificity that is consistent with that of classical CDKs. It preferentially phosphorylates serine/threonine residues that are positioned within a sequence context reminiscent of the CDK consensus motif. In particular, one well-documented substrate is CDK2, where CDK20 phosphorylates the threonine residue at position 160 located within its T-loop. This phosphorylation event is key to the activation of CDK2, and the local substrate context typically involves residues that facilitate proper recognition by the CDK catalytic domain, including a proline immediately following the phosphorylated residue—a feature common among many CDK substrates (chens2006theroleof pages 1-2, johnson2023anatlasof pages 21-23). Although the precise consensus sequence for CDK20 has not been as extensively characterized as for S6K or other CDKs detailed in kinase substrate atlases, the available data suggest that CDK20 follows the canonical CDK pattern involving recognition of a serine/threonine residue that is frequently flanked by proline and possibly additional basic residues that enhance binding affinity (johnson2023anatlasof pages 21-23).\n\n5. Structure – CDK20 possesses a conserved bilobal kinase domain typical of the CDK family. Its structure consists of an N-terminal lobe that primarily contains β-sheets, including a conserved glycine-rich loop that is involved in the proper coordination and binding of ATP, and a larger C-terminal lobe that is predominantly α-helical and contains the activation segment (or T-loop) critical for substrate recognition and catalysis (wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 3-4, ng2011glioblastomamultiformerole pages 2-4). Within the catalytic core, several key structural features are evident: an ATP-binding site formed by a hinge region between the lobes, a catalytic loop that includes conserved residues such as a Lysine that interacts with the phosphate groups of ATP, and an activation segment that must be correctly positioned—often through phosphorylation—to permit efficient substrate binding (shah2020cdksfamilya pages 4-5). Although no high-resolution crystal structure for CDK20/CCRK has been published to date, comparative modeling and sequence alignment with other well-defined CDKs (such as CDK2) suggest that it conforms to the canonical kinase fold. Furthermore, prediction models (for example, those generated by AlphaFold, as mentioned in discussions of ciliary kinases) support the notion that CDK20 exhibits the classical bilobal organization with a distinct catalytic cleft configured to accommodate both ATP and substrate peptides, thus ensuring the fidelity of its phosphoryl transfer reaction (ng2011glioblastomamultiformerole pages 2-4, flax2024illuminationofunderstudied pages 4-6).\n\n6. Regulation – Regulation of CDK20 occurs at multiple levels, including transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational mechanisms. Alternative splicing of the CDK20 gene leads to the production of several isoforms with distinct tissue distributions and functional properties. In mammalian systems, at least seven transcription variants have been reported. The generic isoform, which is ubiquitously expressed, plays a critical role as a cell cycle regulator by phosphorylating CDK2 at Thr-160 and thereby promoting cell proliferation. In contrast, a smaller variant predominantly expressed in cardiac tissue does not activate CDK2 but instead is involved in pro-survival signaling pathways, for instance by modulating ERK signaling (lai2020theroleof pages 5-7). In addition to these isoform-specific effects, CDK20 is also subject to regulation by upstream transcription factors. In hepatocellular carcinoma cells, for example, the androgen receptor (AR) directly binds to an androgen-responsive element in the CDK20 promoter region, leading to increased transcription and expression of CDK20. This transcriptional regulation by AR has been linked to the activation of downstream oncogenic pathways via phosphorylation of substrates such as EZH2 (pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 14-15). CDK20’s activation itself relies on formation of complexes with cyclin partners—though the precise cyclin partner for CDK20 remains less well defined compared to other CDKs—and on phosphorylation events that may enhance its catalytic conformation. Notably, while CDK20 has been reported to function as a CDK-activating kinase (CAK) for CDK2, some studies have indicated that it lacks intrinsic CAK activity in certain cellular contexts, implying that its activation may be regulated by additional co-factors or by protein–protein interactions that help stabilize its active conformation (lehtishiu2012diversityclassificationand pages 9-10, shah2020cdksfamilya pages 4-5).\n\n7. Function – CDK20 plays multiple roles in both developmental and proliferative contexts. One of its key functions is to ensure high-level Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) responses in the developing neural tube. Through coordinated actions with TBC1D32, CDK20 contributes to the proper assembly of the primary cilium by controlling the organization of both the ciliary membrane and the axoneme, a function critical for the accurate activation of GLI2 transcription factors in response to Shh signaling. This role in ciliogenesis is particularly important because the primary cilium functions as a signaling hub, and defects in ciliary assembly are closely associated with developmental disorders and ciliopathies (information provided in the protein information section). In parallel, CDK20 is involved in the regulation of cell growth. By phosphorylating CDK2 at Thr-160, CDK20 activates CDK2, thereby enabling progression through key checkpoints of the cell cycle. This activation of CDK2 is critical for the G1/S phase transition and contributes to the promotion of cellular proliferation. These dual roles in both ciliary function and cell cycle regulation underscore the importance of CDK20 in a wide range of biological processes—from neural development to oncogenesis—and highlight its potential as a target in cancer where aberrant cell proliferation and ciliary dysfunction may coexist (lai2020theroleof pages 5-7, ng2011glioblastomamultiformerole pages 2-4, oskomic2025keap1nrf2interactionin pages 14-15).\n\n8. Other Comments – Although specific inhibitors for CDK20/CCRK have not been described with the same level of detail as other kinases, functional studies have implicated CDK20 in various oncogenic processes, including glioblastoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. In these contexts, overexpression of CDK20 correlates with increased cell cycle progression, tumor growth, and resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy mediated via activation of downstream effectors such as β-catenin and EZH2. In addition, the evolving data on isoform-specific functions—particularly the divergence between the generic, proliferation‐promoting isoform and the cardiac variant involved in cell survival—underscore the complexity of its biological regulation. The emerging structural models, including those derived from AlphaFold predictions and comparative modeling, are expected to expedite drug discovery efforts targeting CDK20, although highly potent and selective inhibitors remain to be developed. Disease associations extend beyond cancer; given its role in primary cilium assembly, mutations or dysregulation of CDK20 may also be linked to ciliopathies or developmental defects in the neural tube. Notably, the kinase is required for high-level Shh signaling—a pathway critical for neural development—thus implicating CDK20 in congenital conditions associated with impaired ciliary signaling (oskomic2025keap1nrf2interactionin pages 14-15, flax2024illuminationofunderstudied pages 4-6).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nFructosamine‐3‐kinase (FN3K, Uniprot Q9H479) is an evolutionarily conserved protein kinase present in a broad spectrum of eukaryotic organisms including mammals, birds, amphibians, fishes, and nematodes, while it is notably absent in yeasts, arthropods, and Drosophila (beeraka2021thetamingof pages 12-14). Gene duplication events in tetrapods have given rise to two paralogous isoforms – FN3K and the FN3K‐related protein (FN3K‐RP) – which share approximately 65% sequence identity and a similar genomic organization (conner2005somecluesas pages 1-3, beeraka2021thetamingof pages 12-14). Phylogenetic analyses suggest that FN3K shares distant sequence homology with microbial aminoglycoside kinases and belongs to a group of kinases that include protein kinase–like (PKL) enzymes, a family that emerged early in the evolution of eukaryotes (beeraka2021thetamingof pages 14-15, delpierre2003fructosamine3kinasean pages 1-2). These observations place FN3K within an evolutionary core of protein kinases responsible for metabolic and stress‐related protein repair functions (kannan2024illuminatingthefunctions pages 1-4).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nFN3K catalyzes the phosphorylation of protein‐bound fructosamines derived from non‐enzymatic glycation of lysine residues. Specifically, the reaction involves the transfer of the gamma phosphate from ATP to the 3-hydroxyl group of the fructose moiety attached to lysine, yielding ADP and fructosamine‑3‑phosphate, which is intrinsically unstable and decomposes spontaneously to generate 3-deoxyglucosone, inorganic phosphate, and the regenerated unmodified lysine (beisswenger2001humanfructosamine3kinasepurification pages 1-2, beeraka2021thetamingof pages 26-28).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of FN3K is dependent upon ATP as the phosphate donor, and the reaction requires the presence of divalent metal ions, typically Mg²⁺, to coordinate nucleotide binding and facilitate phosphoryl transfer (tsai2006anewinhibitor pages 6-7, krause2006aconvenienthplc pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nFN3K exhibits high substrate specificity for glycated lysine residues (fructoselysine) present on proteins and demonstrates considerably higher affinity for these protein-bound fructosamines compared to free monosaccharides such as fructose (beeraka2021thetamingof pages 26-28, delpierrre2004identificationoffructosamine pages 2-3). In addition, FN3K also phosphorylates other ketoamine substrates such as psicosamines and ribulosamines, with FN3K‐RP being more selective toward these substrates (beeraka2021thetamingof pages 14-15, collard2004fructosamine3kinaserelatedprotein pages 1-2). The enzyme’s substrate recognition relies on the specific orientation of the sugar hydroxyl groups and the presence of a fructosamine moiety on lysine, characteristics essential for efficient phosphorylation (szwergold2011thephysiologicalsubstrates pages 1-2).\n\n5. Structure  \nFN3K is a monomeric enzyme composed of 309 amino acids with an approximate molecular weight of 35 kDa (beisswenger2001humanfructosamine3kinasepurification pages 4-6). The enzyme exhibits a protein kinase–like (PKL) fold that is characterized by an N-terminal lobe responsible for ATP binding and a C-terminal lobe that constitutes the substrate-binding region (garg2025themolecularbasis pages 1-2). A unique structural feature of FN3K is its redox-sensitive ATP-binding P-loop that contains conserved cysteine residues, notably Cys32, which mediate disulfide-bond formation and influence dimerization and enzymatic activity (beeraka2021thetamingof pages 12-14, shrestha2020aredoxactiveswitch pages 1-1). Furthermore, crystallographic studies reveal key catalytic residues—including Lys41, Glu55, Asp244, Asp217, and Trp219—that coordinate nucleotide binding, substrate positioning, and phosphoryl transfer (garg2025themolecularbasis pages 3-4, garg2025themolecularbasis pages 12-13). The overall 3D structure maintains a canonical kinase fold with the positioning of a dynamic activation loop and a C-helix that is critical for productive catalysis (garg2025themolecularbasis pages 8-10).\n\n6. Regulation  \nFN3K activity is regulated through redox-dependent mechanisms mediated by cysteine residues located within the P-loop, which undergo disulfide bond formation under oxidizing conditions to modulate enzyme oligomerization and activity (shrestha2020aredoxactiveswitch pages 1-2, beeraka2021thetamingof pages 14-15). In addition, the enzyme’s activity is influenced by competitive inhibition by synthetic substrate analogs such as 1-deoxy-1-morpholinofructose (DMF), which bind to the active site and impede phosphorylation of natural fructosamines (tsai2006anewinhibitor pages 6-7, krause2006aconvenienthplc pages 1-2). Post-translational modifications that might further affect FN3K activity have been investigated; however, its regulation appears to be predominantly governed by intrinsic redox changes rather than extensive phosphorylation events (shrestha2020aredoxactiveswitch pages 1-1).\n\n7. Function  \nFN3K plays a critical biological role in intracellular protein repair by mediating the deglycation of proteins via phosphorylation of fructoselysine adducts, thereby reversing non-enzymatic glycation (beisswenger2001humanfructosamine3kinasepurification pages 1-2, beeraka2021thetamingof pages 26-28). This enzymatic deglycation prevents the accumulation of Amadori products and subsequent formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which are implicated in diabetic complications and age-related tissue damage (motshwari2018theeffectof pages 36-40, delpierre2003fructosamine3kinasean pages 1-2). FN3K is highly expressed in erythrocytes, liver, heart, brain, and kidneys, where glycation stress is pronounced due to high glucose levels and long-lived proteins (beeraka2021thetamingof pages 12-14, conner2005somecluesas pages 8-13). In addition, FN3K has been implicated in the maintenance of cellular redox balance through its role in the deglycation and subsequent activation of the transcription factor NRF2, which is central to the oxidative stress response and cancer progression (beeraka2021thetamingof pages 14-15, garg2025themolecularbasis pages 8-10). The enzyme’s housekeeping expression profile is consistent with its fundamental role in the repair and maintenance of protein function under glyco-oxidative stress conditions (conner2005somecluesas pages 1-3).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral competitive inhibitors have been developed to target FN3K; among these, substrate analogs such as DMF have been shown to effectively reduce FN3K activity and thereby increase the accumulation of glycated proteins (tsai2006anewinhibitor pages 6-7, krause2006aconvenienthplc pages 1-2). Disease associations of FN3K include its potential impact on the progression of diabetic complications due to its role in mitigating protein glycation, as well as its involvement in modulating NRF2 activity in certain cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma (beeraka2021thetamingof pages 14-15, motshwari2018theeffectof pages 36-40). Genetic variability in FN3K activity, influenced by polymorphisms in the FN3K gene, has been linked to differences in glycation levels (avemaria2015possibleroleof pages 1-2, delpierre2006variabilityinerythrocyte pages 2-3). No definitive clinical inhibitors have yet been approved, and research continues to explore FN3K as a therapeutic target for reducing glycation-mediated tissue damage.\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nSerine/threonine‐protein kinase DCLK1 (also known as DCAMKL1, DCDC3A, or KIAA0369) is a member of the calcium/calmodulin‐dependent kinase (CAMK) clade within the broader eukaryotic serine/threonine kinome. DCLK1 orthologs are found across metazoans and are particularly well conserved in vertebrates, where alternative splicing generates isoforms with distinct regulatory C-terminal tail regions. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that DCLK1, together with DCLK2 and DCLK3, emerged from an ancestral kinase gene early in metazoan evolution, and the vertebrate DCLK1 isoforms evolved distinct structural features, including tandem N‐terminal doublecortin (DCX) domains and a variable C-terminal regulatory tail, which are absent or significantly shorter in invertebrate homologs (venkat2023mechanisticandevolutionary pages 2-4, venkat2023mechanisticandevolutionary pages 4-5).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nDCLK1 catalyzes the phosphorylation of serine/threonine residues on substrate proteins by transferring the γ‐phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the hydroxyl group of the target amino acid. The chemical reaction can be summarized as follows: ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (chen2023molecularmechanismof pages 3-5, johnson2023anatlasof pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of DCLK1 requires the presence of divalent metal ions, particularly Mg²⁺, which serve as a cofactor necessary for proper ATP binding and phosphoryl transfer during catalysis (patel2016biochemicalandstructural pages 5-6).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nAs a serine/threonine kinase, DCLK1 phosphorylates target proteins on serine or threonine residues. Although detailed consensus motifs for DCLK1 have not been fully established in isolation, its substrate specificity is generally consistent with that of other CAMK family members. Published kinome substrate profiling has revealed that many kinases of this class preferentially recognize specific sequence contexts flanking the phosphoacceptor site. In the case of DCLK1, phosphorylation has been demonstrated on peptide substrates derived from proteins involved in microtubule regulation, with the requirement for local amino acid configurations that facilitate access to the catalytic cleft. Accordingly, substrates are expected to contain a serine or threonine residue surrounded by residues that contribute to an optimal binding orientation in the catalytic pocket (chen2023molecularmechanismof pages 3-5, johnson2023anatlasof pages 7-7).\n\n5. Structure  \nDCLK1 possesses a multidomain architecture that underlies its dual functionality in kinase signaling and microtubule regulation. The N-terminal region contains tandem doublecortin (DCX) domains that mediate microtubule binding and are critical for neuronal migration during brain development (patel2016biochemicalandstructural pages 1-3). Interposed between these domains and the kinase domain is a PEST linker, a sequence rich in proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine residues that is prone to proteolytic processing and may modulate the connectivity between microtubule-binding and catalytic functions. The C-terminal region harbors a serine/threonine kinase domain that adopts a bilobal structure characteristic of protein kinases, including a conserved ATP-binding lobe (N-terminal) and a substrate-binding lobe (C-terminal). Within this kinase domain, key structural features such as the activation loop, the DFG motif (including the aspartate crucial for magnesium coordination), the catalytic HRD motif, and the C-helix are present and arranged in a conformation that can be autoinhibited. In some isoforms, an autoinhibitory domain (AID) resides in the region adjacent to the kinase domain; it acts as a pseudo-substrate by occupying the ATP-binding pocket and hindering substrate access. This interaction is mediated via defined helices (termed R2 and R3 in structural studies) and involves conserved residues, including salt-bridge formation (e.g., between K692 and residues D511 and D533) that are critical for catalytic regulation (chen2023molecularmechanismof pages 1-3, patel2016biochemicalandstructural pages 3-4, venkat2023mechanisticandevolutionary pages 12-14).\n\n6. Regulation  \nDCLK1 is subject to multiple regulatory mechanisms that modulate its kinase activity. A prominent mode of regulation is autoinhibition mediated by a built-in autoinhibitory domain (AID) that binds to and occludes the ATP-binding site, thereby preventing phosphorylation activity. Post-translational modifications, especially phosphorylation at specific serine and threonine residues within the kinase domain and the C-terminal tail, further modulate the activity of DCLK1. For instance, autophosphorylation events within the activation loop are critical for switching DCLK1 from an inactive to an active state. Additionally, mutations found in cancer, such as S660L, P675L, G681E, and A686T, disrupt the interaction between the AID and the kinase domain, releasing autoinhibition and resulting in increased kinase activity (chen2023molecularmechanismof pages 3-5, venkat2023mechanisticandevolutionary pages 15-17). The conformational dynamics of the C-terminal tail, including its docking into the ATP-binding pocket (mimicking ATP binding through residues such as Val682, Val684, and Thr687), further regulate autoinhibition. Phosphorylation of residues in this region, notably Thr688 in certain isoforms, stabilizes the autoinhibited conformation by forming hydrogen bonds with elements of the glycine-rich loop (venkat2023mechanisticandevolutionary pages 12-14, venkat2023mechanisticandevolutionary pages 17-18).\n\n7. Function  \nDCLK1 is implicated in the regulation of several fundamental cellular processes, particularly within the nervous system. It is involved in calcium-dependent signaling pathways that control neuronal migration during brain development, a process mediated in part through its microtubule-binding DCX domains. In mature neurons, DCLK1 is thought to participate in the modulation of microtubule dynamics, which is essential for maintaining neuronal structure and function. Beyond its roles in normal neurodevelopment, aberrant expression and activation of DCLK1 have been associated with oncogenic processes. Elevated DCLK1 kinase activity has been linked to increased tumor cell proliferation, invasiveness, and metastasis in various cancers, including colorectal and pancreatic cancers. Expression levels and autoinhibition mechanisms appear to differ between isoforms, with some variants predominantly expressed during embryogenesis and others in the adult brain, suggesting isoform-specific roles in developmental and pathological contexts (chen2023molecularmechanismof pages 1-3, patel2016biochemicalandstructural pages 1-3, venkat2023mechanisticandevolutionary pages 2-4).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral small-molecule inhibitors have been identified that target the kinase domain of DCLK1 by binding to key residues within the ATP-binding site, such as D533. Compounds like NVP-TAE684 and inhibitors identified through screening efforts have shown promising binding affinities, with some newer candidates demonstrating dissociation constants in the low micromolar range based on complementary in silico docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and surface plasmon resonance assays (chen2023molecularmechanismof pages 10-13, chen2023molecularmechanismof pages 13-15). Disease associations for DCLK1 are notably linked to its overexpression in tumors, where mutations that disrupt autoinhibition can contribute to tumorigenesis. In experimental models, upregulated DCLK1 activity correlates with markers of cancer stem cells and increased tumor cell invasiveness, underscoring the potential of DCLK1 as a therapeutic target in oncology. In addition, its established role in neuronal migration and microtubule regulation highlights its importance in nervous system development and function (chen2023molecularmechanismof pages 17-17, venkat2023mechanisticandevolutionary pages 1-2).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nDCLK2, also known as DCAMKL2, DCDC3B, DCK2, or CaMK-like CREB regulatory kinase 2, belongs to the doublecortin-like kinase family within the broader CaMK group of serine/threonine kinases. It shares significant sequence and domain homology with other members of the family, including DCLK1 and doublecortin (DCX), and exhibits approximately 68% amino acid identity with DCLK1, placing it among evolutionarily conserved kinases that emerged early in the metazoan lineage (hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 3-5, ohmae2006molecularidentificationand pages 4-5). Comparative phylogenetic analyses based on kinase domain conservation indicate that DCLK2 co-evolved with other CaMK-like kinases and is classified within a subgroup that distinguishes itself by a markedly reduced Ca²⁺/calmodulin affinity compared to classical CaMKs (venkat2023mechanisticandevolutionary pages 17-18). Its evolutionary conservation is supported by the presence of one-to-one orthologs across several vertebrate species, consistent with the core kinase families identified in early eukaryotic evolution (venkat2023mechanisticandevolutionary pages 4-5).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nDCLK2 catalyzes the transfer of phosphate from ATP to serine or threonine residues on target proteins. The chemical reaction can be summarized as: ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 1-3).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of DCLK2 is dependent on divalent cations, with magnesium (Mg²⁺) being required as a cofactor, as is typical for serine/threonine protein kinases (hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 3-5).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nDCLK2 phosphorylates serine/threonine residues within protein substrates; in the context of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), it directly phosphorylates TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) on Ser172, which is essential for TBK1 activation (hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 10-11). Although a defined consensus motif for DCLK2 has not been fully elucidated, its substrate recognition appears to be isoform specific, as evidenced by distinct catalytic activities observed between isoforms such as DCLK2203 and DCLK2201 (hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 10-11). Data from the wider serine/threonine kinase family suggest that substrate specificity may reflect preferences for amino acid residues proximal to the targeted serine or threonine, yet current reports on DCLK2 emphasize its role in phosphorylating TBK1 and, by similarity, possibly the CREB coactivator CRTC2/TORC2 (hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 1-3, song2021thexlinkedintellectual pages 19-25).\n\n5. Structure  \nDCLK2 is characterized by an N-terminal region that contains tandem doublecortin (DCX) domains responsible for microtubule binding and stabilization, followed by a C-terminal serine/threonine kinase domain. The DCX domains confer binding to microtubules, which is a hallmark of the DCX family of proteins, while the kinase domain exhibits conserved motifs typical of CaMK family kinases, including a glycine-rich loop, a catalytic lysine residue, and an activation loop (hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 3-5, ohmae2006molecularidentificationand pages 4-5). Structural analyses and AlphaFold-derived models predict that the kinase domain of DCLK2 adopts an active-like conformation; key catalytic residues such as Lys423 are critical for activity, as mutation to a kinase-dead form (K423A) abrogates its ability to phosphorylate substrates such as TBK1 (hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 10-11). A notable structural feature of DCLK2 is its isoform-specific regulatory variation; the predominant ccRCC isoform, DCLK2203, lacks an autoinhibitory C-terminal threonine (T693) that is present in other isoforms, thereby exhibiting increased kinase activity (hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 10-11).\n\n6. Regulation  \nDCLK2 is regulated at multiple levels. Isoform-specific alternative splicing generates variants with differing catalytic capacities, as exemplified by DCLK2203, which is endowed with enhanced kinase activity due to the absence of an autoinhibitory C-terminal threonine residue present in DCLK2201 (hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 10-11). In addition, the expression levels of DCLK2 are modulated by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway; downregulation of UPF1 in ccRCC correlates with elevated expression of DCLK2203 (hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 10-11). Moreover, the catalytic activity of DCLK2 is essential for the phosphorylation of TBK1, and kinase-dead mutants fail to rescue cellular growth phenotypes associated with endogenous DCLK2 depletion, indicating strict catalytic dependence (hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 10-11). Prior studies also suggest that regulatory mechanisms common to the CaMK family, such as phosphorylation and possible conformational autoinhibition by C-terminal domains, may be applicable to DCLK2, albeit with a significantly reduced dependence on Ca²⁺/calmodulin (hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 3-5, venkat2023mechanisticandevolutionary pages 17-18).\n\n7. Function  \nDCLK2 functions as a serine/threonine kinase with key roles in oncogenic signaling, particularly in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). It phosphorylates TBK1 on Ser172, an event that activates TBK1 and subsequently triggers downstream signaling pathways including the phosphorylation of p62 at Ser366, thereby promoting tumorigenesis (hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 10-11, hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 1-3). Expression of the predominant DCLK2203 isoform is observed in ccRCC, and functional assays demonstrate that depletion of DCLK2 impairs anchorage-independent growth and tumor formation in kidney cancer models (hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 1-3, hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 10-11). By similarity to other members of the DCX superfamily, DCLK2 may also participate in microtubule regulation; however, its documented oncogenic function appears primarily linked to the activation of TBK1 rather than classical microtubule modulation (hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 3-5, ohmae2006molecularidentificationand pages 4-5).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nExperimental inhibitors such as DCLK1-IN-1, originally developed for DCLK1, have exhibited inhibitory activity against DCLK2 as well, with reported IC50 values in the low to submicromolar range in kinases assays, although the potency against DCLK2 tends to be lower than for DCLK1 (ferguson2020discoveryofa pages 3-4, ferguson2020discoveryofa pages 4-5). Disease associations for DCLK2 have been identified in the context of ccRCC, with the DCLK2203 isoform being implicated in promoting oncogenic signaling through TBK1 activation; similar expression patterns in multiple cancer types suggest a broader oncogenic role (hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 10-11, song2021thexlinkedintellectual pages 19-25). Notably, the significantly reduced Ca²⁺/calmodulin affinity of DCLK2 distinguishes it from other CaMK family members and adds to its unique regulatory and functional profile. Kinase-dead mutants such as K423A have been shown to abolish catalytic activity and fail to rescue tumorigenic phenotypes, confirming the necessity of its kinase function in cellular contexts (hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 10-11).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nBRSK1, also known as SAD-B, is a brain‐selective serine/threonine kinase that belongs to the AMPK‐related kinase family within the CAMK group of the human kinome. Orthologs of BRSK1 have been identified in various species including mouse, Caenorhabditis elegans (where the ortholog is SAD-1), Drosophila, and ascidians, demonstrating its evolutionary conservation across eukaryotes (asiain2012regulaciónyfunción pages 82-89, lyn2011theregulationof pages 65-70). BRSK1 is phylogenetically closely related to its paralog BRSK2, and both kinases share significant sequence conservation within their catalytic domains with other AMPK-related proteins (bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 2-3, asiain2012regulaciónyfuncióna pages 82-89).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nThe catalytic reaction mediated by BRSK1 involves the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to serine or threonine residues on target substrate proteins. In its reaction, ATP and a protein with a free hydroxyl group are converted to ADP and a phosphorylated protein, releasing a proton in the process (template reaction description; see also aguirre2014lkb1ampktsc2signalingpathway pages 56-60).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of BRSK1 depends on the presence of divalent cations, with Mg²⁺ being required as a cofactor to facilitate the transfer of the phosphate group from ATP to the substrate (bright2008investigatingtheregulation pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nBRSK1 phosphorylates a variety of substrates that are critical for neuronal polarity and cell cycle regulation. Its substrates include CDC25B, CDC25C, microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT/TAU), RIMS1, gamma-tubulin isoforms (TUBG1 and TUBG2), and WEE1. The phosphorylation events occur on serine/threonine residues within target proteins. Although a specific consensus substrate motif is not explicitly defined in the available data, the list of substrates implies that BRSK1 recognizes and phosphorylates specific sequences within proteins that control neuronal polarization and centrosome duplication (banerjee2013phosphorylationubiquitylationanda pages 35-39, tamir2019identificationandcharacterization pages 109-113).\n\n5. Structure  \nBRSK1 is organized into several distinct domains. It contains an N-terminal serine/threonine kinase domain responsible for catalytic activity, which includes critical regulatory elements such as the activation loop (T-loop), where phosphorylation at a conserved threonine residue (Thr-189) is essential for activation by upstream kinases like LKB1 (asiain2012regulaciónyfunción pages 82-89, bright2008investigatingtheregulation pages 7-8). Adjacent to the kinase domain is a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain, which is thought to contribute to structural stabilization and possibly to regulate the conformational state of the kinase. Further downstream, BRSK1 possesses regulatory regions that may include proline-rich sequences and a kinase-associated (KA1) domain along with an autoinhibitory sequence (AIS) at the C-terminus; these domains have been described in the context of the broader AMPK-related protein family (tamir2019identificationandcharacterization pages 109-113). Unique structural features of BRSK1 also include redox-sensitive cysteine residues in the kinase domain that mediate reversible oxidative modifications, thereby serving as redox sensors that modulate kinase activity (bendzunas2024redoxregulationof pages 3-7, bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 7-9).\n\n6. Regulation  \nBRSK1 is regulated at multiple levels through phosphorylation, lipid modification, and redox-dependent mechanisms. Its full activation is dependent on phosphorylation of a conserved threonine residue (Thr-189) in the activation loop by the upstream kinase LKB1, which is essential for its catalytic activation in neurons and other cell types (aguirre2014lkb1ampktsc2signalingpathway pages 56-60, lyn2011theregulationofa pages 65-70). In addition, BRSK1 activity is modulated by post-translational modifications such as palmitoylation; this lipid modification promotes association with membrane lipid rafts in neurons, which is linked to increased kinase activity and enhanced T-loop phosphorylation (asiain2012regulaciónyfunción pages 82-89, babot2014regulaciódela pages 221-225). Redox regulation also plays a significant role; reversible oxidative modifications of conserved cysteine residues within the kinase domain, including those forming intramolecular disulfide bonds, can alter the catalytic activity of BRSK1 in response to cellular redox changes (bendzunas2024redoxregulationof pages 15-18, bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 14-15). Moreover, phosphorylation by Protein Kinase C epsilon on serine residues (S555 and S559) has been shown to negatively regulate BRSK1 activity without affecting its subcellular localization (koduri2024proteinkinasec pages 13-21, koduri2024proteinkinasecb pages 13-21).\n\n7. Function  \nBRSK1 plays a central role in neuronal polarization and centrosome duplication. In cortical neurons, following activation by LKB1, BRSK1 phosphorylates microtubule-associated protein tau at residues including Thr-529 and Ser-579, which is implicated in the establishment of neuronal polarity (aguirre2014lkb1ampktsc2signalingpathway pages 56-60, lyn2011theregulationofa pages 65-70). Additionally, BRSK1 phosphorylates WEE1 at Ser-642 in postmitotic neurons, leading to the down-regulation of WEE1 kinase activity—a key regulatory step in neuronal polarization (aguirre2014lkb1ampktsc2signalingpathway pages 56-60). Beyond its roles in neuronal differentiation, BRSK1 is involved in centrosome duplication where it phosphorylates gamma-tubulin isoforms (TUBG1 and TUBG2) at Ser-131; this phosphorylation promotes the translocation of gamma-tubulin and its associated proteins to the centrosome, thereby positively regulating centrosome duplication (aguirre2014lkb1ampktsc2signalingpathway pages 56-60). BRSK1 is also localized to synaptic vesicles within neurons, potentially influencing neurotransmitter release through phosphorylation of synaptic regulatory proteins such as RIMS1 (asiain2012regulaciónyfunciónc pages 82-89, babot2014regulaciódela pages 231-232). In the context of DNA damage response, BRSK1 participates in the UV-induced checkpoint response by modulating CDK1 activity through phosphorylation and activation of WEE1 and inhibition of CDC25B and CDC25C (aguirre2014lkb1ampktsc2signalingpathway pages 56-60).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nWhile specific chemical inhibitors for BRSK1 have not been detailed in the provided literature, its critical roles in neuronal polarization, centrosome duplication, and DNA damage checkpoint response make it a potential target for therapeutic intervention in neurodevelopmental disorders and cancers associated with dysregulated LKB1 signaling (banerjee2013phosphorylationubiquitylationanda pages 35-39, peart2014distinctrolesofa pages 70-73). No extensive data regarding disease-causing mutations in BRSK1 are provided in the current context; however, alterations in upstream regulators such as LKB1, which directly activates BRSK1, have been associated with tumor suppressor functions and could impact BRSK1 activity (henriksson2012lkb1signalingpathwaysb pages 30-33).\n\n9.

Phosphorylates CDK16, CDC25C, MAPT/TAU, PAK1 and WEE1. Following phosphorylation and activation by STK11/LKB1, acts as a key regulator of polarization of cortical neurons, probably by mediating phosphorylation of microtubule-associated proteins such as MAPT/TAU at 'Thr-529' and 'Ser-579'. Also regulates neuron polarization by mediating phosphorylation of WEE1 at 'Ser-642' in postmitotic neurons, leading to down-regulate WEE1 activity in polarized neurons. Plays a role in the regulation of the mitotic cell cycle progress and the onset of mitosis. Plays a role in the regulation of insulin secretion in response to elevated glucose levels, probably via phosphorylation of CDK16 and PAK1. While BRSK2 phosphorylated at Thr-174 can inhibit insulin secretion (PubMed:22798068), BRSK2 phosphorylated at Thr-260 can promote insulin secretion (PubMed:22669945). Regulates reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695).

Phylogeny  \nSerine/threonine‐protein kinase BRSK2 is a member of the AMPK‐related kinase family, a group that includes 14 kinases such as BRSK1, NUAK1, NUAK2, and others, all of which share a conserved serine/threonine kinase catalytic domain (bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 2-3). BRSK2 exhibits a brain‐selective expression pattern that distinguishes it from many other family members, and its close paralog, BRSK1, has over 95% sequence identity in the kinase domain, underscoring their shared evolutionary origin in vertebrates (bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 2-3, jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 12-14). Phylogenetic analyses indicate that BRSK2 and its orthologs can be traced back to early AMPK‐related kinase precursors present in the common ancestor of vertebrates, and its evolutionary conservation is highlighted by the persistence of functionally critical cysteine residues that mediate redox regulation (bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 2-3, bendzunas2024redoxregulationof pages 15-18). These conserved features, including the unique ‘CPE’ motif found in BRSK2, reflect an evolutionary adaptation that likely supports specialized roles in neuronal signaling and metabolic control.  \n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nBRSK2 catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues on its substrate proteins. The reaction can be summarized as: ATP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 2-3). This reaction is typical of serine/threonine kinases and is critical for modulating the activity of downstream signaling proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, neuronal polarity, and metabolic processes.  \n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of BRSK2 is dependent on the presence of ATP as the phosphate donor, and like many serine/threonine kinases, it requires divalent metal ions—most commonly Mg²⁺—as essential cofactors to facilitate the proper binding and orientation of ATP in the active site (timm2008structureandregulation pages 2-4, bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 2-3). The dependence on these cofactors is critical for the catalytic mechanism that governs phosphate transfer and substrate modification.  \n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nBRSK2 phosphorylates a variety of substrates, thereby modulating diverse cellular processes. Notably, it phosphorylates microtubule-associated proteins such as MAPT/TAU at specific residues (for example, phosphorylation at Ser262 has been demonstrated), as well as regulatory proteins involved in cell cycle progression and insulin secretion such as CDC25C, CDK16, PAK1, and WEE1 (Information section; bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 3-5). Although a definitive consensus motif for substrate recognition by BRSK2 has not been fully delineated as it has for some other serine/threonine kinases, the available data indicate that its activity modulates proteins involved in neuronal polarity and cytoskeletal reorganization, consistent with its prominent expression in brain tissue (Information section, jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 12-14). The phosphorylation events mediated by BRSK2 are essential in the fine-tuning of downstream signaling pathways, especially those linked to microtubule dynamics and cell cycle checkpoint control.  \n\n5. Structure  \nBRSK2 contains a central serine/threonine kinase catalytic domain that exhibits the typical bi-lobal architecture observed in eukaryotic protein kinases. This core is flanked by regulatory modules, including an N-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain and a C-terminal spacer that, in some family members, is extended to include kinase-associated (KA1) domains (bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 2-3, bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 3-5). The kinase domain itself is characterized by an activation loop (T-loop) whose phosphorylation status—particularly at Thr174—is critical for full activation by the upstream kinase LKB1 (Information section; bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 2-3, bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 5-7). Unique features of BRSK2 include the presence of highly conserved cysteine residues within the catalytic domain; one such residue is located at the T-loop +2 position while other critical residues form a distinct ‘CPE’ motif that replaces the conventional APE motif found in many kinases (bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 15-17, bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 7-9). Structural studies using AlphaFold predictions as well as molecular dynamics simulations have provided insight into how these cysteine residues contribute to redox regulation, suggesting they may form reversible disulfide bonds that modulate the kinase’s conformation and catalytic efficiency (bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 14-15, jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 24-26). In solution, BRSK2 is predominantly monomeric; however, redox-sensitive intermolecular disulfide bond formation can lead to transient dimerization under oxidative conditions (bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 7-9). The overall 3D organization—comprising the conserved catalytic domain, regulatory UBA domain, and flexible C-terminal sequences—correlates with its ability to integrate multiple regulatory inputs, including phosphorylation and redox stimuli, to achieve fine control over kinase activity.  \n\n6. Regulation  \nBRSK2 activity is tightly regulated by both phosphorylation and reversible redox modifications. A critical regulatory mechanism involves phosphorylation of the activation loop by the upstream kinase LKB1, which phosphorylates a threonine residue (Thr174) in the T-loop, thus promoting the active conformation of BRSK2 (Information section; bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 2-3, katajisto2007thelkb1tumor pages 4-5). In addition to this phosphorylation event, BRSK2 is subject to further regulation by other kinases including CAMKII, PAK1, and PKA (Information section). A distinguishing regulatory feature of BRSK2 is its modulation by redox mechanisms; conserved cysteine residues within the kinase domain undergo reversible oxidation—for example, oxidation to sulfenic acid states or the formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds—thereby altering the enzyme’s catalytic activity (bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 12-14, tamir2020pkisdeepdive pages 1-3). Mutational analyses have shown that substitution of these redox-sensitive cysteines (including those at the T-loop +2 and within the CPE motif) can either reduce basal activity or lead to increased activity in the absence of redox regulation, underscoring their functional importance (bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 15-17, banerjee2013phosphorylationubiquitylationand pages 35-39). Furthermore, cellular exposure to oxidative agents such as hydrogen peroxide results in inhibition of kinase activity, while treatment with reducing agents like DTT or glutathione restores activity, thereby highlighting the dynamic regulation of BRSK2 by intracellular redox states (tamir2020pkisdeepdive pages 3-5, bendzunas2024redoxregulationof pages 20-23). This dual regulation by phosphorylation and reversible redox modifications allows BRSK2 to integrate diverse signals and adjust its activity in response to both metabolic and oxidative changes in the cellular environment.  \n\n7. Function  \nBRSK2 plays essential roles in multiple cellular processes that are critical for proper neuronal function and cellular homeostasis. It is predominantly expressed in the brain and central nervous system, where it has been shown to act as a key regulator of neuronal polarization and axonogenesis. Through phosphorylation of substrates such as MAPT/TAU—at residues including Ser262—and likely other microtubule-associated proteins, BRSK2 contributes to the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics and neuronal polarity (Information section; bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 2-3, bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 3-5). In postmitotic neurons, BRSK2 mediates the phosphorylation of WEE1 at Ser642, leading to down-regulation of WEE1 activity, which is critical for establishing and maintaining neuronal polarity (Information section). Additionally, BRSK2 influences the cell cycle by phosphorylating regulators such as CDC25C, thereby playing a role in the progression and onset of mitosis (Information section). Beyond its functions in neuronal differentiation and cell cycle regulation, BRSK2 is implicated in the regulation of insulin secretion. Differential phosphorylation states of BRSK2—such as phosphorylated Thr174, which can inhibit insulin secretion, versus phosphorylated Thr260, which can promote insulin secretion—demonstrate its involvement in glucose-stimulated insulin release, likely through modification of substrates including CDK16 and PAK1 (Information section; bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 2-3). Moreover, BRSK2 has been associated with the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and may play a role in the apoptotic response triggered by endoplasmic reticulum stress, highlighting its broader influence on cellular survival and stress responses (Information section). The functions of BRSK2, therefore, encompass critical roles in neuronal development, cell cycle progression, metabolic regulation, and stress response, placing it at the intersection of signaling pathways vital for maintaining neuronal and systemic homeostasis.  \n\n8. Other Comments  \nExperimental inhibitors such as GW296115 have been identified as cell-active chemical probes targeting BRSK2, exhibiting potent inhibitory activity in biochemical and cellular assays; however, these inhibitors show moderate selectivity as they also inhibit other kinases, and no inhibitor has yet progressed to clinical development (tamir2020pkisdeepdive pages 16-18, tamir2020pkisdeepdive pages 9-11, nguyen2008targetingrskan pages 5-6). Genetic and biochemical studies have linked BRSK2 to neurodevelopmental disorders including autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, based primarily on its essential role in regulating neuronal polarity and cytoskeletal dynamics (Information section; bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 2-3). In addition, dysregulation of BRSK2 activity—either through aberrant phosphorylation or altered redox modification—may contribute to neurodegenerative conditions given its role in Tau phosphorylation, a process implicated in Alzheimer’s disease and related tauopathies (Information section; bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 26-26). There is also evidence that BRSK2 impacts insulin secretion; its differential phosphorylation states modulate the secretory response to glucose, suggesting potential relevance in metabolic disorders. Although several chemical probes have been described for related kinases, the development of highly selective inhibitors for BRSK2 remains an active area of research, and these tools continue to be refined using advanced assay platforms such as NanoBRET and kinome-wide profiling (tamir2020pkisdeepdive pages 1-3, tamir2020pkisdeepdive pages 3-5).  \n\n9.

Constitutes the main protein kinase for extracellular proteins, generating the majority of the extracellular phosphoproteome (PubMed:26091039). Mainly phosphorylates proteins within the Ser-x-Glu/pSer motif, but also displays a broader substrate specificity (PubMed:26091039). Phosphorylates ERO1A, enhancing its activity which is required to maintain endoplasmic reticulum redox homeostasis and for oxidative protein folding (PubMed:29858230, PubMed:34349020). During endoplasmic reticulum stress, phosphorylates P4HB/PDIA1 which induces a functional switch, causing P4HB to change from an oxidoreductase to a molecular chaperone (PubMed:32149426). This is critical to maintain ER proteostasis and reduce cell death under ER stress (PubMed:32149426). Phosphorylation of P4HB also promotes its interaction with ERN1, leading to reduced activity of ERN1, a key sensor for the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response (PubMed:32149426). Required for osteoblast differentiation and mineralization (PubMed:34349020). Phosphorylates casein as well as a number of proteins involved in biomineralization such as AMELX, AMTN, ENAM and SPP1/OPN (PubMed:22582013, PubMed:25789606, PubMed:34349020). In addition to its role in biomineralization, also plays a role in lipid homeostasis, wound healing and cell migration and adhesion (PubMed:26091039)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nFAM20C belongs to the FAM20 family of secreted protein kinases and is evolutionarily conserved across metazoans. Orthologs of FAM20C have been identified from Caenorhabditis elegans up to mammals, and its homologs include paralogs FAM20A and FAM20B, which are expressed in vertebrates and even in some invertebrate species involved in biomineralization or extracellular matrix regulation (chen2021proteolyticprocessingof pages 1-2, zhang2018structureandevolution pages 1-2). FAM20C is classified as a Golgi-resident kinase historically referred to as Golgi casein kinase or DMP4. Phylogenetic studies demonstrate that FAM20C and other family members diverge early from the canonical eukaryotic protein kinase superfamily, representing a distinct group whose evolutionary origins trace back at least to the common ancestor of animals and perhaps before (gersongurwitz2018ancestralrolesof pages 40-42, palmalara2021fam20coverviewclassic pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nFAM20C catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to serine residues on substrate proteins, leading to the formation of ADP and a phosphorylated protein product. In chemical terms, the reaction is as follows:  \n  ATP + [protein]-L-serine (or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-O-phosphoserine (or phosphothreonine) + H⁺  \nThis reaction is performed within the secretory pathway and is central to the generation of the extracellular phosphoproteome (tagliabracci2012secretedkinasephosphorylates pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nFAM20C requires divalent cations for catalytic activity, with a strong preference for manganese ions (Mn²⁺) over magnesium ions (Mg²⁺) under in vitro conditions. The kinase activity has been optimized using elevated concentrations of MnCl₂ in biochemical assays, suggesting that Mn²⁺ acts as a critical cofactor in coordinating the phosphate transfer from ATP to the substrate (cozza2015“genuine”caseinkinase pages 9-12, cui2015asecretorykinase pages 4-6).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nFAM20C displays a strong substrate preference for secretory pathway phosphoproteins. It phosphorylates serine residues within a defined consensus motif, most commonly the Ser-x-Glu (S-x-E) sequence or with a phosphorylated serine at the +2 position (Ser-x-pSer). Although its substrate scope has been shown to be broad, the primary known motif is S-x-E/pS, which accounts for the majority of the phosphorylated sites present in secreted proteins. This specificity underlies its role as the main kinase generating the extracellular phosphoproteome and includes substrates such as casein as well as several proteins involved in biomineralization (chen2021proteolyticprocessingof pages 1-2, cozza2015anewrole pages 1-2, sreelatha2015thesecretorypathway pages 6-7).\n\n5. Structure  \nFAM20C is a type II transmembrane serine/threonine kinase predominantly localized in the Golgi apparatus. Its structure comprises an N-terminal signal peptide and a short transmembrane domain (approximately 20 amino acids) that mediate its retention within the Golgi membranes (chen2021proteolyticprocessingof pages 1-2, palmalara2021fam20coverviewclassic pages 2-4). The catalytic kinase domain is positioned in the lumen and exhibits an atypical protein kinase fold. Notably, crystal structures from its Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog reveal a two-lobe arrangement consisting of an N-lobe with 18 α-helices and a C-lobe with nine β-strands. Unlike canonical kinases, FAM20C lacks a readily identifiable activation loop and possesses a unique insertion domain that forms a cap-like structure over the active site. Key catalytic features include conserved residues for ATP binding and metal ion coordination, such as a catalytic aspartate and residues contributing to the hydrophobic spine and the position of the regulatory αC helix. These features support a constitutively active architecture optimized for efficient catalysis in the secretory environment (xiao2013crystalstructureof pages 1-1, xiao2013crystalstructureof pages 5-6, palmalara2021fam20coverviewclassic pages 32-33).\n\n6. Regulation  \nFAM20C is regulated via post-translational modifications and interactions that influence its localization and activity. Proteolytic processing plays a critical role in its regulation; the kinase undergoes cleavage of an N-terminal propeptide by the Golgi-resident site-1 protease (S1P), a reaction that enhances its secretion and enzymatic activity (chen2021proteolyticprocessingof pages 8-10). In addition, FAM20C forms homo- and heterodimers, with the latter involving the binding of the pseudokinase FAM20A. Although FAM20A lacks catalytic activity, it acts as an allosteric activator that increases FAM20C’s activity and promotes its extracellular secretion (ohyama2016fam20abindsto pages 1-2, cui2015asecretorykinase pages 11-13). Other layers of regulation are mediated by cellular stresses and possibly by lipid-derived molecules such as sphingosine that have been shown to stimulate kinase activity, although detailed molecular mechanisms remain under investigation (cozza2017fam20cisunder pages 15-17).\n\n7. Function  \nFAM20C is critical for the phosphorylation of secreted proteins and thereby plays a key role in biomineralization processes. It phosphorylates enamel matrix proteins (such as amelogenin, ameloblastin, enamelin, and amelotin) and dentin matrix proteins (including dentin matrix protein 1) that are essential for proper tooth development and bone mineralization. In addition, FAM20C phosphorylates extracellular proteins such as osteopontin, which function to regulate hydroxyapatite formation and mineral deposition in skeletal tissues (liu2018fam20cregulatesosteoblast pages 1-3, ishikawa2012therainesyndrome pages 1-2). Beyond its role in biomineralization, FAM20C regulates endoplasmic reticulum proteostasis by phosphorylating ERO1A and P4HB, thereby modulating oxidative protein folding and ER stress responses. Expression patterns indicate that FAM20C is present in tissues with high secretory activity, including bone, teeth, lactating mammary glands, and various other secretory epithelia. This central role in extracellular protein phosphorylation makes FAM20C integral to pathways governing osteoblast differentiation, mineral metabolism, cell migration, adhesion, and lipid homeostasis (chen2021proteolyticprocessingof pages 1-2, ishikawa2012therainesyndrome pages 2-3, palmalara2021fam20coverviewclassic pages 2-4).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nFAM20C mutations are causally linked with Raine syndrome, a rare osteosclerotic bone dysplasia characterized by abnormal bone mineralization, craniofacial dysmorphisms, dental defects, and in many cases neonatal lethality. In addition, altered FAM20C activity has been associated with hypophosphatemic rickets and defective enamel formation. No highly selective direct inhibitors of FAM20C have been described; however, its responsiveness to agents such as sphingosine and related compounds indicates potential avenues for pharmacological modulation aimed at enhancing kinase activity in disease contexts. Moreover, FAM20C phosphorylates a broad spectrum of secreted substrates that include not only classical biomineralization proteins but also factors involved in lipid homeostasis, cell migration, and wound healing, thereby expanding its functional profile beyond traditional roles in bone and tooth development (cozza2015anewrole pages 7-8, ishikawa2012therainesyndrome pages 1-2, venerando2022editorialcaseinkinases pages 4-5).\n\n9.

In response to reduction of intracellular ATP levels, AMPK activates energy-producing pathways and inhibits energy-consuming processes: inhibits protein, carbohydrate and lipid biosynthesis, as well as cell growth and proliferation (PubMed:17307971, PubMed:17712357). AMPK acts via direct phosphorylation of metabolic enzymes, and by longer-term effects via phosphorylation of transcription regulators (PubMed:17307971, PubMed:17712357). Regulates lipid synthesis by phosphorylating and inactivating lipid metabolic enzymes such as ACACA, ACACB, GYS1, HMGCR and LIPE; regulates fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis by phosphorylating acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACACA and ACACB) and hormone-sensitive lipase (LIPE) enzymes, respectively (By similarity). Promotes lipolysis of lipid droplets by mediating phosphorylation of isoform 1 of CHKA (CHKalpha2) (PubMed:34077757). Regulates insulin-signaling and glycolysis by phosphorylating IRS1, PFKFB2 and PFKFB3 (By similarity). AMPK stimulates glucose uptake in muscle by increasing the translocation of the glucose transporter SLC2A4/GLUT4 to the plasma membrane, possibly by mediating phosphorylation of TBC1D4/AS160 (By similarity). Regulates transcription and chromatin structure by phosphorylating transcription regulators involved in energy metabolism such as CRTC2/TORC2, FOXO3, histone H2B, HDAC5, MEF2C, MLXIPL/ChREBP, EP300, HNF4A, p53/TP53, SREBF1, SREBF2 and PPARGC1A (PubMed:11518699, PubMed:11554766, PubMed:15866171, PubMed:17711846, PubMed:18184930). Acts as a key regulator of glucose homeostasis in liver by phosphorylating CRTC2/TORC2, leading to CRTC2/TORC2 sequestration in the cytoplasm (By similarity). In response to stress, phosphorylates 'Ser-36' of histone H2B (H2BS36ph), leading to promote transcription (By similarity). Acts as a key regulator of cell growth and proliferation by phosphorylating FNIP1, TSC2, RPTOR, WDR24 and ATG1/ULK1: in response to nutrient limitation, negatively regulates the mTORC1 complex by phosphorylating RPTOR component of the mTORC1 complex and by phosphorylating and activating TSC2 (PubMed:14651849, PubMed:18439900, PubMed:20160076, PubMed:21205641). Also phosphorylates and inhibits GATOR2 subunit WDR24 in response to nutrient limitation, leading to suppress glucose-mediated mTORC1 activation (PubMed:36732624). In response to energetic stress, phosphorylates FNIP1, inactivating the non-canonical mTORC1 signaling, thereby promoting nuclear translocation of TFEB and TFE3, and inducing transcription of lysosomal or autophagy genes (PubMed:37079666). In response to nutrient limitation, promotes autophagy by phosphorylating and activating ATG1/ULK1 (PubMed:21205641). In that process, it also activates WDR45/WIPI4 (PubMed:28561066). Phosphorylates CASP6, thereby preventing its autoprocessing and subsequent activation (PubMed:32029622). In response to nutrient limitation, phosphorylates transcription factor FOXO3 promoting FOXO3 mitochondrial import (By similarity). Also acts as a regulator of cellular polarity by remodeling the actin cytoskeleton; probably by indirectly activating myosin (PubMed:17486097). AMPK also acts as a regulator of circadian rhythm by mediating phosphorylation of CRY1, leading to destabilize it (By similarity). May regulate the Wnt signaling pathway by phosphorylating CTNNB1, leading to stabilize it (By similarity). Also has tau-protein kinase activity: in response to amyloid beta A4 protein (APP) exposure, activated by CAMKK2, leading to phosphorylation of MAPT/TAU; however the relevance of such data remains unclear in vivo (By similarity). Also phosphorylates CFTR, EEF2K, KLC1, NOS3 and SLC12A1 (PubMed:12519745, PubMed:20074060). Regulates hepatic lipogenesis. Activated via SIRT3, represses sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) transcriptional activities and ATP-consuming lipogenesis to restore cellular energy balance. Upon stress, regulates mitochondrial fragmentation through phosphorylation of MTFR1L (PubMed:36367943)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \n5′-AMP-activated protein kinase catalytic subunit alpha‑1 (PRKAA1/AMPK1) is a highly conserved serine/threonine kinase that belongs to the SNF1/AMPK family of energy sensor kinases. Orthologs of PRKAA1 are found in all eukaryotic organisms, ranging from yeast—as exemplified by the Snf1 protein—to plants, nematodes, and mammals. This broad conservation underscores an evolutionary history confined to a core set of kinases that emerged early in eukaryotic evolution and have been maintained due to their indispensable role in mediating cellular energy and nutrient signaling (faubert2015lkb1andampk pages 51-56, hardie2016regulationofampactivated pages 6-7). Within the human kinome, PRKAA1 is classified in the CAMK (calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase) group and is part of an ancient regulatory network alongside kinases such as LKB1 and the related AMPK‐related kinases. Recent phylogenetic analyses indicate that gene duplications gave rise to two alpha isoforms—alpha‑1 (PRKAA1) and alpha‑2 (PRKAA2)—with PRKAA1 being ubiquitously expressed in virtually all tissues, while the alpha‑2 isoform is more restricted to tissues such as skeletal and cardiac muscle (mihaylova2012hownutrientsenergy pages 240-245, varaciruelos2019thestrangecase pages 2-3). Thus, PRKAA1 is an essential component of the conserved SNF1/AMPK signaling axis, reflecting both its ancestral function and the stringent evolutionary pressures that have maintained its catalytic domain integrity across species.\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nThe catalytic function of PRKAA1/AMPK1 conforms to the canonical mechanism of serine/threonine kinases in which a phosphate group is transferred from ATP to a hydroxyl group on substrate proteins. The chemical reaction can be represented as follows:  \nATP + [protein]–OH → ADP + [protein]–O‑PO₃²⁻ + H⁺  \nIn this reaction, ATP, usually in the form of Mg·ATP, binds to the kinase domain, and the conserved active site directs the terminal γ-phosphate to the serine or threonine residue present in a substrate protein. This phosphorylation event alters the target protein’s conformation and activity, thereby modulating metabolic pathways crucial for energy homeostasis (altarejos2005molecularandhormonalc pages 43-48, dandapani2013theampksignalling pages 46-50).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nFor efficient catalysis, PRKAA1/AMPK1 requires the presence of divalent metal ions, with magnesium being the most critical. Mg²⁺ forms a complex with ATP, resulting in Mg·ATP²⁻, which is essential for proper substrate alignment in the kinase’s active site and facilitates the nucleophilic attack by the substrate hydroxyl group. Structural and enzymatic studies have consistently demonstrated that without Mg²⁺, the phosphorylation reaction is severely impaired, underscoring the ion’s key role in stabilizing the transition state and influencing catalytic rates (hardie2016regulationofampactivated pages 2-3, cameron2016recentprogressin pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nPRKAA1/AMPK1 displays a defined substrate specificity that is determined by a consensus phosphorylation motif. Biochemical studies, including positional scanning peptide library analyses, have revealed that optimal substrates for AMPK contain basic residues—typically arginine—at the −3 and −4 positions relative to the phosphoacceptor serine or threonine residue. Furthermore, hydrophobic residues such as leucine or methionine are favored at the +4 and +5 positions, and polar residues (for example, asparagine or aspartate) are often present at the +3 position. In several cases, a proline residue at the +2 position has been noted to enhance substrate recognition and facilitate the binding of regulatory 14-3-3 proteins. Summarizing these observations, the optimal motif for phosphorylation by PRKAA1/AMPK1 can be represented as R‑X‑X‑p(S/T)‑X‑P, although additional hydrophobic and polar preferences serve to fine‑tune substrate selection. This specificity enables AMPK to selectively target proteins involved in lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and other energy-dependent processes (mihaylova2012hownutrientsenergy pages 269-273, smiles2024themetabolicsensor pages 3-5, dandapani2013theampksignalling pages 46-50).\n\n5. Structure  \nThe three-dimensional structure of PRKAA1/AMPK1 is modular, comprising several distinct regions that jointly ensure both catalytic proficiency and regulatory flexibility. The N‑terminal region features a highly conserved serine/threonine kinase domain that adopts the classical bilobal architecture common to eukaryotic kinases. The smaller N‑lobe consists primarily of β‑sheets and a conserved C‑helix, while the larger C‑lobe is predominantly helical and contains the activation loop—a flexible segment that hosts the key phosphorylatable residue, Thr172. Phosphorylation at Thr172 is central to establishing an active conformation, as it effectively reorganizes the catalytic machinery, aligns the hydrophobic spine, and stabilizes the proper orientation of the active site (hardie2016regulationofampactivated pages 6-7, smiles2024themetabolicsensor pages 2-3).\n\nDirectly following the kinase domain, an auto‑inhibitory domain (AID) is present; in the inactive state, the AID interacts with the kinase domain, thereby suppressing catalytic activity. Upon activation by upstream kinases or allosteric effectors, the AID undergoes conformational changes that relieve its inhibitory grip, allowing full catalytic function. Subsequent to the AID lies the linker region, which contains regulatory interacting motifs (a‑RIMs) that play a pivotal role in communicating with the γ‑subunit. This interaction is essential for the nucleotide sensing mechanism, wherein AMP or ADP binding to the γ‑subunit induces conformational alterations transmitted via these RIMs to influence kinase activity. Additionally, the C‑terminal region of PRKAA1 includes a beta‑subunit interacting domain (b‑SID) that ensures proper heterotrimeric complex formation with the β‑ and γ‑subunits; within this region, elements such as a nuclear export signal (NES) and an ST loop subject to phosphorylation further refine the spatial regulation of the enzyme. Crystallographic data and AlphaFold models corroborate this modular organization, detailing how the catalytic and regulatory elements are intricately arranged to accommodate substrate binding, nucleotide recognition, and allosteric modulation (hardie2016regulationofampactivated pages 1-2, smiles2024themetabolicsensor pages 3-5, tamargogomez2018ampkregulationof pages 3-5, varaciruelos2019thestrangecase pages 2-3).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of PRKAA1/AMPK1 is characterized by a multi‑layered network of post‑translational modifications and nucleotide‑mediated allosteric interactions. Paramount among these regulatory events is the phosphorylation of Thr172 within the activation loop, a modification that increases the catalytic activity of AMPK by more than 100‑fold. This phosphorylation is predominantly executed by upstream kinases such as LKB1—thus serving as the major sensor of energy deficiency—along with contributions from Ca²⁺/calmodulin‑dependent protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ) and, in certain cellular contexts, transforming growth factor‑β‑activated kinase 1 (TAK1) (arad2007ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 3-4, dandapani2013theampksignalling pages 37-41). In parallel with this covalent modification, allosteric regulation occurs via the binding of AMP (and to a subordinate extent ADP) to conserved cystathionine‑β‑synthase (CBS) domains within the γ‑subunit. The binding of AMP results in three major consequences: (i) it directly allosterically activates the enzyme, (ii) it facilitates further phosphorylation of Thr172 by rendering the activation loop more accessible to kinase action, and (iii) it shields the phosphorylated Thr172 from dephosphorylation by phosphatases such as PP1, PP2A, and PP2C (dandapani2013theampksignalling pages 46-50, scanlon2021investigatingthecontribution pages 44-49). Conversely, ATP competes with AMP for binding at these sites and thus acts to attenuate AMPK activation. Additionally, inhibitory phosphorylation events have been reported, with specific serine residues (for example, Ser485 on the α‑subunit) serving to negatively modulate activity by interfering with the activation loop dynamics and subsequent conformational rearrangements (baskin2012regulationofprotein pages 49-53, russell2020ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 2-4). Collectively, these regulatory inputs enable PRKAA1/AMPK1 to function as a finely tuned sensor, rapidly adjusting its catalytic output in response to shifts in the intracellular energy landscape (faubert2015lkb1andampk pages 51-56, tamargogomez2018ampkregulationof pages 3-5).\n\n7. Function  \nFunctionally, PRKAA1/AMPK1 is central to the maintenance of cellular energy homeostasis, acting as a master metabolic sensor whose activation triggers a coordinated response to energy stress. PRKAA1 is ubiquitously expressed across a wide range of tissues, including liver, skeletal muscle, heart, brain, adipose tissue, and endothelial cells, as well as in immune cells such as macrophages. When intracellular ATP levels fall due to nutrient deprivation, hypoxia, or increased energy demand, AMPK becomes activated via Thr172 phosphorylation and AMP‑mediated allosteric mechanisms. Once activated, it orchestrates a shift in cellular metabolism by phosphorylating a wide array of substrates that regulate both anabolic and catabolic pathways. For instance, AMPK phosphorylates and inhibits key metabolic enzymes such as acetyl‑CoA carboxylase (ACACA/ACACB) to reduce fatty acid synthesis and promote fatty acid oxidation and simultaneously affects cholesterol metabolism by targeting hydroxymethylglutaryl‑CoA reductase (HMGCR) (altarejos2005molecularandhormonalc pages 43-48, russell2020ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 2-4). In terms of glucose metabolism, AMPK promotes glucose uptake through effects on the insulin signaling cascade and by regulating the translocation of glucose transporters, thus ensuring sufficient substrate availability for ATP production (herzig2018ampkguardianof pages 1-2, wang2012ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 1-2).\n\nBeyond the immediate modulation of metabolic enzyme activities, PRKAA1/AMPK1 influences longer‑term cellular adaptations via phosphorylation of transcriptional regulators. It modulates gene expression programs by targeting substrates such as the transcriptional co‑activator CRTC2, the forkhead box protein FOXO3, and histone proteins like H2B—thereby impacting mitochondrial biogenesis, autophagy, and cell survival pathways. Moreover, through the phosphorylation of key signaling regulators such as TSC2 and RPTOR, AMPK attenuates the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway under conditions of nutrient limitation, thereby integrating energy sensing with control over cell growth and proliferation. This expansive range of substrates positions PRKAA1/AMPK1 as a central node that coordinates diverse physiological processes related to metabolism, stress response, and even cytoskeletal organization (altarejos2005molecularandhormonalc pages 43-48, mohanty2025rethinkingampka pages 1-2, rhein2021investigationofphysiological pages 24-27, zhu2014regulationofmacrophage pages 21-26).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral pharmacological agents have been identified that modulate AMPK activity, reflecting its importance as a therapeutic target in metabolic disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and certain cancers. Activators such as metformin, AICAR, A-769662, and compound 991 have been extensively studied for their ability to elevate cellular AMP levels or mimic its binding at the γ‑subunit, thereby enhancing Thr172 phosphorylation and promoting a catabolic state that favors ATP generation. These compounds are instrumental in experimental models and clinical settings for their capacity to restore energy balance in conditions of metabolic stress (dandapani2013theampksignalling pages 46-50, scanlon2021investigatingthecontribution pages 44-49). In addition, dysregulation of the AMPK pathway has been linked to a variety of disease states including type 2 diabetes, obesity, and specific forms of cancer, thereby making PRKAA1 an important focus of drug discovery efforts. Although direct evidence for post‑translational modifications such as ubiquitination or acetylation on PRKAA1 itself is limited within the current literature, phosphorylation and nucleotide‐mediated regulation remain the principal mechanisms of control. Thus, PRKAA1/AMPK1 is central not only to acute metabolic control but also to long‑term adaptive responses to energetic stress, with its activity tightly modulated by a network of upstream kinases and allosteric effectors (altarejos2005molecularandhormonalc pages 43-48, russell2020ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 2-4).\n\n9.

MAPK11 is one of the four p38 MAPKs which play an important role in the cascades of cellular responses evoked by extracellular stimuli such as pro-inflammatory cytokines or physical stress leading to direct activation of transcription factors (PubMed:12452429, PubMed:20626350, PubMed:35857590). Accordingly, p38 MAPKs phosphorylate a broad range of proteins and it has been estimated that they may have approximately 200 to 300 substrates each (PubMed:12452429, PubMed:20626350, PubMed:35857590). MAPK11 functions are mostly redundant with those of MAPK14 (PubMed:12452429, PubMed:20626350, PubMed:35857590). Some of the targets are downstream kinases which are activated through phosphorylation and further phosphorylate additional targets (PubMed:12452429, PubMed:20626350). RPS6KA5/MSK1 and RPS6KA4/MSK2 can directly phosphorylate and activate transcription factors such as CREB1, ATF1, the NF-kappa-B isoform RELA/NFKB3, STAT1 and STAT3, but can also phosphorylate histone H3 and the nucleosomal protein HMGN1 (PubMed:9687510). RPS6KA5/MSK1 and RPS6KA4/MSK2 play important roles in the rapid induction of immediate-early genes in response to stress or mitogenic stimuli, either by inducing chromatin remodeling or by recruiting the transcription machinery. On the other hand, two other kinase targets, MAPKAPK2/MK2 and MAPKAPK3/MK3, participate in the control of gene expression mostly at the post-transcriptional level, by phosphorylating ZFP36 (tristetraprolin) and ELAVL1, and by regulating EEF2K, which is important for the elongation of mRNA during translation. MKNK1/MNK1 and MKNK2/MNK2, two other kinases activated by p38 MAPKs, regulate protein synthesis by phosphorylating the initiation factor EIF4E2 (PubMed:11154262). In the cytoplasm, the p38 MAPK pathway is an important regulator of protein turnover. For example, CFLAR is an inhibitor of TNF-induced apoptosis whose proteasome-mediated degradation is regulated by p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Ectodomain shedding of transmembrane proteins is regulated by p38 MAPKs as well. In response to inflammatory stimuli, p38 MAPKs phosphorylate the membrane-associated metalloprotease ADAM17. Such phosphorylation is required for ADAM17-mediated ectodomain shedding of TGF-alpha family ligands, which results in the activation of EGFR signaling and cell proliferation. Additional examples of p38 MAPK substrates are the FGFR1. FGFR1 can be translocated from the extracellular space into the cytosol and nucleus of target cells, and regulates processes such as rRNA synthesis and cell growth. FGFR1 translocation requires p38 MAPK activation. In the nucleus, many transcription factors are phosphorylated and activated by p38 MAPKs in response to different stimuli. Classical examples include ATF1, ATF2, ATF6, ELK1, PTPRH, DDIT3, TP53/p53 and MEF2C and MEF2A (PubMed:10330143, PubMed:15356147, PubMed:9430721). The p38 MAPKs are emerging as important modulators of gene expression by regulating chromatin modifiers and remodelers (PubMed:10330143, PubMed:15356147, PubMed:9430721). The promoters of several genes involved in the inflammatory response, such as IL6, IL8 and IL12B, display a p38 MAPK-dependent enrichment of histone H3 phosphorylation on 'Ser-10' (H3S10ph) in LPS-stimulated myeloid cells. This phosphorylation enhances the accessibility of the cryptic NF-kappa-B-binding sites marking promoters for increased NF-kappa-B recruitment. Phosphorylates NLRP1 downstream of MAP3K20/ZAK in response to UV-B irradiation and ribosome collisions, promoting activation of the NLRP1 inflammasome and pyroptosis (PubMed:35857590). Phosphorylates methyltransferase DOT1L on 'Ser-834', 'Thr-900', 'Ser-902', 'Thr-984', 'Ser-1001', 'Ser-1009' and 'Ser-1104' (PubMed:38270553)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1.

Phylogeny – MAPK11, also designated as p38 beta, is a member of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase family that comprises four isoforms: p38α (MAPK14), p38β (MAPK11), p38γ (MAPK12), and p38δ. MAPK11 is evolutionarily conserved among vertebrates and shares approximately 75% amino acid sequence identity with p38α, its closest relative, reflecting its origin from an ancestral kinase duplication event in the common ancestor of mammals and other eukaryotes (moralesmartinez2024p38mapkmolecular pages 1-2, krens1887molecularcellbiolog(ibl) pages 44-49, caffrey1999theevolutionof pages 13-14). The protein is classified within the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) subgroup of the MAPK superfamily, which is activated primarily in response to environmental stressors such as pro-inflammatory cytokines, UV, and osmotic stress. Sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses confirm that MAPK11 exists as an ortholog across multiple species, with similar catalytic and regulatory domains that define the p38 MAPK subfamily (moralesmartinez2024p38mapkmolecular pages 1-2, krens1887molecularcellbiolog(ibl) pages 54-58).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed – MAPK11 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to serine and threonine residues on substrate proteins. The chemical reaction can be summarized as: ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺. This phosphorylation event is essential for transmitting downstream signals and modulating the activity of a broad repertoire of substrates—in some cases estimated to be between 200 and 300 proteins—thereby regulating diverse cellular processes such as inflammation, apoptosis, and differentiation (moralesmartinez2024p38mapkmolecular pages 4-6).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements – The kinase activity of MAPK11 depends on the binding of ATP as the phosphate donor, a common characteristic of serine/threonine kinases. In addition, the enzymatic reaction requires divalent metal ions, with Mg²⁺ being the principal cofactor that facilitates ATP binding and catalysis, ensuring proper orientation and stabilization of the phosphoryl transfer reaction (moralesmartinez2024p38mapkmolecular pages 4-6, lu2016molecularcloningand pages 2-4).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity – MAPK11 exhibits substrate specificity for serine/threonine residues, phosphorylating a wide array of target proteins involved in signal transduction pathways. Among its substrates are various transcription factors such as activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2), members of the myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) family, and others that require phosphorylation to modulate gene expression in response to stress signals (moralesmartinez2024p38moleculartargeting pages 22-23). With an estimated substrate repertoire of 200 to 300 proteins, the kinase prefers substrate motifs that are consistent with serine/threonine kinases; however, the precise consensus motif remains broad given the overlapping functions with other p38 isoforms (moralesmartinez2024p38mapkmolecular pages 4-6, badrinarayan2011sequencestructureand pages 1-2).\n\n5. Structure – The three-dimensional structure of MAPK11 is characterized by a central kinase domain spanning residues 24 to 308, which houses the catalytic machinery responsible for its serine/threonine kinase activity. Within this domain, a dual phosphorylation motif (TXY) located at residues 180–182 is critical for activation via phosphorylation by upstream MAPKKs. Furthermore, two ATP-binding sites have been identified at residues 30–38 and residue 53, which are essential for binding ATP and facilitating the enzymatic reaction (moralesmartinez2024p38mapkmolecular pages 4-6). The overall structure conforms to the classical MAPK fold, comprising a smaller N-terminal lobe rich in β-sheets and a larger, predominantly α-helical C-terminal lobe; these two lobes are connected by a flexible hinge region responsible for proper substrate positioning (patel2009thethreedimensionalstructure pages 1-2). Key structural elements such as the Gly-rich loop, the catalytic loop, and the activation segment containing the TXY motif are conserved among MAPK family members. In addition, crystallographic studies have revealed that certain conformational differences, for example in the positioning of the ATP-binding pocket, may account for isoform-specific inhibitor binding properties when compared with p38α (moralesmartinez2024p38mapkmolecular pages 4-6, patel2009thethreedimensionalstructure pages 1-2).\n\n6. Regulation – Activation of MAPK11 requires the dual phosphorylation of its TXY motif (Thr180 and Tyr182), which is mediated by upstream MAP kinase kinases such as MKK3, MKK4, and MKK6. This phosphorylation induces a conformational rearrangement in the activation loop, switching the kinase from an inactive to an active state (moralesmartinez2024p38mapkmolecular pages 4-6, moralesmartinez2024p38moleculartargeting pages 22-23). Post-translational regulation further includes interactions with regulatory proteins such as histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), which has been reported to modulate MAPK11 activity by repressing the activity of downstream transcription factors like ATF2. MAPK11 is also subject to regulation by non-coding RNAs, with microRNAs such as hsa-miR-122-5p, hsa-miR-124-3p, and hsa-let-7a-5p predicted to target its mRNA and thereby impact its expression levels (moralesmartinez2024p38mapkmolecular pages 7-8). In addition, alternative splicing of the MAPK11 transcript produces two isoforms: the canonical 364–amino acid protein (Q15759-1) and a shorter variant (Q15759-3), which may contribute to differential regulation in various tissue contexts (moralesmartinez2024p38mapkmolecular pages 4-6).\n\n7. Function – MAPK11 functions as a serine/threonine kinase that plays a central role in the MAPK signal transduction pathway activated in response to extracellular stress stimuli. It phosphorylates a broad range of substrates—including transcription factors (such as ATF1, ATF2, ELK1, and MEF2), downstream kinases (including RPS6KA5/MSK1 and RPS6KA4/MSK2), and components involved in post-transcriptional regulation (such as MAPKAPK2/MK2 and MAPKAPK3/MK3)—thereby modulating gene expression, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and metabolic processes (moralesmartinez2024p38mapkmolecular pages 4-6, moralesmartinez2024p38moleculartargeting pages 23-24). In the nucleus, MAPK11 influences the phosphorylation and activation of transcription factors that regulate immediate-early gene induction in response to stress, while in the cytoplasm, it can impact the turnover and ectodomain shedding of transmembrane proteins such as ADAM17, further linking its activity to inflammatory signaling pathways (moralesmartinez2024p38moleculartargeting pages 23-24). Although MAPK11’s functions are largely redundant with those of the closely related p38α, its expression pattern – which shows relative enrichment in brain tissue and a different regulatory pattern compared with p38α – suggests that it may have specialized roles in certain cellular contexts (moralesmartinez2024p38mapkmolecular pages 2-4, moralesmartinez2024p38moleculartargeting pages 7-8).\n\n8. Other Comments – Several small-molecule inhibitors that target the ATP-binding pocket of the p38 MAPK family have been developed and tested in both preclinical and clinical settings, including compounds such as SB203580, VX-745, SCIO-469, BIRB-796, LY2228820 and SD-169 (moralesmartinez2024p38moleculartargeting pages 8-10, moralesmartinez2024p38moleculartargeting pages 23-24). These inhibitors typically exhibit activity against both p38α and p38β isoforms, although differences in inhibitor sensitivity due to structural nuances in the ATP-binding site have been observed (patel2009thethreedimensionalstructure pages 1-2, yurtsever2015thecrystalstructure pages 5-7). MAPK11 has been implicated in various inflammatory disorders and cancers, including multiple myeloma, where its activation contributes to pathways promoting cell survival, proliferation, chemoresistance, and osteolytic bone disease (moralesmartinez2024p38moleculartargeting pages 23-24, moralesmartinez2024p38mapkmolecular pages 14-16). This association has spurred significant interest in targeting MAPK11 as part of next-generation therapies for hematological malignancies and other stress-related pathologies (moralesmartinez2024p38moleculartargeting pages 14-16). Moreover, emerging data suggest that post-transcriptional regulation by non-coding RNAs may also offer additional avenues for therapeutic intervention by modulating MAPK11 expression levels (moralesmartinez2024p38mapkmolecular pages 7-8).\n\n9.

MAPK12 is one of the four p38 MAPKs which play an important role in the cascades of cellular responses evoked by extracellular stimuli such as pro-inflammatory cytokines or physical stress leading to direct activation of transcription factors such as ELK1 and ATF2. Accordingly, p38 MAPKs phosphorylate a broad range of proteins and it has been estimated that they may have approximately 200 to 300 substrates each. Some of the targets are downstream kinases such as MAPKAPK2, which are activated through phosphorylation and further phosphorylate additional targets. Plays a role in myoblast differentiation and also in the down-regulation of cyclin D1 in response to hypoxia in adrenal cells suggesting MAPK12 may inhibit cell proliferation while promoting differentiation. Phosphorylates DLG1. Following osmotic shock, MAPK12 in the cell nucleus increases its association with nuclear DLG1, thereby causing dissociation of DLG1-SFPQ complexes. This function is independent of its catalytic activity and could affect mRNA processing and/or gene transcription to aid cell adaptation to osmolarity changes in the environment. Regulates UV-induced checkpoint signaling and repair of UV-induced DNA damage and G2 arrest after gamma-radiation exposure. MAPK12 is involved in the regulation of SLC2A1 expression and basal glucose uptake in L6 myotubes; and negatively regulates SLC2A4 expression and contraction-mediated glucose uptake in adult skeletal muscle. C-Jun (JUN) phosphorylation is stimulated by MAPK14 and inhibited by MAPK12, leading to a distinct AP-1 regulation. MAPK12 is required for the normal kinetochore localization of PLK1, prevents chromosomal instability and supports mitotic cell viability. MAPK12-signaling is also positively regulating the expansion of transient amplifying myogenic precursor cells during muscle growth and regeneration**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nMAPK12, commonly referred to as p38γ, is a member of the p38 mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, which comprises four isoforms: p38α, p38β, p38γ, and p38δ. MAPK12/p38γ shares approximately 62% amino acid identity with p38α, and its evolutionary conservation across metazoans places it within the stress‐activated protein kinase subgroup of the kinome (moralesmartinez2024p38moleculartargeting pages 2-4). Orthologs of p38γ have been identified in a diverse range of species including mammals, with a particularly enriched expression in tissues such as skeletal muscle and heart, which underscores its conserved yet specialized biological functions (escos2016p38γandp38δ pages 1-2, han2020anoverviewof pages 3-5). Phylogenetic analyses based on the core kinase domain indicate that p38γ clusters with p38δ as alternative p38 isoforms that differ from the ubiquitously expressed p38α and p38β; this grouping is consistent with its unique regulatory and substrate interaction features that have diverged from more canonical MAPK family members (moralesmartinez2024p38mapkmolecular pages 2-4, han2020anoverviewof pages 1-3).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nMAPK12 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to protein substrates. The canonical chemical reaction is represented as: ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺. This serine/threonine phosphorylation reaction underlies its role as an essential mediator of intracellular signal transduction (moralesmartinez2024p38moleculartargeting pages 1-2, han2020anoverviewof pages 1-3).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of MAPK12 is dependent on ATP as the phosphate donor and requires divalent cations, most notably Mg²⁺, to facilitate the phosphorylation reaction. Such cofactor dependency is characteristic of serine/threonine kinases and supports proper positioning of ATP within the catalytic cleft during the phosphoryl transfer (gold2010aptamerbasedmultiplexedproteomic pages 64-65).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nMAPK12/p38γ exhibits substrate specificity that aligns with the general consensus of MAPK family substrate motifs. The kinase preferentially phosphorylates serine or threonine residues that are immediately followed by a proline; that is, it targets [S/T]P motifs. In addition to this minimal consensus, substrate recognition may be further influenced by the presence of adjacent basic or acidic residues and by docking motifs within the substrate proteins, which mediate high-affinity interactions with the kinase’s docking groove (prat2018molecularbasisof pages 24-25, han2020anoverviewof pages 1-3). Importantly, p38γ also possesses a unique short C-terminal PDZ-binding motif that directs its interaction with PDZ domain-containing proteins, thereby extending its substrate repertoire to include specific scaffold proteins such as DLG1 and others involved in cytoskeletal organization (escos2016p38γandp38δ pages 1-2, qi2023p38γmapkinflammatory pages 3-5).\n\n5. Structure  \nMAPK12/p38γ is organized around a conserved central kinase domain that spans approximately residues 27 to 311. This domain encompasses the ATP-binding sites, identified in the region of residues 33–41 and near residue 56, and includes a key catalytic residue at position 153. A defining structural element of this kinase is the dual phosphorylation TXY motif (threonine–glycine–tyrosine) located between residues 183 and 185; phosphorylation of these residues is essential for transitioning the kinase from an inactive to an active state (moralesmartinez2024p38mapkmolecular pages 4-6, moralesmartinez2024p38moleculartargeting pages 1-2). Structural studies using X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy have revealed that p38γ exists in multiple conformational states. In the inactive apo form, distinct open and compact conformations have been characterized, with the compact state displaying reorientation of the αC helix and a stabilizing Lys56/Glu74 salt bridge reminiscent of the active state, although full catalytic activity is achieved only upon phosphorylation. The dynamic equilibrium between the open inactive and the compact active-like states is mediated by conformational changes in key elements such as the DFG loop and the activation loop, as well as subtle repositioning of residues such as Met112 in the hinge region, which collectively modulate ATP binding affinity and accessibility of the substrate-binding site (aoto2019adynamicswitch pages 32-37, aoto2019adynamicswitch pages 11-16). In addition, p38γ harbors a C-terminal PDZ-binding motif that facilitates selective interactions with scaffolding proteins harboring PDZ domains, representing a unique structural feature that distinguishes it from other MAPK isoforms (escos2016p38γandp38δ pages 1-2).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulatory mechanisms governing MAPK12 involve multiple layers of control. Primary activation occurs via dual phosphorylation of the TXY motif by upstream MAP kinase kinases (MKKs), predominantly MKK3 and MKK6, which induce a conformational shift from an inactive to an active kinase state (moralesmartinez2024p38mapkmolecular pages 1-2, aoto2019adynamicswitch pages 6-11). Additional post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination, contribute to the regulation of p38γ stability and degradation, while acetylation within the ATP-binding pocket has also been implicated in modulating its enzymatic activity. Structural dynamics, characterized by NMR relaxation dispersion experiments, underscore the intrinsic flexibility of the activation and DFG loops, which play crucial roles in the allosteric regulation of kinase activity (aoto2019adynamicswitch pages 21-26, aoto2019adynamicswitch pages 42-46). Furthermore, the unique PDZ-binding motif of p38γ mediates its association with specific scaffolds and regulatory proteins, thereby influencing substrate interactions and downstream signaling without necessarily altering its catalytic activity. This regulation through PDZ-dependent binding is particularly relevant in the context of osmotic shock, where nuclear relocalization of p38γ and increased association with nuclear DLG1 leads to modulation of protein complexes involved in mRNA processing and gene transcription (qi2023p38γmapkinflammatory pages 11-12, riesgo2012newinsightsinto pages 2-4).\n\n7. Function  \nMAPK12 functions as a serine/threonine kinase within the p38 MAPK signaling cascade and plays a critical role in the cellular response to stress stimuli, including pro-inflammatory cytokines, UV radiation, and osmotic shock. By phosphorylating a diverse array of substrates—estimated to number between 200 and 300—the kinase modulates pathways related to cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and metabolic regulation (moralesmartinez2024p38mapkmolecular pages 1-2, han2020anoverviewof pages 3-5). In muscle tissue, p38γ is preferentially expressed and contributes to myoblast differentiation and the expansion of transient amplifying myogenic precursor cells during muscle growth and regeneration (moralesmartinez2024p38mapkmolecular pages 2-4, moralesmartinez2024p38moleculartargeting pages 2-4). In response to external stresses, such as osmotic changes, p38γ increases its nuclear association with DLG1, thereby affecting the dissociation of nuclear complexes involved in mRNA processing and transcription (moralesmartinez2024p38mapkmolecular pages 20-22, riesgo2012newinsightsinto pages 2-4). Additionally, p38γ is implicated in the regulation of key signaling pathways such as those governing UV-induced checkpoint control and the repair of DNA damage, as well as in mediating metabolic responses such as the regulation of glucose transporter expression and basal glucose uptake in muscle cells (moralesmartinez2024p38mapkmolecular pages 1-2, qi2023p38γmapkinflammatory pages 5-7). Its role in modulating the phosphorylation state of transcription factors, such as ELK1, ATF2, and c-Jun—with p38γ exhibiting an antagonistic effect on c-Jun phosphorylation compared to p38α—further exemplifies its importance in determining the cellular outcome following stress signal transduction (moralesmartinez2024p38mapkmolecular pages 20-22, han2020anoverviewof pages 3-5). MAPK12 also participates in proper mitotic progression by ensuring the correct kinetochore localization of PLK1, thereby preventing chromosomal instability and supporting mitotic cell viability (moralesmartinez2024p38mapkmolecular pages 2-4).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nAmong the various chemical inhibitors developed to target the p38 MAPK family, many show selective activity against p38α and p38β isoforms; for instance, SB203580 is known to inhibit these isoforms but has little to no effect on p38γ and p38δ (wei2020effectofacupuncture pages 4-6, williams2017emergingrolesof pages 18-22). Several inhibitor compounds such as VX-745, SCIO-469, and nucleoside analogs like 8-NH₂-Ado have been evaluated in preclinical studies, although specific inhibitors that directly and selectively target MAPK12/p38γ remain limited (moralesmartinez2024p38moleculartargeting pages 8-10, machado2021thep38mapk pages 1-2). In addition to small-molecule inhibitors, bioinformatic analysis using TargetScan has identified conserved microRNA binding sites for hsa-miR-125a-5p, hsa-miR-125b-5p, and hsa-miR-4319 in the MAPK12 gene, suggesting a regulatory layer via miRNAs that influences its expression and activity in tumorigenic contexts (moralesmartinez2024p38moleculartargeting pages 8-10). The involvement of MAPK12 in various disease processes is underscored by its role in mediating cellular stress responses, its altered expression profiles in several cancers—including breast cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, and glioblastoma—and its contributory effects on chemoresistance in multiple myeloma (moralesmartinez2024p38mapkmolecular pages 20-22, moralesmartinez2024p38moleculartargeting pages 14-16). No notable disease mutations specific to MAPK12 have been detailed in the available context; however, its participation in checkpoint signaling and downstream transcriptional regulation indicates that dysregulation of p38γ can have significant cellular consequences.\n\n9.

MAPK13 is one of the four p38 MAPKs which play an important role in the cascades of cellular responses evoked by extracellular stimuli such as pro-inflammatory cytokines or physical stress leading to direct activation of transcription factors such as ELK1 and ATF2. Accordingly, p38 MAPKs phosphorylate a broad range of proteins and it has been estimated that they may have approximately 200 to 300 substrates each. MAPK13 is one of the less studied p38 MAPK isoforms. Some of the targets are downstream kinases such as MAPKAPK2, which are activated through phosphorylation and further phosphorylate additional targets. Plays a role in the regulation of protein translation by phosphorylating and inactivating EEF2K. Involved in cytoskeletal remodeling through phosphorylation of MAPT and STMN1. Mediates UV irradiation induced up-regulation of the gene expression of CXCL14. Plays an important role in the regulation of epidermal keratinocyte differentiation, apoptosis and skin tumor development. Phosphorylates the transcriptional activator MYB in response to stress which leads to rapid MYB degradation via a proteasome-dependent pathway. MAPK13 also phosphorylates and down-regulates PRKD1 during regulation of insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nMitogen-activated protein kinase 13 (MAPK13), also known as p38δ or SAPK4, is a member of the p38 mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) family that is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals and is classified within the stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) subgroup alongside p38α, p38β, and p38γ (cerezoguisado2011mapk13(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2, kultz1998phylogeneticandfunctional pages 1-2). MAPK13 is present in all mammalian species and has orthologs in vertebrates that share the characteristic serine/threonine kinase domain and the conserved dual phosphorylation motif required for activation (goedert1997activationofthe pages 5-6, kultz1998phylogeneticandfunctional pages 2-3). Within the human kinome, MAPK13 is phylogenetically grouped with other members of the p38 subfamily, whose evolutionary divergence has provided distinctive functional specializations in response to cellular stresses such as cytokine exposure and physical stress (cerezoguisado2011mapk13(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2, kultz1998phylogeneticandfunctional pages 1-2). Members of the p38 MAPK family diverged through gene duplication events that allowed for the emergence of isoforms with overlapping yet distinct substrate specificities and regulatory behaviors (kultz1998phylogeneticandfunctional pages 17-18).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nMAPK13 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins, resulting in the formation of ADP and a phosphorylated protein, with the concomitant release of a proton (cerezoguisado2011mapk13(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2, kyriakis1996proteinkinasecascades pages 3-4). This phosphorylation reaction is critical for modulating downstream signaling pathways and altering the functional state of numerous target proteins, thereby regulating a wide range of physiological cellular responses (zarubin2005activationandsignaling pages 2-3).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of MAPK13 is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions, with Mg²⁺ serving as an essential cofactor to facilitate ATP binding and phosphate transfer (cerezoguisado2011mapk13(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2, zarubin2005activationandsignaling pages 2-3).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nMAPK13 exhibits substrate specificity characteristic of serine/threonine kinases, preferentially phosphorylating residues within a proline-directed motif, typically recognizing substrates that conform to a consensus sequence in which the phosphorylated serine or threonine is immediately followed by a proline residue (cerezoguisado2011mapk13(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2, roux2004erkandp38 pages 2-3). In vitro studies have demonstrated that MAPK13 phosphorylates key transcription factors such as ATF2 and ELK1, as well as downstream kinases like MAPKAPK2, which are further involved in amplifying the kinase cascade (goedert1997activationofthe pages 5-6, zarubin2005activationandsignaling pages 3-5). Additionally, MAPK13 targets proteins involved in cytoskeletal remodeling such as the microtubule-associated protein Tau (MAPT) and stathmin (STMN1), and it phosphorylates the elongation factor eEF2 kinase, thereby affecting translation regulation (cerezoguisado2011mapk13(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 2-3, tibbles1999thestressactivatedprotein pages 1-3).\n\n5. Structure  \nMAPK13 is a 365-amino acid protein with an approximate molecular weight of 40 kDa that contains a central kinase domain organized into the typical N-terminal lobe (mainly β-strands) and C-terminal lobe (primarily α-helices) common to protein kinases (cerezoguisado2011mapk13(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2, goedert1997activationofthe pages 5-6). The kinase domain is flanked by relatively short N-terminal and C-terminal regions that may contain sequences involved in subcellular localization and protein–protein interactions; however, unlike some kinases, MAPK13 does not have extensive regulatory extensions (cerezoguisado2011mapk13(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 3-4, kultz1998phylogeneticandfunctional pages 14-15). A key structural feature is the activation loop which harbors the conserved Thr-Gly-Tyr (TGY) motif, where dual phosphorylation of Thr180 and Tyr182 by MAP kinase kinases such as MKK3 or MKK6 is required for full activation of MAPK13 (cerezoguisado2011mapk13(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2, goedert1997activationofthe pages 5-6). The structural organization includes typical protein kinase subdomains I–XI, and, while MAPK13 shares about 60% identity with other p38 isoforms (notably p38α and p38β), it displays unique features regarding inhibitor sensitivity and substrate binding that set it apart from its paralogs (cerezoguisado2011mapk13(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2, zarubin2005activationandsignaling pages 6-7). In crystallographic studies and AlphaFold-based models, MAPK13 has been predicted to preserve the conserved catalytic core with a prominent ATP-binding pocket that governs its interaction with ATP and small molecule inhibitors (roux2004erkandp38 pages 3-4).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of MAPK13 is chiefly achieved via dual phosphorylation of its TGY activation loop by upstream kinases, primarily MKK3 and MKK6; in many cellular contexts, there is preferential activation by MKK3, although MKK6 can phosphorylate MAPK13 under certain conditions (goedert1997activationofthe pages 5-6, zarubin2005activationandsignaling pages 5-6). Upon phosphorylation, MAPK13 undergoes a conformational change that facilitates its binding to substrates; this phosphorylation-dependent switching is a common regulatory mechanism among MAPKs (cerezoguisado2011mapk13(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2, kyriakis1996proteinkinasecascades pages 3-4). MAPK13 is also regulated by upstream extracellular stimuli including pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-α, as well as by physical stress signals such as UV irradiation, which collectively lead to its activation in numerous stress response pathways (cerezoguisado2011mapk13(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 3-4, sugden1998“stressresponsive”mitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2). In contrast to other p38 isoforms, MAPK13 shows reduced sensitivity to classical pyridinyl imidazole inhibitors like SB203580, highlighting distinct conformational and regulatory features that may reflect subtle differences in its ATP-binding pocket and regulatory interfaces (goedert1997activationofthe pages 6-8, zarubin2005activationandsignaling pages 6-7).\n\n7. Function  \nMAPK13 serves as an essential serine/threonine kinase in the MAPK signal transduction pathway and is pivotal in mediating cellular responses to extracellular stresses (cerezoguisado2011mapk13(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2, zarubin2005activationandsignaling pages 2-3). It phosphorylates an extensive range of substrates—estimated at roughly 200 to 300—including transcription factors such as ELK1 and ATF2 that direct immediate early gene expression in response to stress (cerezoguisado2011mapk13(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2, dodeller2006thep38mitogenactivated pages 10-11). MAPK13 also phosphorylates downstream kinases like MAPKAPK2, which further amplifies the cellular stress response by targeting proteins involved in inflammation and cytoskeletal organization (goedert1997activationofthe pages 5-6, roux2004erkandp38 pages 2-3). In addition, MAPK13 regulates protein synthesis by phosphorylating and inactivating the eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (EEF2K), thereby promoting translation under certain conditions (cerezoguisado2011mapk13(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 2-3, zarubin2005activationandsignaling pages 3-5). Beyond its role in translation, MAPK13 participates in cytoskeletal remodeling via phosphorylation of microtubule-associated proteins such as Tau (MAPT) and stathmin (STMN1), facilitating dynamic cellular rearrangements in processes like cell migration and differentiation (cerezoguisado2011mapk13(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 3-4, tibbles1999thestressactivatedprotein pages 1-3). In epidermal cells, MAPK13 is implicated in keratinocyte differentiation and apoptosis, with its activity linked to the regulation of the involucrin promoter and complex formation with ERK1/2, thereby influencing skin tumor development (cerezoguisado2011mapk13(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 3-4, dodeller2006thep38mitogenactivated pages 2-3). Moreover, MAPK13 phosphorylates the transcriptional activator MYB in response to cellular stress, which results in rapid proteasome-dependent degradation of MYB and thus modulates gene expression patterns required for stress adaptation (cerezoguisado2011mapk13(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 3-4, goedert1997activationofthe pages 9-9). In pancreatic beta cells, the kinase down-regulates protein kinase D1 (PRKD1) via phosphorylation, an event that is significant in the regulation of insulin secretion (cerezoguisado2011mapk13(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 3-4, zarubin2005activationandsignaling pages 6-7).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nMAPK13 is classified as one of the less well-studied isoforms of the p38 MAPK family, and its unique biochemical and regulatory characteristics render it a promising candidate for the development of tailored therapeutic agents (cerezoguisado2011mapk13(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2, dodeller2006thep38mitogenactivated pages 10-11). Notably, the kinase displays differential sensitivity to small molecule inhibitors when compared to other p38 isoforms, as exemplified by its relative insensitivity to inhibitors such as SB203580 that effectively target p38α and p38β (goedert1997activationofthe pages 6-8, zarubin2005activationandsignaling pages 6-7). MAPK13 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including skin tumorigenesis, cholangiocarcinoma where its overexpression can serve as a diagnostic marker, and alterations in its epigenetic profiles have been associated with malignant pleural mesothelioma (cerezoguisado2011mapk13(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 3-4, dodeller2006thep38mitogenactivated pages 2-3). Its involvement in the regulation of the insulin secretion pathway further highlights its potential contributions to metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes (cerezoguisado2011mapk13(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 3-4, zarubin2005activationandsignaling pages 6-7).\n\n9.

MAPK14 is one of the four p38 MAPKs which play an important role in the cascades of cellular responses evoked by extracellular stimuli such as pro-inflammatory cytokines or physical stress leading to direct activation of transcription factors. Accordingly, p38 MAPKs phosphorylate a broad range of proteins and it has been estimated that they may have approximately 200 to 300 substrates each. Some of the targets are downstream kinases which are activated through phosphorylation and further phosphorylate additional targets. RPS6KA5/MSK1 and RPS6KA4/MSK2 can directly phosphorylate and activate transcription factors such as CREB1, ATF1, the NF-kappa-B isoform RELA/NFKB3, STAT1 and STAT3, but can also phosphorylate histone H3 and the nucleosomal protein HMGN1 (PubMed:9687510, PubMed:9792677). RPS6KA5/MSK1 and RPS6KA4/MSK2 play important roles in the rapid induction of immediate-early genes in response to stress or mitogenic stimuli, either by inducing chromatin remodeling or by recruiting the transcription machinery (PubMed:9687510, PubMed:9792677). On the other hand, two other kinase targets, MAPKAPK2/MK2 and MAPKAPK3/MK3, participate in the control of gene expression mostly at the post-transcriptional level, by phosphorylating ZFP36 (tristetraprolin) and ELAVL1, and by regulating EEF2K, which is important for the elongation of mRNA during translation. MKNK1/MNK1 and MKNK2/MNK2, two other kinases activated by p38 MAPKs, regulate protein synthesis by phosphorylating the initiation factor EIF4E2 (PubMed:11154262). MAPK14 also interacts with casein kinase II, leading to its activation through autophosphorylation and further phosphorylation of TP53/p53 (PubMed:10747897). In the cytoplasm, the p38 MAPK pathway is an important regulator of protein turnover. For example, CFLAR is an inhibitor of TNF-induced apoptosis whose proteasome-mediated degradation is regulated by p38 MAPK phosphorylation. In a similar way, MAPK14 phosphorylates the ubiquitin ligase SIAH2, regulating its activity towards EGLN3 (PubMed:17003045). MAPK14 may also inhibit the lysosomal degradation pathway of autophagy by interfering with the intracellular trafficking of the transmembrane protein ATG9 (PubMed:19893488). Another function of MAPK14 is to regulate the endocytosis of membrane receptors by different mechanisms that impinge on the small GTPase RAB5A. In addition, clathrin-mediated EGFR internalization induced by inflammatory cytokines and UV irradiation depends on MAPK14-mediated phosphorylation of EGFR itself as well as of RAB5A effectors (PubMed:16932740). Ectodomain shedding of transmembrane proteins is regulated by p38 MAPKs as well. In response to inflammatory stimuli, p38 MAPKs phosphorylate the membrane-associated metalloprotease ADAM17 (PubMed:20188673). Such phosphorylation is required for ADAM17-mediated ectodomain shedding of TGF-alpha family ligands, which results in the activation of EGFR signaling and cell proliferation. Another p38 MAPK substrate is FGFR1. FGFR1 can be translocated from the extracellular space into the cytosol and nucleus of target cells, and regulates processes such as rRNA synthesis and cell growth. FGFR1 translocation requires p38 MAPK activation. In the nucleus, many transcription factors are phosphorylated and activated by p38 MAPKs in response to different stimuli. Classical examples include ATF1, ATF2, ATF6, ELK1, PTPRH, DDIT3, TP53/p53 and MEF2C and MEF2A (PubMed:10330143, PubMed:9430721, PubMed:9858528). The p38 MAPKs are emerging as important modulators of gene expression by regulating chromatin modifiers and remodelers. The promoters of several genes involved in the inflammatory response, such as IL6, IL8 and IL12B, display a p38 MAPK-dependent enrichment of histone H3 phosphorylation on 'Ser-10' (H3S10ph) in LPS-stimulated myeloid cells. This phosphorylation enhances the accessibility of the cryptic NF-kappa-B-binding sites marking promoters for increased NF-kappa-B recruitment. Phosphorylates CDC25B and CDC25C which is required for binding to 14-3-3 proteins and leads to initiation of a G2 delay after ultraviolet radiation (PubMed:11333986). Phosphorylates TIAR following DNA damage, releasing TIAR from GADD45A mRNA and preventing mRNA degradation (PubMed:20932473). The p38 MAPKs may also have kinase-independent roles, which are thought to be due to the binding to targets in the absence of phosphorylation. Protein O-Glc-N-acylation catalyzed by the OGT is regulated by MAPK14, and, although OGT does not seem to be phosphorylated by MAPK14, their interaction increases upon MAPK14 activation induced by glucose deprivation. This interaction may regulate OGT activity by recruiting it to specific targets such as neurofilament H, stimulating its O-Glc-N-acylation. Required in mid-fetal development for the growth of embryo-derived blood vessels in the labyrinth layer of the placenta. Also plays an essential role in developmental and stress-induced erythropoiesis, through regulation of EPO gene expression (PubMed:10943842). Isoform MXI2 activation is stimulated by mitogens and oxidative stress and only poorly phosphorylates ELK1 and ATF2. Isoform EXIP may play a role in the early onset of apoptosis. Phosphorylates S100A9 at 'Thr-113' (PubMed:15905572). Phosphorylates NLRP1 downstream of MAP3K20/ZAK in response to UV-B irradiation and ribosome collisions, promoting activation of the NLRP1 inflammasome and pyroptosis (PubMed:35857590)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nMAPK14, commonly referred to as p38α, is a member of the p38 mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, which comprises four isoforms (p38α, p38β, p38γ, and p38δ) present in higher eukaryotes. p38α is the most extensively studied and is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues. It is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to man, representing the ortholog of the yeast Hog1 kinase that is activated in response to hyperosmotic stress. This conservation is reflected in the shared architecture and activation mechanisms between p38α and its yeast counterpart. Within the broader kinome, p38α is classified under the stress‐activated MAPK group, and its molecular lineage can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes alongside other MAP kinases involved in stress and immune signaling (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 4-5, cuenda2007p38mapkinasespathway pages 1-2, martinblanco2000p38mapksignalling pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nMAPK14 catalyzes the transfer of the γ‐phosphate group from ATP to hydroxyl groups on serine and/or threonine residues of substrate proteins. The general chemical reaction can be represented as: ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺. This phosphorylation event is central to the propagation of intracellular signaling, as the addition of a phosphate moiety triggers conformational changes in substrates that affect their activity, interactions, and cellular localization (cuenda2007p38mapkinasespathway pages 1-2, kyriakis2012mammalianmapksignal pages 3-5).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of MAPK14 is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ion cofactors, most notably Mg²⁺, which is required for the proper binding and orientation of ATP in the active site. In some in vitro scenarios, Mn²⁺ may substitute for Mg²⁺ to support kinase activity, although Mg²⁺ is generally considered the physiological cofactor in cells. This requirement ensures proper positioning of ATP for the subsequent phosphoryl transfer reaction (cuenda2007p38mapkinasespathway pages 1-2, lin2007novelstrategiesfor pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nMAPK14 exhibits broad substrate specificity and phosphorylates an extensive array of proteins, with estimates ranging from approximately 200 to 300 distinct substrates. The kinase displays a preference for serine/threonine residues that are followed by a proline, constituting a minimal consensus motif denoted as S/T-P. In addition to the minimal motif, substrate recognition by p38α is frequently enhanced by specific docking domains and sequences—such as D domains and DEF motifs—that facilitate stable and selective interactions between the kinase and its substrates. Examples of well‐characterized substrates include downstream kinases like MAPK-activated protein kinase-2 (MK2), transcription factors including ATF1/2/6 and MEF2 family members, and proteins involved in chromatin remodeling. This broad specificity is a key factor enabling p38α to integrate and coordinate diverse cellular responses, especially under stress and inflammatory conditions (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 4-5, cuenda2007p38mapkinasespathway pages 1-2, yong2009thep38mapk pages 1-2).\n\n5. Structure  \nThe three-dimensional organization of MAPK14 is typical of classical serine/threonine protein kinases, and its overall architecture is divided into a smaller N-terminal lobe and a larger C-terminal lobe that together form a catalytic cleft. The enzyme harbors a central kinase domain that includes several key structural features:  \n• The N-terminal lobe is primarily composed of β-sheets and a conserved C-helix, which plays an important role in ATP binding and positioning.  \n• The C-terminal lobe is predominantly α-helical and contains the activation loop, which encompasses the conserved Thr-Gly-Tyr (TGY) motif essential for kinase activation. Dual phosphorylation of this motif triggers a conformational change that aligns the catalytic residues and activates the kinase.  \n• A unique nuclear translocation sequence is present within the kinase insert domain, facilitating the import of p38α into the nucleus upon activation.  \n• Structural studies and crystallographic analyses reveal the presence of an ATP binding pocket defined by a set of conserved residues, including those that participate in the formation of a hydrophobic spine and contribute to the enzyme’s catalytic efficiency. These features enable selective binding of ATP-competitive inhibitors, such as the pyridinyl imidazole class (SB203580, SB202190) and the allosteric inhibitor BIRB0796 (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 4-5, cuenda2007p38mapkinasespathway pages 12-13, cuadrado2010mechanismsandfunctions pages 1-1, ono2000thep38signal pages 1-2).\n\n6. Regulation  \nMAPK14 is tightly regulated through multiple mechanisms to ensure precise control over its activity in response to extracellular and intracellular stimuli. The primary regulatory mechanism involves the dual phosphorylation of the TGY motif within the activation loop by upstream dual-specificity MAP kinase kinases (MAP2Ks), particularly MKK3 and MKK6. This phosphorylation is essential for the full catalytic activation of p38α. In addition to the canonical MAP2K-mediated activation, non-canonical pathways exist:  \n• In T lymphocytes, p38α can be activated by tyrosine phosphorylation at residue Y323, leading to subsequent autophosphorylation—this mechanism is particularly relevant during T-cell receptor signaling.  \n• The adaptor protein TAB1 (TAK1-binding protein 1) can directly interact with and induce autophosphorylation of p38α, contributing to its activation independently of MAP2Ks.  \nBeyond phosphorylation, p38α activity is subject to negative regulation by protein phosphatases, including various MAP kinase phosphatases (MKPs), which dephosphorylate its activation loop, thereby attenuating the signal. Additionally, conformational regulation and interactions with scaffold proteins help localize p38α to specific subcellular compartments and promote selective substrate phosphorylation. Such spatial organization ensures responsiveness to diverse stimuli such as oxidative stress, ultraviolet irradiation, hypoxia, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (cuenda2007p38mapkinasespathway pages 12-13, lin2007novelstrategiesfor pages 5-6, marber2011thep38mitogenactivated pages 1-2, schindler2007p38pathwaykinases pages 2-4).\n\n7. Function  \nMAPK14 plays a central role in mediating cellular responses to a variety of stress stimuli and pro-inflammatory signals. As a serine/threonine kinase, it modulates the activity of numerous downstream targets, thereby orchestrating a wide spectrum of biological processes.  \nIn the cytoplasm, p38α regulates several critical functions such as:  \n• Inflammatory responses by controlling the transcription and stability of cytokine mRNAs. It phosphorylates substrates like MK2 and MK3, which in turn regulate the post-transcriptional processing of inflammatory mediators including TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8.  \n• Protein turnover and receptor internalization through phosphorylation of proteins involved in endocytic pathways and the regulation of ubiquitin ligase activity. For instance, p38α phosphorylates the ubiquitin ligase SIAH2, thereby modulating its activity toward substrates such as EGLN3, and it phosphorylates components of clathrin-mediated endocytosis involved in EGFR internalization.  \nIn the nucleus, p38α phosphorylates a range of transcription factors—such as ATF1, ATF2, ATF6, ELK1, and p53—leading to alterations in gene expression that are critical for stress-induced gene activation, cell cycle arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis. Furthermore, p38α modulates chromatin accessibility by phosphorylating histones and chromatin remodelers, which facilitates the recruitment of the transcription machinery to promoters of immediate-early genes, a process that is particularly important for the inflammatory response.  \nExpressed ubiquitously, MAPK14 is hence involved in numerous physiological and stress-induced processes, including the regulation of immune responses, cell survival, and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis under conditions of injury or environmental stress (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 4-5, cuenda2007p38mapkinasespathway pages 1-2, maikrachline2020nuclearp38roles pages 14-16, schindler2007p38pathwaykinases pages 11-12).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nA number of small-molecule inhibitors have been developed to target p38α due to its pivotal role in inflammatory signaling and various pathological conditions. Early inhibitors from the pyridinyl imidazole class, such as SB203580 and SB202190, competitively inhibit ATP binding to p38α and have been widely used in cellular and animal model studies. More recent inhibitors like BIRB0796 target p38α through alternative mechanisms that induce conformational changes independent of directly competing with ATP, thereby offering improved potency and isoform specificity. MAPK14 is associated with several disease states, including chronic inflammatory disorders, autoimmune conditions, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer, underscoring the therapeutic interest in modulating its activity. In addition to its kinase-dependent functions, emerging evidence suggests that p38α may also have kinase-independent roles mediated by protein–protein interactions that can affect functions such as protein O-GlcNAcylation and subcellular trafficking. These multifaceted roles of MAPK14 continue to drive research into its regulatory mechanisms and the development of more effective and selective inhibitors (lin2007novelstrategiesfor pages 1-2, marber2011thep38mitogenactivated pages 1-2, schindler2007p38pathwaykinases pages 5-6, yong2009thep38mapk pages 8-9).\n\n9.

In response to reduction of intracellular ATP levels, AMPK activates energy-producing pathways and inhibits energy-consuming processes: inhibits protein, carbohydrate and lipid biosynthesis, as well as cell growth and proliferation (PubMed:17307971, PubMed:17712357). AMPK acts via direct phosphorylation of metabolic enzymes, and by longer-term effects via phosphorylation of transcription regulators (PubMed:17307971, PubMed:17712357). Regulates lipid synthesis by phosphorylating and inactivating lipid metabolic enzymes such as ACACA, ACACB, GYS1, HMGCR and LIPE; regulates fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis by phosphorylating acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACACA and ACACB) and hormone-sensitive lipase (LIPE) enzymes, respectively (PubMed:7959015). Promotes lipolysis of lipid droplets by mediating phosphorylation of isoform 1 of CHKA (CHKalpha2) (PubMed:34077757). Regulates insulin-signaling and glycolysis by phosphorylating IRS1, PFKFB2 and PFKFB3 (By similarity). Involved in insulin receptor/INSR internalization (PubMed:25687571). AMPK stimulates glucose uptake in muscle by increasing the translocation of the glucose transporter SLC2A4/GLUT4 to the plasma membrane, possibly by mediating phosphorylation of TBC1D4/AS160 (By similarity). Regulates transcription and chromatin structure by phosphorylating transcription regulators involved in energy metabolism such as CRTC2/TORC2, FOXO3, histone H2B, HDAC5, MEF2C, MLXIPL/ChREBP, EP300, HNF4A, p53/TP53, SREBF1, SREBF2 and PPARGC1A (PubMed:11518699, PubMed:11554766, PubMed:15866171, PubMed:17711846, PubMed:18184930). Acts as a key regulator of glucose homeostasis in liver by phosphorylating CRTC2/TORC2, leading to CRTC2/TORC2 sequestration in the cytoplasm (By similarity). In response to stress, phosphorylates 'Ser-36' of histone H2B (H2BS36ph), leading to promote transcription (By similarity). Acts as a key regulator of cell growth and proliferation by phosphorylating FNIP1, TSC2, RPTOR, WDR24 and ATG1/ULK1: in response to nutrient limitation, negatively regulates the mTORC1 complex by phosphorylating RPTOR component of the mTORC1 complex and by phosphorylating and activating TSC2 (PubMed:14651849, PubMed:20160076, PubMed:21205641). Also phosphorylates and inhibits GATOR2 subunit WDR24 in response to nutrient limitation, leading to suppress glucose-mediated mTORC1 activation (PubMed:36732624). In response to energetic stress, phosphorylates FNIP1, inactivating the non-canonical mTORC1 signaling, thereby promoting nuclear translocation of TFEB and TFE3, and inducing transcription of lysosomal or autophagy genes (PubMed:37079666). In response to nutrient limitation, promotes autophagy by phosphorylating and activating ATG1/ULK1 (PubMed:21205641). In that process, it also activates WDR45/WIPI4 (PubMed:28561066). Phosphorylates CASP6, thereby preventing its autoprocessing and subsequent activation (PubMed:32029622). AMPK also acts as a regulator of circadian rhythm by mediating phosphorylation of CRY1, leading to destabilize it (By similarity). May regulate the Wnt signaling pathway by phosphorylating CTNNB1, leading to stabilize it (By similarity). Also acts as a regulator of cellular polarity by remodeling the actin cytoskeleton; probably by indirectly activating myosin (PubMed:17486097). Also phosphorylates CFTR, EEF2K, KLC1, NOS3 and SLC12A1 (PubMed:12519745, PubMed:20074060). Plays an important role in the differential regulation of pro-autophagy (composed of PIK3C3, BECN1, PIK3R4 and UVRAG or ATG14) and non-autophagy (composed of PIK3C3, BECN1 and PIK3R4) complexes, in response to glucose starvation (By similarity). Can inhibit the non-autophagy complex by phosphorylating PIK3C3 and can activate the pro-autophagy complex by phosphorylating BECN1 (By similarity). Upon glucose starvation, promotes ARF6 activation in a kinase-independent manner leading to cell migration (PubMed:36017701). Upon glucose deprivation mediates the phosphorylation of ACSS2 at 'Ser-659', which exposes the nuclear localization signal of ACSS2, required for its interaction with KPNA1 and nuclear translocation (PubMed:28552616). Upon stress, regulates mitochondrial fragmentation through phosphorylation of MTFR1L (PubMed:36367943)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nThe 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) catalytic subunit alpha‑2, encoded by PRKAA2 and commonly referred to as AMPKα2 or AMPK2, belongs to the highly conserved SNF1/AMPK family of serine/threonine kinases. This protein is evolutionarily conserved in all eukaryotes, tracing its ancestry back to the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA). In yeast the homolog is known as Snf1, and in plants similar orthologs exist, indicating that the core mechanism for energy sensing is ancient and ubiquitous. Within the human kinome, AMPKα2 is grouped with other energy sensor enzymes and shares close evolutionary relationships with regulatory kinases such as LKB1—a master upstream kinase that phosphorylates AMPK—and with other members of the AMPK-related kinase family. Members of this group, which include both catalytic subunit isoforms (alpha‑1 and alpha‑2) as well as regulatory subunits (beta and gamma), form the foundation of cellular energy monitoring systems. The conservation of AMPKα2 across mammalian species further establishes its essential role in metabolic regulation (scott2007regulationofamp‐activated pages 1-2, wallimann2013nouveauregardsur pages 16-19, zorman2013afreshlook pages 18-22).  \n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nAMPKα2 functions as a serine/threonine protein kinase that catalyzes the reversible transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues in target proteins. The general chemical reaction can be summarized as follows:  \n  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine)-phosphate + H⁺.  \nThis phosphorylation reaction modulates the activity of numerous downstream substrates, thereby exerting control over metabolic pathways. The reaction uses ATP as a substrate and requires the proper positioning of the target hydroxyl group for catalysis. This is a common feature of non-specific serine/threonine phosphotransferases and is central to AMPK’s role in switching off anabolic and switching on catabolic metabolism under conditions of energy stress (schaffer2015identificationofdirect pages 37-40, zhang2013investigationintoampk pages 17-20).  \n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of AMPKα2 is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions, with Mg²⁺ being essential for coordinating the ATP molecule within the active site. Magnesium serves as a cofactor by stabilizing the negative charges on the phosphate groups of ATP during the phosphoryl transfer reaction. This requirement for Mg²⁺ is a characteristic shared by many protein kinases, ensuring proper alignment of substrates in the catalytic cleft (alexander2015theconciseguide pages 1-2).  \n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nAMPKα2 exhibits substrate specificity that is governed by the recognition of serine/threonine motifs within its target proteins. Several biochemical studies have indicated that AMPK preferentially phosphorylates substrates that contain motifs with basic and hydrophobic amino acid residues positioned typically at defined distances relative to the phosphorylated residue. Although a canonical consensus sequence for AMPK is not as rigid as that of some other kinases, substrates often include features such as a leucine or hydrophobic residue at the −5 position and basic residues in the vicinity, for example in positions −3 to −1, relative to the phosphorylation site. In many cases, the motif may conform approximately to an LxRxxS/T sequence, which supports efficient substrate recognition (schaffer2015identificationofdirect pages 15-18, zhang2013investigationintoampk pages 17-20). This substrate preference ensures that AMPK regulates critical metabolic enzymes and transcription regulators by phosphorylating specific serine/threonine residues that control their activity in response to shifts in cellular energy availability.  \n\n5. Structure  \nThe structural organization of AMPKα2 encompasses several distinct domains that are critical for its catalytic and regulatory functions. The N-terminal portion of the protein contains the catalytic kinase domain, which is highly conserved among protein kinases and includes essential structural features such as the glycine-rich loop, the catalytic loop, the activation segment, and the C-helix. The activation loop, which contains the critical threonine residue Thr172, is central to the regulation of enzyme activity through phosphorylation by upstream kinases. Adjacent to the catalytic domain is the autoinhibitory domain (AID), a region that in the inactive state interacts with the kinase domain and limits its activity. Structural studies, including crystallographic analyses and homology modeling, have provided insight into how the AID is displaced upon enzyme activation, thereby relieving inhibition. In addition, the C-terminal region of AMPKα2 mediates interactions with the regulatory beta and gamma subunits, which assemble to form the heterotrimeric complex. The beta subunit contains a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) that contributes to intracellular localization by binding glycogen, while the gamma subunit contains multiple cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) domains. These CBS domains bind adenine nucleotides (AMP, ADP, and ATP) to allosterically regulate AMPK activity by inducing conformational changes that influence the catalytic domain’s accessibility and protection of Thr172. Unique structural features of AMPKα2 include its enhanced sensitivity to AMP, which correlates with its propensity for nuclear localization in certain tissues. The overall three-dimensional arrangement ensures that the kinase integrates both phosphorylation signals and nucleotide binding to achieve precise regulation of energy metabolism (day2007structureofa pages 1-2, schaffer2015identificationofdirect pages 10-15, wallimann2013nouveauregardsur pages 31-33, zorman2013afreshlook pages 32-34).  \n\n6. Regulation  \nAMPKα2 is tightly regulated by both covalent modifications and allosteric interactions, reflecting its central role in balancing cellular energy status. The principal mode of regulatory activation involves the phosphorylation of Thr172, located in the activation loop of the kinase domain. This phosphorylation is predominantly carried out by upstream kinases, including liver kinase B1 (LKB1) and Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-beta (CaMKKβ), under conditions where the intracellular AMP:ATP ratio is elevated. Once phosphorylated at Thr172, AMPKα2 exhibits a dramatic (often over 100-fold) increase in kinase activity. In addition to phosphorylation, binding of AMP or ADP to the CBS domains in the gamma subunit results in allosteric activation of the enzyme. This nucleotide binding not only induces conformational changes that enhance enzyme activity but also protects Thr172 from dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases such as PP2A, PP2C, and PPM family members. Other post-translational modifications, including additional phosphorylation events at secondary sites, have been reported to influence enzyme activity and stability, although the primary activation mechanism remains dependent on Thr172 phosphorylation and AMP-mediated allosteric effects. These regulatory mechanisms ensure that AMPKα2 is activated rapidly in response to cellular energy stress, thereby facilitating prompt metabolic adjustments (scott2007regulationofamp‐activated pages 1-2, schaffer2015identificationofdirect pages 22-26, steinberg2023newinsightsinto pages 9-13, wang2018dysregulationofampactivated pages 9-13).  \n\n7. Function  \nAMPKα2 serves as the catalytic core of the AMPK heterotrimer and plays a pivotal role as an intracellular energy sensor. When intracellular ATP levels fall and AMP (or ADP) levels rise, AMPKα2 is activated – first by phosphorylation at Thr172 and subsequently through allosteric binding of AMP/ADP – leading to a broad shift in cellular metabolism toward energy production and conservation. This activation results in the direct phosphorylation of a myriad of metabolic enzymes and transcription regulators. For instance, AMPKα2 phosphorylates key enzymes involved in lipid biosynthesis such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACACA and ACACB) and hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), thereby inhibiting fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis. Concurrently, AMPKα2 modulates insulin signaling and glucose uptake by phosphorylating substrates such as IRS1, TBC1D4/AS160, and components that affect GLUT4 translocation. In addition, AMPKα2 impacts protein synthesis and cell growth by regulating mTORC1 indirectly through phosphorylation of components like TSC2 and RPTOR, which leads to the inhibition of anabolic processes. Beyond these metabolic roles, AMPKα2 also has been implicated in the regulation of transcription and chromatin remodeling through the phosphorylation of transcriptional coactivators and histone proteins (e.g., CRTC2, FOXO3, and histone H2B), thereby inducing longer-term changes in gene expression that sustain metabolic adaptations. Moreover, the subunit has been involved in the regulation of autophagy via the phosphorylation of ULK1, consequently promoting the clearance of damaged organelles and proteins under nutrient deprivation. Functionally, AMPKα2 is expressed in energy-demanding tissues, such as skeletal muscle, heart, and liver, where its activity is critical for maintaining energy homeostasis during metabolic stress. Additionally, isoform-specific roles have been noted, where AMPKα2 complexes exhibit distinct subcellular localizations, such as increased nuclear translocation, suggesting specialized functions in genomic regulation and stress responses (schaffer2015identificationofdirect pages 26-30, wallimann2013nouveauregardsur pages 38-39, tarasiuk2022ampkanddiseases pages 5-6, zorman2013afreshlook pages 29-32).  \n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral pharmacological activators of AMPK have been identified and are of considerable interest due to their therapeutic potential in metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disorders. Agents including metformin and AICAR activate AMPK indirectly by altering cellular energy balance, while novel small-molecule activators such as Activator‑3 have been designed to mimic AMP binding and directly stimulate AMPK activity (bung20182aceticacid pages 1-2, bung20182aceticacid pages 4-5). In addition to activators, various phosphatases (e.g., PP2A, PP2C, and PPM family members) are known to dephosphorylate AMPKα2, decreasing its activity; such negative regulation has implications in disease states associated with impaired energy sensing. Dysregulation of AMPKα2 has been linked to several pathological conditions. For instance, alterations in AMPK signaling are observed in metabolic syndromes, while aberrant AMPK activity is implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative conditions and certain types of cancer. Known disease associations include insulin resistance, impaired lipid metabolism, and the development of cardiomyopathy, the latter being associated with mutations in regulatory subunits that affect AMPK activity (tarasiuk2022ampkanddiseases pages 1-3, wang2018dysregulationofampactivated pages 9-13, zorman2013afreshlook pages 48-52). The specificity of AMPK inhibitors remains a subject of ongoing research, and resources such as kinase inhibitor databases continue to be important for assessing compound selectivity. With its central role in energy regulation and diverse downstream effects, AMPKα2 remains a high-priority target for future drug development and therapeutic modulation (bung20182aceticacid pages 15-15, schaffer2015identificationofdirect pages 37-40).  \n\n9.

Plays an important role in cellular stress response. Contributes to regulation of renal Na(+) retention, renal K(+) elimination, salt appetite, gastric acid secretion, intestinal Na(+)/H(+) exchange and nutrient transport, insulin-dependent salt sensitivity of blood pressure, salt sensitivity of peripheral glucose uptake, cardiac repolarization and memory consolidation. Up-regulates Na(+) channels: SCNN1A/ENAC, SCN5A and ASIC1/ACCN2, K(+) channels: KCNJ1/ROMK1, KCNA1-5, KCNQ1-5 and KCNE1, epithelial Ca(2+) channels: TRPV5 and TRPV6, chloride channels: BSND, CLCN2 and CFTR, glutamate transporters: SLC1A3/EAAT1, SLC1A2 /EAAT2, SLC1A1/EAAT3, SLC1A6/EAAT4 and SLC1A7/EAAT5, amino acid transporters: SLC1A5/ASCT2, SLC38A1/SN1 and SLC6A19, creatine transporter: SLC6A8, Na(+)/dicarboxylate cotransporter: SLC13A2/NADC1, Na(+)-dependent phosphate cotransporter: SLC34A2/NAPI-2B, glutamate receptor: GRIK2/GLUR6.

Regulates enzymes: GSK3A/B, PMM2 and Na(+)/K(+) ATPase, and transcription factors: CTNNB1 and nuclear factor NF-kappa-B. Stimulates sodium transport into epithelial cells by enhancing the stability and expression of SCNN1A/ENAC. This is achieved by phosphorylating the NEDD4L ubiquitin E3 ligase, promoting its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, thereby preventing it from binding to SCNN1A/ENAC and targeting it for degradation. Regulates store-operated Ca(+2) entry (SOCE) by stimulating ORAI1 and STIM1. Regulates KCNJ1/ROMK1 directly via its phosphorylation or indirectly via increased interaction with SLC9A3R2/NHERF2. Phosphorylates MDM2 and activates MDM2-dependent ubiquitination of p53/TP53. Phosphorylates MAPT/TAU and mediates microtubule depolymerization and neurite formation in hippocampal neurons. Phosphorylates SLC2A4/GLUT4 and up-regulates its activity. Phosphorylates APBB1/FE65 and promotes its localization to the nucleus. Phosphorylates MAPK1/ERK2 and activates it by enhancing its interaction with MAP2K1/MEK1 and MAP2K2/MEK2. Phosphorylates FBXW7 and plays an inhibitory role in the NOTCH1 signaling. Phosphorylates FOXO1 resulting in its relocalization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Phosphorylates FOXO3, promoting its exit from the nucleus and interference with FOXO3-dependent transcription. Phosphorylates BRAF and MAP3K3/MEKK3 and inhibits their activity. Phosphorylates SLC9A3/NHE3 in response to dexamethasone, resulting in its activation and increased localization at the cell membrane. Phosphorylates CREB1. Necessary for vascular remodeling during angiogenesis. Sustained high levels and activity may contribute to conditions such as hypertension and diabetic nephropathy.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nSerine/threonine‐protein kinase SGK1 belongs to the AGC kinase family and is one of three SGK isoforms (SGK1, SGK2, and SGK3) that are conserved across vertebrates, with orthologs present in all mammalian species. SGK1 shares evolutionary relationships with other AGC kinases such as Akt/PKB, and its catalytic domain is highly conserved relative to these kinases (jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 1-3, maestro2020serumandglucocorticoidinduced pages 3-4). The kinase forms part of the evolutionary core of TOR pathway regulators alongside PDK1, PKB (Akt), RSK, and other AGC kinases, an ancient set traceable to the common ancestor of eukaryotes (maestro2020serumandglucocorticoidinduced pages 3-4, akhoon2019computationalinsightsinto pages 1-4).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nSGK1 catalyzes the phosphorylation reaction in which ATP and a protein substrate containing a serine or threonine residue are converted into ADP, the phosphorylated protein, and a proton:  \n  ATP + [protein]‑(L‑serine or L‑threonine) → ADP + [protein]‑(L‑serine/threonine‑phosphate) + H⁺ (akhoon2019computationalinsightsinto pages 1-4).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of SGK1 depends on the presence of divalent metal ions, with Mg²⁺ being required as a cofactor for proper ATP binding and phosphoryl transfer during catalysis (akhoon2019computationalinsightsinto pages 1-4).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nSGK1 primarily phosphorylates substrates on serine and threonine residues in a consensus sequence that generally features basic amino acids upstream of the phospho-acceptor site. Biochemical studies indicate that SGK1, similar to Akt, shows a substrate preference for motifs characterized by arginine residues at defined positions, with evidence supporting a consensus pattern resembling R‑X‑R‑X‑X‑[S/T] (douglass2012identifyingproteinkinase pages 12-12, maestro2020serumandglucocorticoidinduced pages 3-4).\n\n5. Structure  \nSGK1 is organized into distinct domains that contribute to its catalytic function and regulation. The protein contains an N-terminal PX-like domain that is implicated in subcellular localization and possibly membrane association, a central kinase domain responsible for catalytic activity, and a C-terminal hydrophobic motif. The catalytic domain displays the typical bilobal architecture seen in serine/threonine kinases, with an N-terminal lobe composed primarily of β-strands and a C-terminal lobe predominantly made up of α-helices. Key conserved motifs within the kinase domain include the DFG motif in the activation loop, which is essential for coordinating ATP and the required divalent cation, as well as a regulatory αC helix that adopts distinct conformations in active versus inactive states (akhoon2019computationalinsightsinto pages 4-7, jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 1-3). Structural studies and molecular dynamics simulations have highlighted that in the inactive conformation, SGK1 may lack a fully formed αC helix, whereas phosphorylation-dependent activation induces the inward movement of the helix and assembly of the regulatory spine (akhoon2019computationalinsightsinto pages 7-9, maestro2020serumandglucocorticoidinduced pages 4-6).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe full activation of SGK1 is achieved through a series of phosphorylation events. Primarily, phosphorylation occurs on Thr256 within the activation loop by 3‑phosphoinositide‑dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) following priming by mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), which phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif at Ser422. This two‐step phosphorylation process is crucial for stabilizing the active conformation of the kinase (jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 1-3, maestro2020serumandglucocorticoidinduced pages 3-4). In addition to these activating events, SGK1 is transcriptionally induced by serum and glucocorticoids and is further regulated by rapid ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation, resulting in a short half-life for both its mRNA and protein forms (maestro2020serumandglucocorticoidinduced pages 3-4, akhoon2019computationalinsightsinto pages 1-4). Conformational plasticity, as evidenced by molecular dynamics studies, also contributes to its regulation by facilitating transitions between inactive (DFG-out) and active (DFG-in) states (akhoon2019computationalinsightsinto pages 19-22).\n\n7. Function  \nSGK1 plays multifaceted roles in cellular physiology and stress response by regulating a wide array of substrates. It modulates ion channel activities, including the up-regulation of epithelial Na⁺ channels (ENaC) through the phosphorylation of the NEDD4L ubiquitin E3 ligase, which prevents ENaC degradation; it also regulates various K⁺, Ca²⁺, and Cl⁻ channels. SGK1 controls membrane transporter function by affecting multiple solute carrier proteins, including glucose transporters (GLUT1 and GLUT4), amino acid transporters, and sodium-dependent nutrient cotransporters. In addition, SGK1 phosphorylates key intracellular enzymes such as glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3A/B) and modulates transcription factors including FOXO1 and FOXO3, thereby influencing cell growth, survival, migration, and apoptosis (jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 1-3, maestro2020serumandglucocorticoidinduced pages 7-8). SGK1 also impacts neuronal functions by phosphorylating proteins such as TAU, which is involved in microtubule dynamics and neurite formation, and it contributes to cardiac repolarization and memory consolidation through its effects on ion channels and transporter expression. Furthermore, SGK1 can phosphorylate MDM2, leading to enhanced ubiquitination of p53, and it modulates the activity of MAP kinases (MAPK1/ERK2) by facilitating their interaction with upstream activators (maestro2020serumandglucocorticoidinduced pages 7-8, jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 13-14).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral small-molecule inhibitors targeting SGK1 have been developed for experimental purposes. Notable inhibitors include GSK650394, EMD638683, SI113, and herbacetin, which have been evaluated in various preclinical models. These inhibitors are of interest due to SGK1’s involvement in pathophysiological conditions such as hypertension, diabetic nephropathy, cardiac hypertrophy, and various cancers. Elevated levels and sustained activity of SGK1 have been correlated with increased sodium retention, insulin-dependent salt sensitivity of blood pressure, and drug resistance mechanisms in breast cancer. Inhibitors of SGK1 may prove beneficial in modulating its activity to address these disease states (jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 13-14, jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 4-5, banerjee2013phosphorylationubiquitylationand pages 26-29).\n\n9.
