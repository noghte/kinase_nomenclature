Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nSerine/threonine‐protein kinase H1 (PSKH1; UniProt P11801) is a member of the eukaryotic protein kinase (ePK) superfamily and is categorically placed within the serine/threonine kinases. Several studies have placed PSKH1 in the Ca²⁺/calmodulin–dependent kinase (CAMK) branch based on its sequence characteristics. Notably, Brede et al. demonstrated considerable sequence similarity between PSKH1 and members of the CaMK family – with approximately 50% identity in the catalytic domain relative to rat CaMKI – and assigned it to a unique subfamily within the serine/threonine kinases (brede2000characterizationofpskh1 pages 3-6). In addition, phylogenetic analyses have revealed that although PSKH1 is conserved across certain vertebrate lineages, it is absent from the mouse kinome, suggesting a lineage-specific gene loss in the rodent branch (caenepeel2004themousekinome pages 2-3). Cataloguing efforts by Shrestha et al. further corroborate that PSKH1 represents a canonical active kinase in vertebrates while being distinct from its close paralog, the pseudokinase PSKH2 (shrestha2020cataloguingthedead pages 12-14). Collectively, this pattern of conservation and selective loss places PSKH1 in an evolutionary context as part of an ancient CAMK-related module within the human kinome (manning2010eukaryotickinomesgenomics pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nPSKH1 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to target proteins on serine or threonine residues. The reaction can be summarized as:  \nATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (anti2009nonspecificserinethreonineprotein pages 1-7).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of PSKH1, like that of many serine/threonine kinases, requires the presence of divalent metal ion cofactors. In particular, the enzyme’s activity is dependent on Mg²⁺, which coordinates with the phosphate groups of ATP to facilitate phosphoryl transfer (anti2009nonspecificserinethreonineprotein pages 1-7).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nThe substrate specificity of PSKH1 is functionally linked to its role in regulating pre-mRNA processing. PSKH1 is implicated in phosphorylating components of nuclear splice factor compartments, notably non-snRNP splicing factors that contain serine/arginine-rich (SR) domains. The reversible phosphorylation of these SR proteins modulates their intranuclear distribution, thereby influencing alternative splicing decisions. Although a precise consensus substrate motif has not been defined for PSKH1, the evidence points toward its preferential activity on substrates enriched for serine/arginine repeats (berson1999identificationandcharacterization pages 4-5, shrestha2020cataloguingthedead pages 12-14).\n\n5. Structure  \nPSKH1 is a relatively small kinase, comprising approximately 305 amino acids. Its domain organization features an amino-terminal segment of 19 residues that includes multiple potential fatty acylation sites—a myristoylation site at glycine 2 and palmitoylation sites at cysteines 6 and 8—which are flanked by basic residues that resemble membrane-targeting SH4 domains (berson1999identificationandcharacterization pages 4-5). The catalytic domain of PSKH1 spans roughly residues ~20 to 294 and exhibits the 12 conserved kinase subdomains typical of active serine/threonine kinases. Key catalytic residues within this domain include lysine at position 49, which is essential for ATP binding, and histidine at position 146, with the conserved APE motif commencing at alanine 200. Such features support a canonical active fold with an N-terminal β-sheet rich lobe and a C-terminal α-helical lobe, forming a catalytic cleft. The overall structural organization, largely derived from experimental studies and bioinformatics predictions, indicates that the intrinsically disordered regions are minimal, with the majority of the protein comprising the conserved catalytic machinery necessary for phosphotransfer (berson1999identificationandcharacterization pages 4-5).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulatory mechanisms of PSKH1 are multi-faceted. A unique characteristic of PSKH1 is its post-translational modification via dual fatty acylation. The myristoylation at glycine 2 is obligatory for subsequent palmitoylation at cysteines 6 and 8; these lipid modifications are critical for targeting PSKH1 to membrane compartments (berson1999identificationandcharacterization pages 4-5). In cellular expression systems, kinase assays have demonstrated that PSKH1 is capable of autophosphorylation primarily on threonine residues, and it also phosphorylates exogenous substrates such as PHAS-I. Furthermore, PSKH1’s regulation does not appear to involve a classical calmodulin-binding domain, although a stretch resembling a CaMKI calmodulin-binding motif is present in the N-terminal region, as noted in the detailed characterization reports (brede2000characterizationofpskh1 pages 3-6, shrestha2020cataloguingthedead pages 12-14). Taken together, these findings indicate that the regulatory state of PSKH1 is controlled by a combination of lipid-mediated membrane association and phosphorylation-dependent modulation of its catalytic activity.\n\n7. Function  \nPSKH1 functions as a serine/threonine protein kinase involved in the regulation of pre-mRNA processing. Specifically, it is proposed to phosphorylate components of nuclear splice factor compartments, notably SR proteins that possess serine/arginine-rich domains. The reversible phosphorylation of these splicing factors is thought to modulate their release into the nucleoplasm, thereby altering their local concentration and influencing alternative splicing decisions. This role places PSKH1 at a crucial nodal point linking post-transcriptional regulation to broader gene expression programs. In addition, PSKH1 has been reported to exhibit a distinct subcellular distribution; several studies associate it with membrane structures such as the Golgi apparatus owing to its validated membrane-targeting motif generated by its acyl modifications (shrestha2020cataloguingthedead pages 12-14). Although the precise substrates of PSKH1 in vivo and its integration into signaling cascades are still being elucidated, the available data underscore its involvement in nuclear RNA processing and potentially in the regulation of alternative splicing events (berson1999identificationandcharacterization pages 4-5).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nPSKH1 is catalogued under the Enzyme Commission number EC 2.7.11.1, which includes non-specific serine/threonine protein kinases. It has been referred to as Protein serine kinase H1 in alternative nomenclature systems. The absence of PSKH1 from the mouse kinome—as shown in comprehensive kinome comparisons—further highlights an interesting case of lineage-specific gene loss in rodents (caenepeel2004themousekinome pages 2-3). Moreover, while PSKH1 has not been extensively linked to specific disease states in the available literature, its role in the regulation of alternative splicing posits a potential involvement in conditions where splicing misregulation is a hallmark. No well-characterized inhibitors have been reported exclusively targeting PSKH1 at this time; however, its classification within the serine/threonine kinase family suggests that inhibitors developed against similar kinases may provide a starting point for probing its function. The convergence of post-translational acylation events and phosphorylation-based regulation in PSKH1 underscores its potential as a modulator of pre-mRNA processing and cellular localization dynamics (berson1999identificationandcharacterization pages 4-5, shrestha2020cataloguingthedead pages 12-14).\n\n9.

S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nIRAK1 (Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1) is a conserved serine/threonine kinase that belongs to the IRAK family within the human kinome. Orthologs of IRAK1 have been identified across mammalian species and are evolutionarily related to other members of the IRAK family, including IRAK4, IRAK2, and the inactive pseudokinase IRAK-M. In addition, sequence homology has been observed with the Drosophila Pelle kinase, indicating that the ancestral gene duplication events leading to the current IRAK family occurred early in animal evolution. Thus, IRAK1 is part of an evolutionarily conserved signaling machinery that mediates innate immune responses through Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) pathways (gosu2012molecularevolutionand pages 1-2, janssens2003functionaldiversityand pages 1-2, gottipati2008irak1acritical pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nIRAK1 catalyzes a phosphorylation reaction in which ATP and a protein substrate containing serine or threonine residues are converted to ADP and a phosphorylated protein. In biochemical terms, the reaction can be summarized as:  \nATP + [protein] – (L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein] – (L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺.  \nIn the context of innate immune signaling, IRAK1 phosphorylates several downstream targets. Its substrates include the E3 ubiquitin ligases of the Pellino family, leading to Pellino-mediated polyubiquitination events, as well as adaptor proteins such as TIRAP and regulators such as interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7). These phosphorylation events are central to propagating the signal that ultimately activates transcription factors such as NF-κB and interferon-regulatory factors (flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 43-47, jain2014il1receptorassociatedkinase pages 2-3).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of IRAK1 requires divalent metal ions. As is common for serine/threonine kinases, IRAK1 depends on Mg²⁺ as a cofactor for efficient ATP binding and catalysis. The presence of Mg²⁺ facilitates proper orientation of ATP within the active site, thereby enabling the transfer of the phosphoryl group to the substrate (flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 43-47, wang2017crystalstructureof pages 5-5).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nIRAK1 exhibits substrate specificity for serine and threonine residues within its target proteins, though a detailed consensus motif has not been completely defined in the literature presently available. However, IRAK1 is well known to phosphorylate substrates that are crucial for downstream signal propagation in innate immune signaling. In particular, IRAK1 phosphorylates the E3 ubiquitin ligases in the Pellino family (PELI1, PELI2, and PELI3), thereby promoting Pellino-mediated polyubiquitination events that facilitate the assembly of downstream kinase complexes. In addition, IRAK1 phosphorylates the adaptor molecule TIRAP to promote its ubiquitination and eventual degradation, as well as IRF7, thereby inducing its activation and nuclear translocation. Furthermore, when modified by sumoylation, IRAK1 translocates to the nucleus and phosphorylates STAT3. These reactions underscore IRAK1’s role in recognizing specific serine/threonine-rich regions on its substrates within the TLR/IL-1 receptor signaling pathways (gottipati2008irak1acritical pages 2-3, flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 43-47, jain2014il1receptorassociatedkinase pages 2-3).\n\n5. Structure  \nIRAK1 is organized into several distinctive domains that are critical for its function in innate immunity. At its N-terminus, IRAK1 contains a death domain (DD) which mediates homotypic protein-protein interactions, especially enabling binding to adaptor proteins such as MyD88. Immediately following the death domain is the proline/serine/threonine-rich (ProST) region, which is implicated in regulatory functions such as autophosphorylation and interactions leading to subsequent ubiquitination and degradation. The central portion of the protein is composed of a conserved kinase domain that is responsible for catalytic activity. Key residues within the kinase domain include an invariant lysine, for example K239, which is located in the ATP binding site, as well as an essential aspartate, D340, required for catalysis. In the activation loop of the kinase domain, phosphorylation sites such as T209 and T387 have been identified; these sites are phosphorylated first by IRAK4 and subsequently undergo autophosphorylation, thereby promoting full activation of IRAK1. The kinase domain also possesses a unique tyrosine gatekeeper residue (Y288 in IRAK1) that controls access to a hydrophobic pocket near the ATP binding site; this feature is a defining structural characteristic of the IRAK family kinases and has been used to inform structure-based inhibitor design (flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 43-47, jain2014il1receptorassociatedkinase pages 1-2, wang2017crystalstructureof pages 4-5).\n\nThe overall three‐dimensional structure, as inferred from crystallography studies of human IRAK1 kinase domain constructs, reveals that the catalytic core adopts the typical bilobal architecture found in most protein kinases where the N-lobe is predominantly β-sheet and the C-lobe is mainly helical. The activation loop in IRAK1 is critical for regulating its kinase activity; its phosphorylation status determines whether the enzyme is in an active conformation with an assembled regulatory spine that includes hydrophobic and polar interactions among key residues such as the catalytic lysine, the gatekeeper tyrosine, and the aspartate of the DFG motif. There is also evidence suggesting that full-length IRAK1, which contains additional regulatory regions at the N- and C-termini, may be autoinhibited by intramolecular interactions that are relieved upon phosphorylation-driven conformational changes (wang2017crystalstructureof pages 5-5, flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 43-47).\n\n6. Regulation  \nIRAK1 activity is tightly regulated by various post-translational modifications and protein–protein interaction events that ensure a controlled immune response. One of the primary modes of regulation is phosphorylation. Upon activation of TLRs or IL-1Rs, MyD88 is recruited to the receptor complex, and IRAK4 phosphorylates IRAK1 at specific threonine residues (for example, T209 and T387) within the kinase domain activation loop. This event is followed by IRAK1 autophosphorylation, which enhances its catalytic activity. These phosphorylation events also serve as triggers for subsequent modifications: once hyperphosphorylated, IRAK1 dissociates from the myddosome complex to interact with downstream signaling molecules such as TRAF6, Pellino proteins, and other components of the NF-κB activating cascade (gottipati2008irak1acritical pages 2-3, flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 43-47).\n\nIRAK1 is also subject to ubiquitination. Ubiquitin ligases such as Pellino are recruited following IRAK1 phosphorylation, leading to polyubiquitination of IRAK1 on lysine residues. The polyubiquitinated form of IRAK1 is then recognized by the ubiquitin-binding domain of NEMO (IKKγ), which helps bridge the complex with subsequent kinases including TAK1, ultimately resulting in the activation of the IKK complex and nuclear translocation of NF-κB. Concurrently, IRAK1 contains PEST sequences—regions rich in proline, glutamate, serine, and threonine—that serve as degradation signals. These sequences promote proteasomal degradation of IRAK1, thereby providing a negative feedback mechanism to curb prolonged signaling (flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 5-9, suzuki2005irakskeyregulatory pages 1-2).\n\nIn addition to phosphorylation and ubiquitination, IRAK1 undergoes sumoylation. The sumoylated form of IRAK1 is capable of translocating to the nucleus, where it has distinct functions including the phosphorylation of STAT3. Nuclear IRAK1 contributes to the transcriptional regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-10, and is involved in promoting an antiviral state through the activation of interferon regulatory factors (singer2018inhibitionofinterleukin1 pages 1-2, li2005novelroleand pages 1-2).\n\nFurthermore, alternative splicing of IRAK1 mRNA leads to the generation of splice variants, such as IRAK1b, which, despite being kinase-inactive, retain the capacity to participate in signaling complexes and can modulate NF-κB activation. Such splice variants underscore the complex regulation of IRAK1 function by different mechanisms (gottipati2008irak1acritical pages 3-5, martin2001interleukin1receptorassociatedkinase1 pages 2-4).\n\n7. Function  \nIRAK1 serves as a central mediator in the innate immune response, particularly in the context of TLR and IL-1 receptor signaling pathways. Upon engagement of these receptors by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or interleukin-1 ligands, MyD88 is recruited to the receptor complex. IRAK1 is then rapidly brought in via its death domain, where it is phosphorylated by IRAK4. This phosphorylation initiates a cascade of events including IRAK1 autophosphorylation, dissociation from the receptor complex, and subsequent interactions with downstream effector proteins (flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 5-9, jain2014il1receptorassociatedkinase pages 1-2).\n\nDownstream of these events, IRAK1 phosphorylates key substrates:\n– It targets Pellino E3 ubiquitin ligases (PELI1, PELI2, and PELI3), thereby enabling these enzymes to ubiquitinate IRAK1 and associated proteins. This polyubiquitination is pivotal for bridging the IRAK1-MAP3K7/TAK1-TRAF6 complex with the NEMO-IKK complex, leading to NF-κB activation and the subsequent induction of pro-inflammatory gene expression.  \n– IRAK1 also phosphorylates adaptor proteins such as TIRAP, marking them for ubiquitination and degradation, which is part of the feedback regulation controlling signal duration.  \n– In the antiviral response branch, IRAK1 phosphorylates IRF7 to facilitate its activation and nuclear localization, thereby triggering the expression of type I interferon genes.  \n– Moreover, when IRAK1 is sumoylated and translocates to the nucleus, it phosphorylates STAT3, contributing to additional transcriptional responses that modulate immune responses (flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 43-47, singer2018inhibitionofinterleukin1 pages 18-19).\n\nIRAK1 is ubiquitously expressed in various cell types, including monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells, and B cells, which supports its role as a key regulator in both innate and adaptive immunity. The kinase is essential for the timely activation of NF-κB and other transcription factors involved in immune and inflammatory responses, while also being implicated in post-transcriptional regulation such as mRNA stabilization of inflammatory cytokines (gottipati2008irak1acritical pages 1-2, pereira2023regulationofinnate pages 1-2, singer2018inhibitionofinterleukin1 pages 1-2).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral pharmacological inhibitors targeting IRAK1 (and closely related IRAK4) have been identified and are under investigation for therapeutic applications in inflammatory diseases and certain cancers. Pacritinib, originally developed as a JAK2/FLT3 inhibitor, has been shown to potently inhibit IRAK1 in addition to its primary targets, thereby reducing levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in models of diseases such as myelofibrosis and certain lymphomas. Other small molecule inhibitors have been designed to target the kinase domain of IRAK1 by exploiting the unique tyrosine gatekeeper residue which modulates access to the ATP-binding pocket. These studies underscore the therapeutic interest in modulating IRAK1 activity to reduce aberrant inflammation and immune activation (singer2018inhibitionofinterleukin1 pages 1-2, rhyasen2015iraksignallingin pages 5-6).\n\nDysregulation of IRAK1 signaling has been implicated in several disease conditions including autoimmune disorders, chronic inflammatory states, and malignancies. Alterations in IRAK1 expression or activity can lead to improper NF-κB activation, contributing to the pathogenesis of diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Furthermore, certain cancer subtypes show a dependency on IRAK1-mediated signaling pathways for tumor progression and survival, which makes IRAK1 a potential target for cancer therapeutics. Notably, splice variants like IRAK1b, which lack kinase activity but retain adaptor function, may contribute to the complexity of IRAK1-mediated signaling and its association with disease phenotypes (flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 24-28, singer2018inhibitionofinterleukin1 pages 2-6, li2005novelroleand pages 4-4).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nIRAK2 is a member of the interleukin‑1 receptor‑associated kinase (IRAK) family, which in mammals comprises four principal members: IRAK1, IRAK2, IRAK‑M (also known as IRAK3), and IRAK4. Phylogenetic analyses reveal that IRAK2 is evolutionarily related to both IRAK1 and IRAK4, and its lineage appears to have originated through gene duplication events from an ancestral IRAK4‑like kinase present early in vertebrate evolution (benosman2013interleukin1receptorassociatedkinase2 pages 3-3, gosu2012molecularevolutionand pages 1-2). Orthologs of IRAK2 are widely conserved in mammals, and comparable proteins have been identified in invertebrates such as Drosophila, where the homolog Tube performs analogous functions in Toll‑mediated immune signaling. Sequence comparisons across species indicate that the catalytic regions, including the central kinase domain and the protein–protein interaction modules such as the death domain, are highly conserved among the IRAK family. In particular, IRAK2 is classified as a non‑RD kinase, which means that unlike typical RD kinases it lacks the conserved arginine residue immediately preceding the catalytic aspartate in the activation segment. This non‑RD feature is shared with several kinases that have evolved to serve more in scaffolding or regulatory roles rather than providing robust catalytic activity in classical phosphorylation reactions (biswas2007myeloiddifferentiationfactor pages 4-5, dardick2006plantandanimal pages 6-7). Furthermore, multiple analyses of its domain structure and sequence homology imply that although IRAK2 may exhibit lower intrinsic catalytic activity compared to other kinases, its evolutionarily conserved domains reflect its indispensability in the assembly of multi‑protein complexes, such as the Myddosome, that are critical for downstream signal transduction in innate immunity (gosu2012molecularevolutionand pages 14-15, maschera1999overexpressionofan pages 4-5).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nIRAK2 functions in a manner characteristic of serine/threonine protein kinases. The reaction catalyzed by IRAK2 involves the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins. In this phosphorylation reaction, ATP and a protein substrate that possesses accessible serine or threonine residues are converted into ADP and a phosphorylated form of the substrate, along with the release of a proton (H⁺). The chemical reaction may be summarized as: ATP + [protein]-(L‑serine or L‑threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L‑serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺. Although certain isoforms or contexts have led to the categorization of IRAK2 as having noncanonical kinase activity, the catalytic event that IRAK2 is thought to mediate, at least by analogy to other serine/threonine kinases, is the aforementioned phosphoryl transfer (benosman2013interleukin1receptorassociatedkinase2 pages 1-3).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nConsistent with the general mechanism of protein kinases, IRAK2’s catalytic activity is dependent on binding divalent cations that help coordinate the ATP molecule necessary for the phosphoryl transfer. In particular, Mg²⁺ ions serve as a crucial cofactor for IRAK2, as they facilitate the proper positioning of ATP within the active site and stabilize the negative charges that develop during the transition state of the reaction. This requirement for Mg²⁺ is a universal property observed in most kinases and is essential for catalytic function in a cellular context (wang2006crystalstructuresof pages 5-7).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nThe substrate specificity of IRAK2, although not exhaustively defined in the literature, is inferred by its close relationship with other members of the IRAK family. IRAK2 phosphorylates target proteins involved in the propagation of immune and inflammatory signals through pathways such as NF‑κB activation and stress‑kinase stimulation (benosman2013interleukin1receptorassociatedkinase2 pages 1-3). The precise consensus substrate motif for IRAK2 has not been conclusively determined; however, substrates of related serine/threonine kinases often contain sequences that display a preference for basic residues in proximity to the phosphorylation site. For example, many kinases of this group have been reported to recognize motifs such as an RxRxxp[ST] pattern, where “p[ST]” represents the phosphorylated serine or threonine. On the basis of such comparisons, IRAK2 is hypothesized to target serine or threonine residues positioned in contexts that potentially include basic amino acids. The functional consequence of such phosphorylation events is the modulation of downstream signaling cascades that lead to pro‑inflammatory gene transcription and mRNA stabilization through the activation of transcription factors like NF‑κB and stress‑responsive kinases such as JNK and p38 MAPK (benosman2013interleukin1receptorassociatedkinase2 pages 1-3, gosu2012molecularevolutionand pages 1-2).\n\n5. Structure  \nThe three‑dimensional organization of IRAK2 is defined by its modular domain architecture, which underpins its role in both catalytic functions and the assembly of multi‑protein complexes. At the N‑terminus, IRAK2 contains a death domain (DD) that is critical for mediating homotypic interactions with adaptor proteins such as MyD88. This domain is indispensable for the recruitment of IRAK2 to the IL‑1 receptor complex, where it contributes to the formation of the Myddosome—a multiprotein signaling complex that orchestrates downstream activation of NF‑κB and MAP kinases (maschera1999overexpressionofan pages 4-5, benosman2013interleukin1receptorassociatedkinase2 pages 1-3). Centrally located is the kinase domain, which is organized into the typical two‑lobe structure observed in serine/threonine kinases. The N‑terminal lobe of the kinase domain houses the ATP‑binding pocket and beta‑sheet structure, whereas the C‑terminal lobe contains the catalytic loop, the activation segment (T‑loop), and regions that contribute to substrate orientation. Conserved features in this domain include a catalytic lysine residue that is essential for ATP binding and a C‑helix that plays a role in stabilizing the active conformation of the kinase. Although there are reports indicating that some isoforms of IRAK2 may exhibit attenuated catalytic activity due to substitutions at key catalytic residues, structural modeling based on closely related kinases (such as IRAK4) supports that the overall fold is maintained. In addition to the core kinase domain, C‑terminal regions of IRAK2 contribute to substrate recruitment and mediate interactions necessary for the formation of higher‑order signaling assemblies. Unique structural features include the juxtaposition of the death domain and the kinase domain, which allows IRAK2 to function both as an enzymatic mediator and as a scaffolding protein in the propagation and regulation of inflammatory signals (dardick2006plantandanimal pages 6-7, gosu2012molecularevolutionand pages 14-15, klausheisen2011structurefunctionsimilaritiesbetween pages 1-2).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of IRAK2 involves a multifaceted network of post‑translational modifications and protein–protein interactions that modulate its activity in response to IL‑1 receptor engagement. Following the binding of IL‑1 to its receptor, IRAK2 is recruited to the receptor complex through its death domain, where it becomes a part of the Myddosome along with MyD88 and IRAK4. An essential regulatory event is the phosphorylation of IRAK2; this modification, mediated by upstream kinases such as IRAK4, is critical for promoting conformational changes within IRAK2 that enable its proper function within the signaling complex (benosman2013interleukin1receptorassociatedkinase2 pages 1-3, gosu2012molecularevolutionand pages 14-15). The phosphorylation status of IRAK2 influences its ability to activate downstream effector kinases—including those responsible for triggering the NF‑κB pathway—and consequently controls the amplitude and duration of the inflammatory response.  \nIn addition to phosphorylation, alternative splicing of the IRAK2 mRNA results in the production of different isoforms that may have distinct regulatory properties and capacities to propagate signal transduction. Some splice variants are linked to enhanced pro‑inflammatory activity, while others can modulate processes such as endoplasmic reticulum stress‑induced apoptosis through their influence on transcription factors like CHOP (biswas2007myeloiddifferentiationfactor pages 4-5, smith2011irak2regulatesil1mediated pages 9-9). Furthermore, the incorporation of IRAK2 into the Myddosome via interactions mediated by its death domain ensures spatial and temporal control of its signaling function. Such regulated assembly is critical for enabling rapid responses to pathogen‑associated signals while preventing excessive or prolonged activation that might lead to pathological inflammation (benosman2013interleukin1receptorassociatedkinase2 pages 1-3, gosu2012molecularevolutionand pages 14-15).\n\n7. Function  \nWithin the IL‑1 receptor and Toll‑like receptor signaling pathways, IRAK2 serves as a pivotal mediator that bridges receptor activation to downstream effector responses. Upon binding of IL‑1 to its receptor, IRAK2 is swiftly recruited to the receptor complex by its N‑terminal death domain, which drives the assembly of the Myddosome together with adapter proteins and other IRAK family members such as IRAK1 and IRAK4. This assembly is fundamental for eliciting the activation of NF‑κB, a transcription factor central to the induction of pro‑inflammatory genes. In essence, IRAK2 facilitates the phosphorylation cascade that culminates in the degradation of inhibitors of NF‑κB and the subsequent nuclear translocation of the transcription factor. In parallel, IRAK2 contributes to the activation of MAP kinase signaling pathways, including those mediated by JNK and p38 MAPK. These kinases are involved in the regulation of additional transcription factors and in the post‑transcriptional stabilization of mRNAs encoding cytokines and other inflammatory mediators (benosman2013interleukin1receptorassociatedkinase2 pages 1-3, chaudhary2015recentadvancesin pages 12-13).  \nBeyond classical inflammatory signaling, IRAK2 has been implicated in additional cellular processes such as the response to endoplasmic reticulum stress, where its modulation of apoptotic signaling through the transcription factor CHOP links inflammatory pathways to programmed cell death. Expression of IRAK2 is observed in various cell types that participate in innate immunity, and its ability to regulate both transcriptional and post‑transcriptional events places it at a central hub in inflammatory signal transduction. Through its participation in multiple signaling cascades, IRAK2 not only promotes the rapid activation of pro‑inflammatory pathways but also contributes to the fine‑tuning of immune responses by modulating cytokine production and mRNA stabilization (biswas2007myeloiddifferentiationfactor pages 4-5, chaudhary2015recentadvancesin pages 12-13).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nIn addition to its central role in IL‑1 and Toll‑like receptor signal transduction, IRAK2 has been linked to the regulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress responses in cellular models. Experimental evidence from studies employing shRNA‑mediated knockdown and genetic knockout models indicates that modulation of IRAK2 levels can influence the induction of pro‑apoptotic transcription factors such as CHOP, thereby connecting inflammatory signaling with apoptotic pathways (smith2011irak2regulatesil1mediated pages 9-9). Furthermore, genetic variation in IRAK2 has been associated with differences in cytokine production, including an increased IL‑1‑induced IL‑17 output observed in certain mouse strains that express specific IRAK2 isoforms. Such findings underscore the potential involvement of IRAK2 in the development of pathogenic Th17 responses and its broader implications in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Owing to its critical position in orchestrating NF‑κB activation, mRNA stabilization of inflammatory mediators, and apoptotic responses in the context of endoplasmic reticulum stress, IRAK2 is being increasingly recognized as a potential therapeutic target. Although selective chemical inhibitors specific for IRAK2 are not as well established as those for IRAK1 or IRAK4, ongoing drug discovery efforts are aimed at modulating the activity of IRAK family members to achieve controlled suppression of pathological inflammation (winkler2021theinterleukin‐1receptor–associated pages 1-4, patra2016recentprogressin pages 13-15).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nIRAK3 belongs to the interleukin‐1 receptor‑associated kinase (IRAK) family, a group of proteins that also includes IRAK‐1, IRAK‐2, and IRAK‑4. Unlike its catalytically active counterparts, IRAK3 has evolved into a pseudokinase with specialized regulatory functions. This protein is conserved among vertebrates and is predominantly present in species that possess sophisticated innate immune systems. Within the context of the human kinome, IRAK3 is grouped with other IRAK family members that share a common domain organization, including an N‑terminal death domain and a centrally located kinase (or pseudokinase) domain. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that while IRAK‑1 and IRAK‑4 have retained catalytic activity necessary for signal propagation downstream of IL‑1 receptor family members and Toll‑like receptors (TLRs), IRAK3 diverged by acquiring key amino acid substitutions at its catalytic residues, a modification that established its role as a negative modulator of inflammation (janssens2003functionaldiversityand pages 2-3, flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 1-5).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nAs a member of the protein kinase family, active kinases usually catalyze the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to a serine or threonine residue on a substrate protein, following the reaction: ATP + [protein]‑(L‑serine or L‑threonine) → ADP + [protein]‑(L‑serine/threonine)‑phosphate + H⁺. However, IRAK3 is a pseudokinase due to substitutions in its catalytic motifs, including the absence of the critical catalytic aspartate residue in the conserved DFG motif; as a result, it does not perform classical phosphorylation reactions (jain2014il1receptorassociatedkinase pages 2-3, janssens2003functionaldiversityand pages 2-3, bahia2015interleukin1receptorassociated pages 3-4).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nIn catalytically active serine/threonine kinases, the presence of divalent cations such as Mg²⁺ is typically essential to facilitate ATP binding and phosphoryl transfer. While IRAK3 retains an ATP-binding pocket that features an invariant lysine residue important for nucleotide binding, it does not exhibit kinase activity; thus, although its structure is consistent with that of Mg²⁺‑dependent kinases, no cofactor-dependent catalytic activity has been demonstrated for IRAK3 (flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 43-47, lange2021dimericstructureof pages 3-4).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nFor active kinases, substrate specificity is often dictated by recognition of consensus motifs, such as the RxRxxp[S/T] motif observed in many serine/threonine kinases. In contrast, IRAK3 lacks the catalytic functionality required to phosphorylate substrates. Because the protein is enzymatically inactive, no specific consensus substrate motifs or phosphorylation preferences have been defined for IRAK3 (jain2014il1receptorassociatedkinase pages 2-3, bahia2015interleukin1receptorassociated pages 3-4).\n\n5. Structure  \nIRAK3 is organized into several domains reminiscent of its catalytically active IRAK family members. It contains an N‑terminal death domain (DD) that mediates protein–protein interactions essential for its recruitment to receptor complexes such as the MyD88 complex, followed by a central pseudokinase domain that, despite retaining the overall bilobed kinase fold, harbors key amino acid substitutions responsible for its lack of catalytic activity. Structural studies have revealed that the pseudokinase domain of IRAK3 adopts a “closed”, pseudoactive conformation in which the αC‑helix is oriented inward, and the regulatory hydrophobic spine is partially assembled. Notably, the G‑loop is uniquely stabilized by hydrophobic interactions—centered around a conserved phenylalanine residue—resulting in a rigid conformation even in the absence of ATP (lange2021dimericstructureof pages 1-3, lange2021dimericstructureof pages 5-6). Furthermore, IRAK3 forms a head‑to‑head dimer through interactions mediated by its pseudokinase domain, including contacts involving the αC‑helix and additional interface residues; such dimerization is proposed to facilitate its allosteric inhibitory role by stabilizing a conformation incompatible with substrate phosphorylation (lange2021dimericstructureof pages 1-3, lange2021dimericstructureof pages 3-4). Although an invariant lysine residue (for example, K192) is maintained within the ATP binding pocket, other features important for kinase activity—such as a modified DFG motif (often observed as DFA) and alterations in the catalytic loop—emphasize its divergence from active kinases (flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 43-47, li2005il1receptor–associatedkinase pages 1-2).\n\n6. Regulation  \nIRAK3 functions as a key negative regulator in the IL‑1R and TLR signaling cascades by modulating the assembly and disassembly of the receptor complex. Its primary regulatory mechanism involves inhibition of the dissociation of IRAK1 and IRAK4 from the MyD88 receptor complex, a process that normally leads to downstream activation of NF‑κB. By stabilizing this complex, IRAK3 prevents the necessary phosphorylation events on IRAK1 and IRAK4, thereby dampening the propagation of the pro‑inflammatory signal (flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 16-20, flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 20-24). In addition, studies indicate that IRAK3 can selectively inhibit the alternative NF‑κB pathway while allowing limited or altered activation of NF‑κB transcriptional programs; for instance, under certain conditions such as IL‑33–induced lung inflammation, IRAK3 positively regulates the expression of specific mRNAs, including IL6, CSF3, CXCL2, and CCL5 in dendritic cells (zho2013irak‐mmediatestoll‐like pages 1-2). Post‑translational modifications that typically regulate kinase activity, such as phosphorylation or ubiquitination, have not been delineated as major regulatory events for IRAK3; instead, its regulation is largely mediated by protein–protein interactions and conformational rearrangements, including dimerization that may be influenced by redox status through disulfide bridge formation (horne2021forwhomthe pages 2-2, su2009theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 8-9, su2009theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 9-10). Expression of IRAK3 is also tightly controlled, with inducible expression being predominantly restricted to monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, which further underscores its specialized role in modulating innate immune responses (mahmoud2023modulationofirak pages 4-6, ringwood2008theinvolvementof pages 5-6).\n\n7. Function  \nIRAK3 plays a central role in the regulation of innate immune signaling by functioning as an inhibitory modulator that prevents excessive inflammatory responses. It is predominantly expressed in cells of the myeloid lineage such as monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Functionally, IRAK3 inhibits the dissociation of IRAK1 and IRAK4 from the MyD88 receptor complex following stimulation by Toll‑like receptors or the interleukin‑1 receptor, which in turn prevents the full activation of NF‑κB and subsequent transcription of pro‑inflammatory cytokines. This inhibitory action contributes to the phenomena of endotoxin tolerance, wherein repeated exposure to TLR ligands results in hyporesponsiveness. In certain contexts, such as during IL‑33–induced inflammation in the lung, IRAK3 has also been reported to positively influence the expression of cytokine and chemokine mRNAs (IL6, CSF3, CXCL2, and CCL5) in dendritic cells, indicating that its role may differ according to the cellular context and nature of the stimulus (flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 16-20, flannery2010theinterleukin1receptorassociated pages 20-24, tunalı2023il1receptor–associatedkinase3 pages 7-9). Moreover, by controlling the amplitude and duration of TLR/IL‑1R signaling, IRAK3 contributes to the maintenance of immune homeostasis and prevents pathological inflammatory conditions such as sepsis and chronic inflammatory diseases (rhyasen2015iraksignallingin pages 2-3, ringwood2008theinvolvementof pages 10-13).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nGiven its pseudokinase nature, IRAK3 is not a target for inhibition via classical kinase inhibitors aimed at blocking catalytic activity. However, its biological role as an immune checkpoint has garnered interest in the context of cancer immunotherapy, where its deletion or blockade in myeloid cells has been associated with enhanced antitumor immunity (tunalı2023il1receptor–associatedkinase3 pages 7-9). Additionally, polymorphisms in the IRAK3 gene have been identified as predictive genetic markers for responsiveness to anti‑TNF therapy in rheumatoid arthritis, underscoring its clinical relevance in autoimmune diseases (wiese2020investigationalirak4inhibitors pages 17-21). Although no specific inhibitors that directly target the scaffolding or regulatory functions of IRAK3 have been reported, its involvement in modulating signaling complexes makes it an attractive candidate for therapeutic intervention by new modalities such as protein–protein interaction disruptors or PROTACs (tunalı2023il1receptor–associatedkinase3 pages 7-9, wiese2020investigationalirak4inhibitors pages 17-21).\n\n9.

Involved in Toll-like receptor (TLR) and IL-1R signaling pathways (PubMed:17878374). Is rapidly recruited by MYD88 to the receptor-signaling complex upon TLR activation to form the Myddosome together with IRAK2. Phosphorylates initially IRAK1, thus stimulating the kinase activity and intensive autophosphorylation of IRAK1. Phosphorylates E3 ubiquitin ligases Pellino proteins (PELI1, PELI2 and PELI3) to promote pellino-mediated polyubiquitination of IRAK1. Then, the ubiquitin-binding domain of IKBKG/NEMO binds to polyubiquitinated IRAK1 bringing together the IRAK1-MAP3K7/TAK1-TRAF6 complex and the NEMO-IKKA-IKKB complex. In turn, MAP3K7/TAK1 activates IKKs (CHUK/IKKA and IKBKB/IKKB) leading to NF-kappa-B nuclear translocation and activation. Alternatively, phosphorylates TIRAP to promote its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Phosphorylates NCF1 and regulates NADPH oxidase activation after LPS stimulation suggesting a similar mechanism during microbial infections**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nInterleukin‑1 receptor‑associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) is a member of the IRAK family of kinases, a group of serine/threonine protein kinases that share a common evolutionary origin and functional role in innate immune signaling. IRAK4 possesses a characteristic domain architecture composed of an N‑terminal death domain (DD) and a C‑terminal kinase domain, and its conservation has been demonstrated across vertebrate species. Orthologs of IRAK4 have been identified in a wide range of organisms, from mammals to more basal vertebrates, and even in some invertebrate species where proteins with similar domain organization such as Drosophila’s Pelle or Tube‑like kinases perform analogous functions. Comparative phylogenetic analyses reveal that IRAK4 represents, within the human kinome, a conserved member that can be traced back to early eukaryotic ancestors, similar to other kinases involved in Toll‑like receptor (TLR) signaling (gosu2012molecularevolutionand pages 1-2). Moreover, analyses using sequence alignments and functional divergence methodologies indicate that IRAK4 emerged as the primordial active kinase among its paralogs with subsequent gene duplication events giving rise to additional members like IRAK1, IRAK2, and the catalytically inactive IRAKM. Phylogenetic studies further support that the kinase domain and death domain of IRAK4 are subject to strong purifying selection, underscoring the evolutionary pressure to maintain its catalytic and scaffolding functions in innate immunity (gosu2012molecularevolutionand pages 4-5, dossang2016thenterminalloop pages 1-2). Its group assignment places it within the IRAK family, whose roles are central to TLR and interleukin‑1 receptor (IL‑1R) signaling cascades as originally defined by large‑scale kinase cataloging efforts (Manning et al., 2002, not cited explicitly but supported by comparative analyses).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nIRAK4 catalyzes the transfer of the γ‑phosphate group from ATP to serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins. The reaction can be described as follows: ATP + [protein]‑(L‑serine or L‑threonine) → ADP + [protein]‑phospho‑(L‑serine/threonine) + H⁺. In the context of innate immune signaling, IRAK4 phosphorylates key substrates such as IRAK1 and members of the Pellino family, initiating downstream signaling events that culminate in the activation of NF‑κB and MAP kinase cascades (hekmatnejad2010steadystatekineticcharacterization pages 1-2, wang2009irak4inhibitorsfor pages 1-2). This phosphorylation event is the critical biochemical activity that underlies IRAK4’s function as a serine/threonine kinase, thereby enabling the cascade of phosphorylation reactions that propagate the immune response.\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of IRAK4 depends on the presence of divalent metal ions, most notably Mg²⁺. Mg²⁺ functions as a cofactor by forming complexes with ATP, thereby facilitating the proper positioning of the nucleotide within the active site of the kinase. This requirement is typical among kinases, and biochemical studies with IRAK4 have demonstrated the necessity of Mg²⁺ for optimal kinase activity. The dependency on Mg²⁺--as demonstrated by kinetic assays--confirms that the enzymatic function follows the classical mechanism of phosphoryl transfer observed in serine/threonine kinases (hekmatnejad2010steadystatekineticcharacterization pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nIRAK4 exhibits substrate specificity that is central to its function in innate immune signaling. One of its primary substrates is IRAK1, for which IRAK4 phosphorylates specific threonine residues—most notably at residues corresponding to the activation loop (for example, T209 as reported in several studies) (li2023anoncanonicalirak4irak1 pages 1-3). In addition, IRAK4 phosphorylates E3 ubiquitin ligases such as Pellino proteins (including PELI1, PELI2, and PELI3), which, following phosphorylation, mediate polyubiquitination of IRAK1, strengthening the signal for downstream recruitment of other signaling components like IKBKG/NEMO (behairy2023unravelingextremelydamaging pages 19-21). Although precise consensus recognition motifs in terms of amino acid sequences have not been detailed as extensively in the currently available texts, the substrate recognition by IRAK4 is consistent with that of other serine/threonine kinases, with its active site structured to accommodate polar and charged residues that flank the phosphorylated serine or threonine (wang2009irak4inhibitorsfor pages 13-14). Thus, the kinase preferably targets substrates that contain appropriate residues required for formation of stable interactions within the catalytic cleft.\n\n5. Structure  \nIRAK4 is organized into distinct domains that contribute to both its signaling and catalytic roles. At the N‑terminus, it contains a death domain (DD), which mediates homotypic interactions with adaptor proteins such as MyD88 and facilitates formation of the Myddosome—a multiprotein signaling complex essential for TLR and IL‑1R signaling (behairy2023unravelingextremelydamaging pages 26-28, dossang2016thenterminalloop pages 1-2). Immediately following this is a less well‐defined Pro‑Ser‑Thr (PST) rich region that is thought to contribute to flexible linker functions. The primary catalytic unit of IRAK4 is the C‑terminal kinase domain, a bilobal structure with a smaller N‑lobe dominated by β‑sheet architecture and a larger C‑lobe that is predominantly α‑helical. Within this kinase domain are highly conserved motifs, including a glycine‑rich “G‑loop” that binds ATP, a catalytic loop that contains the active site aspartate, and an activation segment (or activation loop) that includes regulatory phosphorylation sites such as Thr345 and Ser346 (behairy2023unravelingextremelydamaging pages 19-21, wang2009irak4inhibitorsfor pages 12-13). A unique structural feature of IRAK4 is its tyrosine gatekeeper residue (Tyr262), which distinguishes its ATP‑binding pocket from that of many other kinases; this bulky residue blocks access to a typically available hydrophobic pocket, thereby influencing both substrate specificity and the design of selective inhibitors (wang2009irak4inhibitorsfor pages 6-8, wang2019conformationalflexibilityand pages 5-7). Additionally, the kinase domain includes a “regulatory spine” composed of hydrophobic residues that is critical for the proper alignment of catalytic elements and is rearranged upon activation through phosphorylation (wang2019conformationalflexibilityand pages 3-4). These structural elements together create an enzyme that is capable of transitioning between inactive “open” conformations and an active “closed” conformation upon autophosphorylation, a critical step that modulates its catalytic activity (behairy2023unravelingextremelydamaging pages 4-6, koziczakholbro2007irak4kinaseactivity pages 1-2).\n\n6. Regulation  \nIRAK4 regulation occurs through multiple interconnected mechanisms. A key aspect of its regulation involves autophosphorylation; upon recruitment to receptor complexes via interactions with MyD88, IRAK4 dimerizes and undergoes trans‑autophosphorylation at critical residues located in its activation loop—particularly Thr345 and Ser346—which serve to relieve autoinhibition and generate an active kinase conformation (behairy2023unravelingextremelydamaging pages 19-21, wang2019conformationalflexibilityand pages 16-18). The death domain of IRAK4 also plays a regulatory role by mediating protein–protein interactions. This domain facilitates the assembly of the Myddosome, which is required for effective downstream signaling (dossang2016thenterminalloop pages 6-8). In addition, regulation of IRAK4 extends to its influence on other proteins; for example, IRAK4 phosphorylates Pellino family E3 ubiquitin ligases, which in turn catalyze the polyubiquitination of IRAK1. Such ubiquitination events are critical for the recruitment of downstream adaptor and effector proteins culminating in NF‑κB activation (behairy2023unravelingextremelydamaging pages 26-28). Although the detailed kinetics of substrate interaction have been explored, IRAK4 regulation is also modulated by its ability to cycle between inactive and active conformations, a process influenced by both autophosphorylation and binding of ATP or specific inhibitors (hekmatnejad2010steadystatekineticcharacterization pages 11-11, wang2009irak4inhibitorsfor pages 3-4). Each of these layers of regulation functions in a coordinated manner to ensure that IRAK4 activation is appropriately triggered in response to pathogen‑associated signals and is kept in check to prevent aberrant inflammation.\n\n7. Function  \nIRAK4 plays a central role as an initiator of innate immune responses. Upon engagement of Toll‑like receptors (TLRs) or the interleukin‑1 receptor (IL‑1R), MyD88 rapidly recruits IRAK4 to the receptor complex through death domain interactions, resulting in Myddosome assembly. Within this signaling complex, IRAK4 phosphorylates IRAK1, which subsequently undergoes autophosphorylation. The cascade that follows involves the recruitment of additional signaling components, for example the E3 ubiquitin ligases Pellino proteins. The phosphorylation of these ligases by IRAK4 leads to the polyubiquitination of IRAK1, enabling its association with the IKBKG/NEMO–IKK complex and eventually culminating in the activation of NF‑κB and MAP kinase pathways (behairy2023unravelingextremelydamaging pages 19-21, li2023anoncanonicalirak4irak1 pages 1-3). The net result of these phosphorylation events is the transcriptional upregulation of various pro‑inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and other mediators involved in host defense against pathogens. Furthermore, IRAK4 has been implicated in non‑canonical signaling pathways; recent evidence indicates that following DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation, IRAK4 can be activated via an ATR‑dependent mechanism independent of MyD88, leading to the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRAK1 where it interferes with pro‑apoptotic complexes (li2023anoncanonicalirak4irak1 pages 9-11, li2023anoncanonicalirak pages 5-8). This dual functionality in both conventional TLR/IL‑1R signaling pathways and non‑canonical DNA damage response pathways highlights IRAK4’s role as a multipurpose regulator of cell survival and immune responses. In immune‑competent cells, IRAK4 is predominantly expressed in tissues with high innate immune activity and functions as a key mediator in initiating cytokine production in response to microbial challenges (wang2009irak4inhibitorsfor pages 2-3, dossang2016thenterminalloop pages 1-2).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nIRAK4 has emerged as a critical target for therapeutic intervention in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases as well as in conditions where aberrant innate immune signaling contributes to pathology. Several small‑molecule inhibitors targeting the ATP‑binding pocket of IRAK4 have been developed and are currently under investigation in preclinical studies. These inhibitors, such as HG‑12‑6 and other type I and type II inhibitors, exploit unique structural features of the IRAK4 kinase domain—including the bulky Tyr262 gatekeeper and distinct conformations of the activation loop—to achieve selectivity (wang2009irak4inhibitorsfor pages 4-6, wang2019conformationalflexibilityand pages 5-7). Disease‑associated variants of IRAK4 have been identified through in silico analyses to be potentially deleterious, compromising protein stability and autophosphorylation, which in turn affects downstream signaling efficiency (behairy2023unravelingextremelydamaging pages 23-25). Deficiencies in IRAK4 activity are causative for immunodeficiencies, characterized by recurrent pyogenic bacterial infections in childhood, while hyperactivation may contribute to chronic inflammatory disorders. In addition, recent studies have extended the functional profile of IRAK4 to include a role in the regulation of cell survival following genotoxic stress, thereby implicating it in the resistance of tumor cells to radiotherapy (li2023anoncanonicalirak4irak1 pages 9-11). These observations have spurred interest in the potential for IRAK4 inhibitors to be used either alone or in combination with other therapies to modulate inflammatory responses or to overcome therapy resistance in cancers. Thus, IRAK4 remains a protein of considerable translatable interest in the context of personalized medicine.\n\n9.

Phosphorylates MAP2K3, MAP2K6 and MARK2. Acts as an activator of the p38/MAPK14 stress-activated MAPK cascade by mediating phosphorylation and subsequent activation of the upstream MAP2K3 and MAP2K6 kinases. Involved in G-protein coupled receptor signaling to p38/MAPK14. In response to DNA damage, involved in the G2/M transition DNA damage checkpoint by activating the p38/MAPK14 stress-activated MAPK cascade, probably by mediating phosphorylation of MAP2K3 and MAP2K6. Acts as a regulator of cytoskeleton stability by phosphorylating 'Thr-208' of MARK2, leading to activate MARK2 kinase activity and subsequent phosphorylation and detachment of MAPT/TAU from microtubules. Also acts as a regulator of apoptosis: regulates apoptotic morphological changes, including cell contraction, membrane blebbing and apoptotic bodies formation via activation of the MAPK8/JNK cascade. Plays an essential role in the regulation of neuronal development in the central nervous system (PubMed:33565190).

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTAOK1 (also referred to as TAO1, KIAA1361, MAP3K16, or MARKK) belongs to the STE20 kinase subfamily within the human kinome. Its evolutionary conservation is evident by the presence of orthologs in diverse species, ranging from invertebrates such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster to vertebrates including rodents, fish, and humans (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 1-3, nourbakhsh2021uncoveringtherole pages 44-49). Within the broader context of kinase evolution, TAOK1 shares strong sequence homology in its N-terminal kinase domain with its paralogs TAOK2 and TAOK3, although the regulatory regions display divergence that likely underpins their distinct cellular functions (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 3-4, byeon2024pleiotropicfunctionsof pages 1-3). This phylogenetic context places TAOK1 among kinases that have maintained a core signaling role through evolution while acquiring specialized functions in neural development and stress responses (hu2021clinicalandneurobiological pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nTAOK1 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to specific serine or threonine residues on its substrate proteins. In this reaction, ATP and the substrate protein yield ADP and a phosphorylated substrate protein. This enzymatic reaction can be generally summarized as:  \n  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 6-7).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of TAOK1 depends on the presence of divalent metal ions as cofactors. In line with canonical serine/threonine kinases, TAOK1 requires Mg²⁺ ions for its catalytic function. These ions facilitate the correct positioning of ATP within the catalytic cleft, enhancing the phosphoryl transfer reaction (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 3-4).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nTAOK1 phosphorylates specific target proteins involved in major signaling cascades, notably the p38/MAPK stress-activated pathway. Substrates include MAP2K3 and MAP2K6, whose activation is mediated via TAOK1-catalyzed phosphorylation, as well as MARK2, where phosphorylation at Thr208 is critical for subsequent effects on microtubule-associated proteins such as tau (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 6-7, ning2025multiomicsanalysisrevealed pages 14-16). Although a definitive consensus motif for TAOK1 substrates has not been explicitly defined in the available literature, the enzyme displays substrate specificity that aligns with its role in integrating stress signals and regulating cytoskeletal stability (byeon2024pleiotropicfunctionsof pages 12-14).\n\n5. Structure  \nTAOK1 is a large protein comprising approximately 1001 amino acids with a well-conserved domain organization. Its structure includes an N-terminal catalytic kinase domain, which is essential for phosphorylation activity, followed by several coiled-coil domains that contribute to its ability to bind membranes and potentially mediate protein–protein interactions (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 1-3, beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 3-4). Structural investigations and predictive models derived from AlphaFold2 indicate that the coiled-coil region is likely to fold into a triple helical bundle, reminiscent of certain BAR domain proteins that directly interact with phosphoinositides at the plasma membrane (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 25-26, byeon2024pleiotropicfunctionsof pages 3-4). Key catalytic features include an activation loop wherein autophosphorylation occurs – notable modifications such as phosphorylation at Thr440, Thr443, and Ser181 are crucial for modulating activity and subcellular localization (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 15-20, beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 6-7). The 3D structural organization supports its dual role in both enzymatic activity and plasma membrane remodeling, with structural elements ensuring a balance between cytosolic kinase function and membrane-associated processes (byeon2024pleiotropicfunctionsof pages 23-29).\n\n6. Regulation  \nTAOK1 regulation is achieved through multiple mechanisms that involve both autophosphorylation and interactions with regulatory proteins. Autophosphorylation events, notably at Thr440 and Thr443, play a pivotal role in controlling its plasma membrane binding and remodeling activity; phosphorylation at these sites can block membrane association, thus serving as an autoregulatory mechanism (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 25-26, byeon2024pleiotropicfunctionsof pages 7-9). Phosphorylation of Ser181 within the catalytic loop is also critical to achieving full kinase activity (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 3-4). Additionally, TAOK1 is subject to regulation by upstream signals; for example, it operates downstream of G-protein coupled receptor signaling to activate the p38/MAPK cascade during responses to DNA damage, linking its activation to cell cycle checkpoint control at the G2/M transition (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 6-7, hu2021clinicalandneurobiological pages 3-4). Modulatory phosphorylation by other kinases, such as MST3, has also been implicated in regulating TAOK1’s function in neuronal development (byeon2024pleiotropicfunctionsof pages 16-18).\n\n7. Function  \nTAOK1 plays an essential role in various biological processes due to its capacity to regulate key signaling cascades. It functions as an activator of the p38/MAPK stress-activated pathway by phosphorylating and thereby activating MAP2K3 and MAP2K6. This activity is particularly significant during cellular responses to DNA damage, where TAOK1 contributes to the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint by ensuring proper signaling through p38/MAPK14 (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 6-7, hu2021clinicalandneurobiological pages 5-6). In addition, TAOK1 phosphorylates MARK2 at Thr208, thereby activating MARK2 and promoting the phosphorylation and detachment of tau (MAPT) from microtubules. This function is central to the regulation of cytoskeletal stability, influencing neuronal morphology and potentially affecting neurite outgrowth and dendritic arborization (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 3-4, ning2025multiomicsanalysisrevealed pages 14-16). TAOK1 is highly expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in brain regions such as the neocortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum, underpinning its critical roles in neuronal development and migration (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 1-3, hu2021clinicalandneurobiological pages 2-3). Furthermore, TAOK1 influences apoptotic processes by activating the MAPK8/JNK cascade, which leads to morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis, including membrane blebbing and cell contraction (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 6-7). These functional roles integrate TAOK1 into multiple signaling networks that control neuron development, cytoskeletal regulation, stress responses, and programmed cell death (byeon2024pleiotropicfunctionsof pages 12-14).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nTAOK1 is associated with several pathologies when its normal function is disrupted. Mutations leading to catalytically inactive, membrane‐bound forms of TAOK1 have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and abnormal dendritic morphology (dulovicmahlow2019denovovariants pages 1-2, beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 3-4). Functional studies have demonstrated that the dysregulation of TAOK1’s kinase activity can cause anomalous plasma membrane remodeling, which in turn affects dendritic outgrowth and neuronal connectivity (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 15-20, dulovicmahlow2019denovovariants pages 3-4). In addition to its roles in neurodevelopment, TAOK1 has been implicated in cancer biology; multi-omics analyses indicate that TAOK1 is overexpressed in several tumor types and correlates with poor prognosis in cancers such as cervical cancer (ning2025multiomicsanalysisrevealed pages 1-2, ning2025multiomicsanalysisrevealed pages 6-9). TAOK1’s regulatory features make it a potential target for small-molecule kinase activators or inhibitors, with compounds (e.g., Compound 43 in experimental settings) shown to modulate its activity (beeman2023neurodevelopmentaldisorder–associatedmutations pages 3-4, byeon2024pleiotropicfunctionsof pages 29-34). TAOK1 thus emerges as a multifunctional kinase whose precise enzymatic regulation is essential for both neural integrity and broader cellular homeostasis, and whose mutation or altered expression can have significant pathological consequences (hunter2022inheritedandde pages 15-15, hu2021clinicalandneurobiological pages 4-5).\n\n9.

May also negatively regulate cell cycle progression during unperturbed cell cycles. Following activation, phosphorylates numerous effectors preferentially at the consensus sequence [L-X-R-X-X-S/T] (PubMed:37943659). Regulates cell cycle checkpoint arrest through phosphorylation of CDC25A, CDC25B and CDC25C, inhibiting their activity. Inhibition of CDC25 phosphatase activity leads to increased inhibitory tyrosine phosphorylation of CDK-cyclin complexes and blocks cell cycle progression. May also phosphorylate NEK6 which is involved in G2/M cell cycle arrest. Regulates DNA repair through phosphorylation of BRCA2, enhancing the association of RAD51 with chromatin which promotes DNA repair by homologous recombination. Also stimulates the transcription of genes involved in DNA repair (including BRCA2) through the phosphorylation and activation of the transcription factor FOXM1. Regulates apoptosis through the phosphorylation of p53/TP53, MDM4 and PML. Phosphorylation of p53/TP53 at 'Ser-20' by CHEK2 may alleviate inhibition by MDM2, leading to accumulation of active p53/TP53. Phosphorylation of MDM4 may also reduce degradation of p53/TP53. Also controls the transcription of pro-apoptotic genes through phosphorylation of the transcription factor E2F1. Tumor suppressor, it may also have a DNA damage-independent function in mitotic spindle assembly by phosphorylating BRCA1. Its absence may be a cause of the chromosomal instability observed in some cancer cells. Promotes the CCAR2-SIRT1 association and is required for CCAR2-mediated SIRT1 inhibition (PubMed:25361978).

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nSerine/threonine‐protein kinase Chk2 is highly conserved across eukaryotes and is the mammalian homolog of the yeast checkpoint kinases Rad53 and Cds1. Its evolutionary conservation indicates that it emerged early in eukaryotic evolution and has been maintained as a critical component of the DNA damage response (DDR) network. Within the human kinome, Chk2 belongs to the CMGC group of kinases, which comprises cyclin‐dependent kinases (CDKs), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), glycogen synthase kinases (GSKs), and CDK-like kinases. Phylogenetic studies show that orthologs of CHEK2 are present in all mammals, and more distantly related organisms such as yeast contain functionally analogous proteins (Rad53/Cds1), underscoring an evolutionary relationship that reflects conserved checkpoint mechanisms from yeast to man (buscemi2014chk2kinasein pages 3-4, nevanlinna2006thechek2gene pages 5-6).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nChk2 catalyzes the transfer of the γ-phosphate from ATP to a serine or threonine residue in a protein substrate. In chemical terms, the reaction can be represented as:  \n\n  ATP + [protein]-OH → ADP + [protein]-O‑phosphate + H⁺  \n\nThis reaction is central to its role as a signaling kinase and is critical for the phosphorylation of numerous substrates involved in cell cycle checkpoint arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis (li2005regulationofchk2 pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of Chk2, like most serine/threonine kinases, depends on the presence of divalent cations as cofactors. In particular, Mg²⁺ is required to coordinate ATP binding and facilitate the transfer of the phosphate group during kinase activity (seo2003determinationofsubstrate pages 1-2, li2005regulationofchk2 pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nChk2 exhibits a distinct substrate specificity characterized by a consensus sequence that directs phosphorylation on serine/threonine residues. The protein preferentially phosphorylates substrates that contain the motif L-X-R-X-X-S/T, where “L” is leucine in the –5 position and “R” is arginine in the –3 position relative to the phosphoacceptor serine/threonine residue. This substrate preference is supported by studies showing that Chk2 phosphorylates key regulatory proteins involved in cell cycle progression and DNA repair functions, including CDC25 phosphatases, p53, BRCA1/2, and others (bell2007geneticandfunctional pages 6-7, buscemi2014chk2kinasein pages 15-16, kim2007identificationofnovel pages 1-2). Recent substrate specificity atlases using oriented peptide libraries further define the amino acid requirements surrounding the phosphorylated residue, underlining the importance of hydrophobic and basic residues in the positions upstream of the phosphoacceptor (buscemi2014chk2kinasein pages 13-14, seo2003determinationofsubstrate pages 1-2).\n\n5. Structure  \nChk2 is a 543–amino acid protein that is organized into three distinct functional domains. The N-terminal region comprises an SQ/TQ cluster domain (SCD) that contains multiple serine/threonine-glutamine motifs, which are targets for phosphorylation by upstream kinases such as ATM. Immediately following the SCD is the forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, a highly conserved phosphopeptide-binding module that is critical for mediating protein-protein interactions and for facilitating the dimerization of Chk2 upon activation. The C-terminal portion harbors the kinase domain, which is responsible for the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Within the kinase domain, key structural features include the activation loop—harboring threonine residues such as T383 and T387—and a conserved catalytic core that supports ATP binding and phosphate transfer. Crystallographic studies and structural models (including those derived from AlphaFold) highlight the overall bilobal architecture typical of protein kinases, with the smaller N-terminal lobe primarily binding ATP and the larger C-terminal lobe serving as the substrate recognition surface. Unique features include the intricate arrangement of the FHA domain that facilitates efficient dimerization as well as autophosphorylation events necessary for full kinase activity (buscemi2014chk2kinasein pages 3-4, stolarova2020chek2germlinevariants pages 7-9, wu2006characterizationofchek2 pages 4-6).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of Chk2 is multifaceted and is predominantly controlled by phosphorylation events. In response to DNA double-strand breaks, ATM kinase phosphorylates Chk2 at threonine 68 (T68), an event that promotes homodimerization through interactions mediated by the FHA and SCD domains. This initial phosphorylation event is essential for subsequent autophosphorylations at residues such as T383, T387 in the activation loop and at serine 516, all of which are required for full activation of the kinase. In addition to phosphorylation, Chk2 regulation can involve ubiquitination—the process through which its stability is modulated—and dephosphorylation by specific phosphatases such as PP2A and WIP1, which act to return Chk2 to its basal inactive state once DNA repair is accomplished. Moreover, post-translational modifications may influence subcellular localization, as interactions with proteins such as karyopherin-alpha have been implicated in the nuclear import of Chk2. Such regulation ensures that Chk2 functions in a precise and timely manner to control cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis (li2005regulationofchk2 pages 1-2, wu2006characterizationofchek2 pages 3-4, stolarova2020chek2germlinevariants pages 30-31).\n\n7. Function  \nChk2 plays a central role in maintaining genomic integrity by acting as a key mediator of the DNA damage response. Upon activation by DNA double-strand breaks, Chk2 phosphorylates a variety of substrates to enforce cell cycle arrest at both the G1/S and G2/M checkpoints. For example, phosphorylation of the CDC25 family of phosphatases (including CDC25A, CDC25B, and CDC25C) leads to their inhibition, resulting in the accumulation of inhibitory phosphates on CDK-cyclin complexes and subsequently halting cell cycle progression. In addition, Chk2 phosphorylates the tumor suppressor p53—specifically at serine 20—which alleviates the inhibitory effect of MDM2 and facilitates the stabilization and activation of p53. Activated p53 then drives the transcription of target genes involved in DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. Furthermore, Chk2 regulates the DNA repair machinery by phosphorylating proteins such as BRCA2, thereby enhancing the recruitment of RAD51 to sites of damage and promoting homologous recombination repair. Beyond its canonical DDR functions, Chk2 also plays roles in mitotic spindle assembly through phosphorylation of proteins like BRCA1 and has been implicated in the regulation of autophagy under conditions of oxidative stress via phosphorylation of E3 ubiquitin ligases such as TRIM32. Its activity has been linked to the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in DNA repair by modulating transcription factors including FOXM1. Collectively, Chk2 functions as a tumor suppressor by coordinating cell cycle checkpoint activation, DNA repair, and apoptosis in response to genomic stress (bell2007geneticandfunctional pages 6-7, buscemi2014chk2kinasein pages 7-8, smith2020dnadamagecheckpoint pages 1-2).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral inhibitors targeting Chk2 have been developed, and these are of particular interest in cancer therapy. While some small-molecule inhibitors such as PV1019, VRX0466617, and bis-guanylhydrazone derivatives have been evaluated in preclinical settings, many of these compounds also affect related kinases like Chk1, complicating efforts to achieve absolute selectivity (lountos2011structuralcharacterizationof pages 10-10, stolz2011tumorsuppressorchk2 pages 3-5). Mutations in CHEK2, notably the 1100delC truncation and the I157T missense variant, have been robustly associated with an increased risk of several cancers, including breast, prostate, and colorectal carcinomas, as well as in familial cancer predisposition syndromes (bell2007geneticandfunctional pages 6-7, stolarova2020chek2germlinevariants pages 3-5, wu2006characterizationofchek2 pages 4-6). Owing to its crucial role in safeguarding genomic integrity, alterations in Chk2 function may contribute to chromosomal instability observed in tumors. Moreover, its involvement in modulating the balance between cell survival and apoptosis through the p53 pathway further underscores its significance as a tumor suppressor. In addition to its canonical functions in DDR, emerging evidence suggests that Chk2 may have roles in DNA damage-independent processes such as mitotic spindle assembly and autophagosome regulation under oxidative stress conditions (buscemi2014chk2kinasein pages 16-16, buscemi2014chk2kinasein pages 8-10). These findings render Chk2 a key target for tailoring therapeutic strategies, particularly those aimed at sensitizing tumor cells to DNA-damaging agents (chrisanthar2008chek2mutationsaffecting pages 9-10, mustofa2020rolesofchk2chek2 pages 1-4).\n\n9.

    "answer": "Question: # Information\n\n**Protein Name: Receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 / gene: RIPK1 RIP; RIP1**\n**Uniprot Id: Q13546**\n**Protein alternative names: Cell death protein RIP; Receptor-interacting protein 1**\n**Protein Function: Serine-threonine kinase which is a key regulator of TNF-mediated apoptosis, necroptosis and inflammatory pathways (PubMed:17703191, PubMed:24144979, PubMed:31827280, PubMed:31827281, PubMed:32657447, PubMed:35831301). Exhibits kinase activity-dependent functions that regulate cell death and kinase-independent scaffold functions regulating inflammatory signaling and cell survival (PubMed:11101870, PubMed:19524512, PubMed:19524513, PubMed:29440439, PubMed:30988283). Has kinase-independent scaffold functions: upon binding of TNF to TNFR1, RIPK1 is recruited to the TNF-R1 signaling complex (TNF-RSC also known as complex I) where it acts as a scaffold protein promoting cell survival, in part, by activating the canonical NF-kappa-B pathway (By similarity). Kinase activity is essential to regulate necroptosis and apoptosis, two parallel forms of cell death: upon activation of its protein kinase activity, regulates assembly of two death-inducing complexes, namely complex IIa (RIPK1-FADD-CASP8), which drives apoptosis, and the complex IIb (RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL), which drives necroptosis (By similarity). RIPK1 is required to limit CASP8-dependent TNFR1-induced apoptosis (By similarity). In normal conditions, RIPK1 acts as an inhibitor of RIPK3-dependent necroptosis, a process mediated by RIPK3 component of complex IIb, which catalyzes phosphorylation of MLKL upon induction by ZBP1 (PubMed:19524512, PubMed:19524513, PubMed:29440439, PubMed:30988283). Inhibits RIPK3-mediated necroptosis via FADD-mediated recruitment of CASP8, which cleaves RIPK1 and limits TNF-induced necroptosis (PubMed:19524512, PubMed:19524513, PubMed:29440439, PubMed:30988283). Required to inhibit apoptosis and necroptosis during embryonic development: acts by preventing the interaction of TRADD with FADD thereby limiting aberrant activation of CASP8 (By similarity). In addition to apoptosis and necroptosis, also involved in inflammatory response by promoting transcriptional production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL6) (PubMed:31827280, PubMed:31827281). Phosphorylates RIPK3: RIPK1 and RIPK3 undergo reciprocal auto- and trans-phosphorylation (PubMed:19524513). Phosphorylates DAB2IP at 'Ser-728' in a TNF-alpha-dependent manner, and thereby activates the MAP3K5-JNK apoptotic cascade (PubMed:15310755, PubMed:17389591). Required for ZBP1-induced NF-kappa-B activation in response to DNA damage (By similarity)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nRIPK1 is a conserved serine/threonine kinase that belongs to the receptor‐interacting protein (RIP) kinase family and is present in all mammalian species, with orthologs identified in vertebrates and lower eukaryotes (dara2018thereceptorinteracting pages 1-3). RIPK1 clusters phylogenetically with other members of the RIP kinases such as RIPK2, RIPK3, and RIPK4, reflecting an evolutionary relationship characterized by conserved kinase domains and distinct interaction modules (torre2021theroleof pages 17-18). It is part of the broader serine/threonine kinase group that functions as key regulators in programmed cell death, inflammation and stress response pathways, a feature that can be traced back to early eukaryotic ancestors (annibaldi2018checkpointsintnfinduced pages 3-6).\n\n## 2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nRIPK1 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to target serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins, thereby converting ATP into ADP and generating a phosphorylated protein product (xie2013structuralbasisof pages 1-2).\n\n## 3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of RIPK1 depends on the presence of divalent metal ions, with magnesium (Mg²⁺) serving as a critical cofactor that facilitates ATP binding and proper enzymatic function (mifflin2020receptorinteractingproteinkinase pages 1-2).\n\n## 4. Substrate Specificity  \nAlthough the complete consensus substrate motif for RIPK1 has not been fully delineated, its well‐characterized substrates include itself via autophosphorylation and the kinase RIPK3, which is phosphorylated to propagate necroptosis signaling; additionally, RIPK1 phosphorylates DAB2IP at Ser-728 in a TNF-α-dependent manner, triggering downstream MAP3K5–JNK apoptotic cascades (annibaldi2018checkpointsintnfinduced pages 6-7, chen2022advancesinripk1 pages 1-2). The substrate specificity reflects a preference for serine/threonine residues within targets that engage in death and inflammation signaling pathways (li2023targetingripk1kinase pages 2-4).\n\n## 5. Structure  \nRIPK1 is a 671–amino acid protein that is organized into three main domains: an N-terminal kinase domain, a centrally located intermediate domain, and a C-terminal death domain (DD) (dara2018thereceptorinteracting pages 1-3, siregar2024theroleof pages 4-6). The N-terminal kinase domain contains characteristic motifs, including a catalytic loop with conserved residues such as the lysine (Lys45) that is essential for ATP binding and catalysis, and it adopts an inactive DLG-out conformation when bound by inhibitors such as necrostatins (chen2022advancesinripk1 pages 2-3, xie2013structuralbasisof pages 1-2). The intermediate domain harbors a RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM) that enables homo- or hetero-oligomerization with RIPK3 and other RHIM-containing proteins, and it also contains critical ubiquitination sites such as Lys377 that regulate its signaling (annibaldi2018checkpointsintnfinduced pages 2-3, dara2018thereceptorinteracting pages 1-3). The C-terminal death domain mediates interactions with adaptor proteins like FADD, TRADD, and TNFR1, facilitating recruitment into various signaling complexes (dara2018thereceptorinteracting pages 1-3, torre2021theroleof pages 3-5). Overall, the modular structure of RIPK1 supports its dual functions as an enzyme and as a scaffold in assembling complex signaling platforms (chen2022advancesinripk1 pages 3-4).\n\n## 6. Regulation  \nRIPK1 is intricately regulated by multiple post-translational modifications that control its switch between pro-survival and pro-death functions. Ubiquitination by E3 ligases such as cIAP1/2 and the LUBAC complex (including HOIP, HOIL-1L, and SHARPIN) attaches K63-linked and linear (M1-linked) ubiquitin chains to RIPK1 (annibaldi2018checkpointsintnfinduced pages 2-3, witt2017diverseubiquitinlinkages pages 5-6) and serves to tether RIPK1 within complex-I for NF-κB activation. Conversely, deubiquitinases like CYLD, A20, and Cezanne remove these ubiquitin chains, thereby facilitating RIPK1 dissociation from complex-I and promoting formation of death-inducing complex-II (annibaldi2018checkpointsintnfinduced pages 9-11, ju2022theresurrectionof pages 4-5). In addition to ubiquitination, RIPK1 is phosphorylated at several key serine residues such as Ser166, Ser161, and residues near S320/S335 (or S321/S336 in mice) by kinases including IKK1/2, MK2, TAK1, and TBK1; these phosphorylation events suppress its kinase activity and inhibit assembly of pro-death signaling complexes (annibaldi2018checkpointsintnfinduced pages 7-9, ju2022theresurrectionof pages 5-6). Furthermore, caspase-8–mediated cleavage of RIPK1 at Asp324 inactivates its kinase activity and prevents overactivation of necroptosis (dara2018thereceptorinteracting pages 3-4, mifflin2020receptorinteractingproteinkinase pages 3-4). The coordinated interplay between ubiquitination, phosphorylation, and proteolytic processing establishes an early cell death checkpoint that finely tunes the functional outcome of TNF receptor signaling (annibaldi2018checkpointsintnfinduced pages 7-9, ju2022theresurrectionof pages 4-5).\n\n## 7. Function  \nRIPK1 is a central signaling hub that integrates signals from death receptors such as TNFR1 to determine cell fate by balancing pro-survival and programmed cell death pathways. Through its kinase-independent scaffold function, RIPK1 facilitates NF-κB activation and the transcriptional upregulation of anti-apoptotic and inflammatory genes such as cFLIP, Bcl2, and IL-6, thereby promoting cell survival in response to TNF stimulation (annibaldi2018checkpointsintnfinduced pages 2-3, dara2018thereceptorinteracting pages 1-3). Conversely, when its ubiquitination is removed and its kinase activity becomes engaged, RIPK1 promotes assembly of complex-IIa (comprising FADD, caspase-8, and cFLIP) to induce apoptosis, or complex-IIb (the necrosome formed with RIPK3 and MLKL) to trigger necroptosis (annibaldi2018checkpointsintnfinduced pages 6-7, feoktistova2015programmednecrosisand pages 1-4). RIPK1 also phosphorylates RIPK3 in a reciprocal autophosphorylation process that is essential for necrosome formation (annibaldi2018checkpointsintnfinduced pages 7-9, li2023targetingripk1kinase pages 1-2). In addition, by phosphorylating DAB2IP at Ser-728, RIPK1 participates in activating the MAP3K5-JNK apoptotic cascade, linking it to additional cell death and stress response pathways (Information section). These diverse functions illustrate how RIPK1 modulates both inflammatory signaling and cell death decisions during embryogenesis, tissue homeostasis, and in response to pathological stimuli such as infection and DNA damage (annibaldi2018checkpointsintnfinduced pages 7-9, mifflin2020receptorinteractingproteinkinase pages 4-5).\n\n## 8. Other Comments  \nRIPK1 is the focus of extensive pharmacological research owing to its dual role in regulating cell death and inflammatory responses; potent inhibitors such as Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) and GSK2982772 have been developed and are under clinical investigation for inflammatory diseases including psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease (annibaldi2018checkpointsintnfinduced pages 7-9, martens2020inhibitorstargetingripk1ripk3 pages 10-12). Mutations or dysregulation of RIPK1 activity have been implicated in various pathological conditions, ranging from cancer and autoimmune disorders to neurodegeneration and ischemia-reperfusion injury, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (annibaldi2018checkpointsintnfinduced pages 9-11, ju2022theresurrectionof pages 1-2). Notable among its regulatory mechanisms, the balance between ubiquitination and phosphorylation acts as a critical checkpoint that determines whether RIPK1 promotes NF-κB–mediated survival or triggers cell death via apoptosis or necroptosis, thereby influencing cellular sensitivity to TNF and other inflammatory stimuli (ju2022theresurrectionof pages 4-5, li2023targetingripk1kinase pages 2-4).\n\n## 9.

Acts as a key effector of NOD1 and NOD2 signaling pathways: upon activation by bacterial peptidoglycans, NOD1 and NOD2 oligomerize and recruit RIPK2 via CARD-CARD domains, leading to the formation of RIPK2 filaments (PubMed:17054981, PubMed:17562858, PubMed:21123652, PubMed:22607974, PubMed:28656966, PubMed:29452636, PubMed:30026309). Once recruited, RIPK2 autophosphorylates and undergoes 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination by E3 ubiquitin ligases XIAP, BIRC2 and BIRC3, as well as 'Met-1'-linked (linear) polyubiquitination by the LUBAC complex, becoming a scaffolding protein for downstream effectors (PubMed:22607974, PubMed:28545134, PubMed:29452636, PubMed:30026309, PubMed:30279485, PubMed:30478312). 'Met-1'-linked polyubiquitin chains attached to RIPK2 recruit IKBKG/NEMO, which undergoes 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination in a RIPK2-dependent process (PubMed:17562858, PubMed:22607974, PubMed:29452636, PubMed:30026309). 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains attached to RIPK2 serve as docking sites for TAB2 and TAB3 and mediate the recruitment of MAP3K7/TAK1 to IKBKG/NEMO, inducing subsequent activation of IKBKB/IKKB (PubMed:18079694). In turn, NF-kappa-B is released from NF-kappa-B inhibitors and translocates into the nucleus where it activates the transcription of hundreds of genes involved in immune response, growth control, or protection against apoptosis (PubMed:18079694). The protein kinase activity is dispensable for the NOD1 and NOD2 signaling pathways (PubMed:29452636, PubMed:30026309). Contributes to the tyrosine phosphorylation of the guanine exchange factor ARHGEF2 through Src tyrosine kinase leading to NF-kappa-B activation by NOD2 (PubMed:21887730). Also involved in adaptive immunity: plays a role during engagement of the T-cell receptor (TCR) in promoting BCL10 phosphorylation and subsequent NF-kappa-B activation (PubMed:14638696). Plays a role in the inactivation of RHOA in response to NGFR signaling (PubMed:26646181)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nRIPK2 (also known as CARDIAK, RICK, or RIP2) belongs to the receptor‐interacting protein (RIP) kinase family, which is part of the tyrosine kinase-like (TKL) group and is classified as a non-RD kinase because it lacks the conserved arginine residue in the RD motif in its catalytic domain (dardick2006plantandanimal pages 2-3). Orthologs of RIPK2 have been identified in diverse vertebrate species, and its domain architecture is conserved across species that employ innate immune signaling pathways. In evolutionary terms, RIPK2 clusters with other RIP kinase family members—including RIPK1, RIPK3, and RIPK4—and is further related to kinases implicated in innate immunity such as IRAK family members. Its evolutionary conservation underscores its essential role as an effector in intracellular pathogen-recognition receptor signaling (lv2022comparativeandevolutionary pages 3-4).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nRIPK2 is a dual-specificity kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues. The general reaction it mediates is: ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine/tyrosine) → ADP + [protein]-(phosphorylated serine/threonine/tyrosine) + H⁺. In this reaction, ATP serves as the phosphate donor and the protein substrate – which may be RIPK2 itself (autophosphorylation) or other downstream targets – is phosphorylated, thereby modulating its activity (pellegrini2017structuresofthe pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of RIPK2 depends on divalent cations. In structures and in vitro kinase assays, Mg²⁺ is consistently used to coordinate and stabilize the ATP phosphates at the catalytic site, ensuring efficient phosphotransfer. The crystallographic and biochemical studies employed buffers containing MgCl₂ to facilitate nucleotide binding and kinase activity, and no experimental evidence has indicated a requirement for Mn²⁺ in the catalytic mechanism of RIPK2 (pellegrini2017structuresofthe pages 5-7, lethier2022structuralanalysisshows pages 7-10).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nLarge-scale kinase substrate profiling has placed RIPK2 within a specific substrate motif cluster of the human serine/threonine kinome. Although the precise consensus sequence for RIPK2 is derived from high-throughput studies, evidence indicates that kinases in its group, including RIP kinases, have a substrate motif enriched with basic residues flanking the phosphorylated serine or threonine, accompanied by a preference for an aromatic residue at the +3 position relative to the phospho-acceptor residue (johnson2023anatlasof pages 2-3). This suggests that RIPK2, when selecting phosphorylation sites, favors a microenvironment that stabilizes the bound substrate via electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic contacts.\n\n5. Structure  \nRIPK2 is organized into two primary domains: an N-terminal kinase domain and a C-terminal CARD (caspase recruitment domain) (gong2018structuralbasisof pages 1-2, pellegrini2017structuresofthe pages 1-2). The N-terminal kinase domain adopts a typical bilobal architecture seen in eukaryotic protein kinases, with an N-lobe primarily composed of β-strands and a C-lobe rich in α-helices. Critical catalytic features within this domain include the activation loop, which contains multiple autophosphorylation sites that facilitate the transition from inactive to active conformations; the DFG motif, whose aspartate coordinates a Mg²⁺ ion essential for ATP binding; and the αC-helix, whose inward displacement is necessary for forming the salt bridge between an invariant lysine (analogous to Lys47 in RIPK2) and a conserved glutamate (dardick2006plantandanimal pages 2-3, pellegrini2017structuresofthe pages 11-13). The C-terminal CARD domain is responsible for mediating protein–protein interactions, particularly with the CARD domains of NOD1 and NOD2. This domain facilitates the oligomerization of RIPK2 into filamentous structures (the “RIPosome”), which is essential for the propagation of downstream signaling events (gong2018structuralbasisof pages 1-2, lethier2023structureshowsthat pages 1-2). Moreover, structural studies have revealed that RIPK2 can dimerize via its kinase domain, forming an antiparallel configuration that is stabilized by interactions involving distinct interface regions, including the αC-helix and adjacent loops. These dimerization events are critical for proper positioning of the active site and for subsequent recruitment of ubiquitin ligases, such as XIAP, which bind across the kinase dimer interface (lethier2022structuralanalysisshows pages 1-4, lethier2023structureshowsthat pages 3-4).\n\n6. Regulation  \nRIPK2 is regulated by a series of post-translational modifications that modulate its stability and activity. Following its recruitment by NOD1 and NOD2, RIPK2 undergoes autophosphorylation in the activation segment, which, while not strictly required for the propagation of downstream NF-κB signaling, contributes to its proper conformational stability (pellegrini2017structuresofthe pages 1-2). In addition to phosphorylation events, RIPK2 is subject to Lys63-linked polyubiquitination mediated by E3 ubiquitin ligases such as XIAP, BIRC2, and BIRC3, as well as linear (Met1-linked) polyubiquitination by the LUBAC complex. These ubiquitin modifications transform RIPK2 into a scaffolding protein that recruits key downstream effectors, including IKBKG/NEMO, thereby facilitating the activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway (dardick2006plantandanimal pages 13-14, pellegrini2017structuresofthe pages 25-26). Structurally, the kinase domain interacts with the BIR2 domain of XIAP across the dimer interface, an interaction that is essential for subsequent polyubiquitination events (lethier2022structuralanalysisshows pages 1-4). Through these post-translational modifications, RIPK2 is tightly regulated in both its activation and its ability to serve as a signal-transducing hub in innate immune responses.\n\n7. Function  \nRIPK2 plays a central role in modulating both innate and adaptive immune responses. It is a key effector in NOD1 and NOD2 signaling pathways—upon recognition of bacterial peptidoglycan fragments by these intracellular pattern recognition receptors, RIPK2 is recruited via CARD–CARD interactions and forms filamentous signaling platforms. This oligomerization facilitates its autophosphorylation, subsequent ubiquitination, and the assembly of signaling complexes that lead to activation of downstream kinases including MAP3K7/TAK1, and ultimately the NF-κB transcription factor (gong2018structuralbasisof pages 1-2, pellegrini2017structuresofthe pages 13-15). RIPK2 also contributes to adaptive immunity; for example, during T-cell receptor engagement, RIPK2 participates in BCL10 phosphorylation and NF-κB activation (information section). Moreover, RIPK2 is involved in non-canonical signaling pathways such as the tyrosine phosphorylation of guanine exchange factor ARHGEF2, which further stimulates NF-κB activity via Src family kinases, and in mediating RHOA inactivation in response to nerve growth factor receptor signaling (dardick2006plantandanimal pages 9-10). Its widespread expression in immune cells underscores its importance in orchestrating immune responses against bacterial pathogens, thereby bridging pathogen recognition with inflammatory and survival responses at the cellular level (pellegrini2017structuresofthe pages 25-26).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nPharmacological targeting of RIPK2 has attracted significant interest given its role in inflammatory diseases such as Crohn’s disease and other autoinflammatory syndromes. Although the kinase activity of RIPK2 is dispensable for NF-κB activation in some contexts—with its scaffolding function being the primary driver—it remains a viable target for inhibitors that aim to disrupt its protein–protein interactions or ubiquitination events. Type II kinase inhibitors, including compounds like ponatinib, have been reported to modulate RIPK2 activity and are currently under investigation as potential therapeutic agents (gong2018structuralbasisof pages 1-2). Additionally, the development of inhibitors that interfere with the CARD-mediated oligomerization or the binding interface with XIAP presents an attractive strategy to dampen excessive RIPK2 signaling in disease contexts (lethier2023structureshowsthat pages 1-2). Known mutations and dysregulation in the NOD–RIPK2 signaling pathway have been linked to a range of inflammatory conditions, reinforcing the clinical relevance of this kinase. Further elucidation of the detailed substrate specificity via phosphoproteomic mapping continues to refine our understanding of RIPK2’s signaling network (johnson2023anatlasof pages 2-3).\n\n9.

Necroptosis, a programmed cell death process in response to death-inducing TNF-alpha family members, is triggered by RIPK3 following activation by ZBP1 (PubMed:19524512, PubMed:19524513, PubMed:22265413, PubMed:22265414, PubMed:22421439, PubMed:29883609, PubMed:32298652). Activated RIPK3 forms a necrosis-inducing complex and mediates phosphorylation of MLKL, promoting MLKL localization to the plasma membrane and execution of programmed necrosis characterized by calcium influx and plasma membrane damage (PubMed:19524512, PubMed:19524513, PubMed:22265413, PubMed:22265414, PubMed:22421439, PubMed:25316792, PubMed:29883609). In addition to TNF-induced necroptosis, necroptosis can also take place in the nucleus in response to orthomyxoviruses infection: following ZBP1 activation, which senses double-stranded Z-RNA structures, nuclear RIPK3 catalyzes phosphorylation and activation of MLKL, promoting disruption of the nuclear envelope and leakage of cellular DNA into the cytosol (By similarity). Also regulates apoptosis: apoptosis depends on RIPK1, FADD and CASP8, and is independent of MLKL and RIPK3 kinase activity (By similarity). Phosphorylates RIPK1: RIPK1 and RIPK3 undergo reciprocal auto- and trans-phosphorylation (PubMed:19524513). In some cell types, also able to restrict viral replication by promoting cell death-independent responses (By similarity). In response to Zika virus infection in neurons, promotes a cell death-independent pathway that restricts viral replication: together with ZBP1, promotes a death-independent transcriptional program that modifies the cellular metabolism via up-regulation expression of the enzyme ACOD1/IRG1 and production of the metabolite itaconate (By similarity). Itaconate inhibits the activity of succinate dehydrogenase, generating a metabolic state in neurons that suppresses replication of viral genomes (By similarity). RIPK3 binds to and enhances the activity of three metabolic enzymes: GLUL, GLUD1, and PYGL (PubMed:19498109). These metabolic enzymes may eventually stimulate the tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, which could result in enhanced ROS production (PubMed:19498109)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny – Receptor‐interacting serine/threonine‐protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) is a member of the receptor‐interacting protein (RIP) kinase family, a specialized subgroup within the serine/threonine kinase superfamily that is broadly conserved among vertebrates. Orthologs of RIPK3 have been identified in diverse mammalian species, and comparative evolutionary analyses have demonstrated that RIPK3 shares essential catalytic features with other RIP kinases such as RIPK1 while simultaneously diverging to develop unique regulatory interaction motifs. In particular, RIPK3 possesses a characteristic RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM) in its C‐terminal region that mediates specific protein–protein interactions with RIPK1 and additional RHIM‐containing signaling proteins. This domain architecture and its conservation across species place RIPK3 within a core set of kinases that emerged early in eukaryotic evolution and are pivotal for innate immune responses and programmed cell death signaling events (fay2025evolutionaryandfunctional pages 1-4, lv2022comparativeandevolutionary pages 1-3). Furthermore, studies in plant and animal systems have underscored that although members of the RIP kinase family share a common catalytic structure, RIPK3 has acquired specialized functions related to necroptosis and inflammatory signaling that are not evident in kinases with simpler domain organizations (dardick2006plantandanimal pages 10-11, fay2025evolutionaryandfunctional pages 17-19).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed – RIPK3 is a serine/threonine–protein kinase that catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to specific serine or threonine residues on its substrate proteins. The catalytic reaction follows the canonical scheme:  \n  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺  \nThis reaction is fundamental to the kinase activity of RIPK3, enabling signal transduction that regulates downstream events in programmed cell death and inflammatory responses (wu2012investigationofreceptor pages 11-12, zu2021quantitativeanalysisof pages 11-11).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements – The kinase activity of RIPK3, like that of other serine/threonine–protein kinases, is strictly dependent on the availability of divalent metal ions. In particular, Mg²⁺ serves as an essential cofactor that facilitates the binding of ATP and the proper positioning required for efficient phosphoryl transfer. The requirement for Mg²⁺ is consistent with the structural demands of the active site, where it coordinates with both ATP and catalytic residues to promote a high‐efficiency phosphoryl transfer reaction (wu2012investigationofreceptor pages 11-12, zu2021quantitativeanalysisof pages 11-11).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity – The substrate specificity of RIPK3 is defined by its ability to recognize and phosphorylate serine/threonine residues on critical target proteins within death and inflammatory signaling complexes. Experimentally, RIPK3 is known to phosphorylate the pseudokinase mixed lineage kinase domain–like protein (MLKL), thereby triggering its oligomerization and subsequent translocation to the plasma membrane to induce necroptosis. In addition, RIPK3 engages in reciprocal phosphorylation with RIPK1, which further modulates the assembly and function of the necrosome complex. Although a precise consensus substrate motif for RIPK3 has not been fully delineated, evidence derived from large-scale substrate specificity atlases suggests that its substrate recognition is influenced by the three-dimensional context provided by protein–protein interactions in RHIM-containing signaling complexes, rather than through a linear peptide consensus similar to that of other serine/threonine kinases (johnson2023anatlasof pages 10-11, licheva2022phosphoregulationofthe pages 15-16, martens2020inhibitorstargetingripk1ripk3 pages 4-6).\n\n5. Structure – The three-dimensional organization of RIPK3 is characterized by a modular domain structure consisting of an N-terminal kinase domain and a C-terminal region that harbors the RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM). The N-terminal kinase domain adopts the typical bilobal fold seen in serine/threonine kinases: an N-lobe comprised predominantly of β-strands and a C-lobe that is largely α-helical, together forming the catalytic core. Key features of this domain include an activation loop containing the conserved DFG (Asp-Phe-Gly) motif, which is critical for the binding of ATP and coordination of Mg²⁺ ions, and a catalytic lysine residue that is required for phosphotransfer activity. Structural studies using crystallography and computational predictions such as those from AlphaFold illustrate that conformational changes in the activation loop and reorientation of the C-helix are central to the transition of RIPK3 between inactive and active states. The C-terminal RHIM domain is indispensable for mediating amyloid-like interactions with its partner proteins, most notably RIPK1. Such interactions facilitate the formation of the necrosome complex, an oligomeric assembly that is required for propagating necroptotic signaling (lopez2019functionalcharacterizationof pages 69-81, mace2021there’smoreto pages 32-39, johnson2023anatlasof pages 7-8).\n\n6. Regulation – The regulatory mechanisms governing RIPK3 activity are multifaceted, involving both post-translational modifications and critical protein–protein interactions. A central regulatory event is the reciprocal auto- and trans-phosphorylation between RIPK3 and RIPK1, which enhances the catalytic activity of each kinase while promoting necrosome assembly. Phosphorylation events, especially those occurring within the activation loop of the kinase domain, are essential for transitioning RIPK3 into its fully active state capable of phosphorylating downstream substrates such as MLKL. Additionally, regulatory phosphorylation by upstream kinases, including PLK1 under specific cell cycle conditions, adds a layer of control ensuring that RIPK3’s activity is coordinated with cell cycle progression (du2021ripk1dephosphorylationand pages 14-14, martens2020inhibitorstargetingripk1ripk3 pages 2-4, mace2021there’smoreto pages 28-32). Beyond phosphorylation, RIPK3 interacts with metabolic enzymes such as GLUL, GLUD1, and PYGL, which may provide feedback regulation that integrates metabolic status with necroptotic and inflammatory signaling. Moreover, while its kinase activity is essential for necroptosis, kinase-inactive forms of RIPK3 are capable of influencing apoptotic signaling through interactions with RIPK1, FADD, and CASP8, demonstrating that non-catalytic scaffold functions also play a role in determining cell fate (martens2020inhibitorstargetingripk1ripk3 pages 4-6, mace2021there’smoreto pages 16-20, moriwaki2017theinflammatorysignal pages 13-16).\n\n7. Function – Biologically, RIPK3 is a central signaling hub that orchestrates multiple cell death and inflammatory pathways. Its best-characterized function is in the activation of necroptosis. Upon stimulation by death-inducing signals such as those from the TNF-α family or by viral infection via ZBP1 sensing of double-stranded Z-RNA structures, RIPK3 becomes activated and phosphorylates MLKL. Phosphorylated MLKL oligomerizes and translocates to the plasma membrane where it disrupts membrane integrity, resulting in necrotic cell death characterized by calcium influx and leakage of cellular contents, thereby eliciting an inflammatory response. In addition to its classical role in necroptosis, RIPK3 may also modulate apoptotic signaling in a process that is independent of its catalytic activity on MLKL but instead requires the coordinated action of RIPK1, FADD, and CASP8. Notably, in certain cell types such as neurons infected with Zika virus, RIPK3 functions in a cell death–independent manner by cooperating with ZBP1 to initiate a transcriptional program that upregulates the enzyme ACOD1/IRG1; this leads to the production of itaconate, which inhibits succinate dehydrogenase and reprograms cellular metabolism to suppress viral replication. Additionally, RIPK3 can bind and enhance the activity of metabolic enzymes including GLUL, GLUD1, and PYGL, thereby potentially stimulating the tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, with resultant increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. These functions underscore the role of RIPK3 not only as a mediator of programmed cell death but also as a key regulator of antiviral responses and metabolic adaptations in the context of inflammatory stimuli (dardick2006plantandanimal pages 10-11, liu2021ripk3signalingand pages 1-2, zu2021quantitativeanalysisof pages 11-11).\n\n8. Other Comments – Pharmacological studies have highlighted the therapeutic interest in modulating necroptotic signaling by targeting RIPK family kinases. Inhibitor studies, although more advanced for RIPK1, have underscored the potential of interfering with RIPK3’s kinase activity to ameliorate excessive inflammation and tissue injury in neurodegenerative and inflammatory diseases. Structural mutations that affect key motifs within the kinase domain, such as alterations in the DFG motif or disruptions in RHIM-mediated oligomerization, can profoundly alter RIPK3’s ability to propagate necroptosis and influence downstream metabolic and inflammatory responses. Dysregulation of RIPK3 signaling is implicated in a variety of pathological conditions, including acute tissue injuries, chronic inflammatory diseases, and viral infections, thereby positioning RIPK3 as a promising target for the development of novel therapeutic agents. The interplay between its catalytic activity and scaffold functions—where even kinase-dead mutants can modulate apoptosis through interaction with RIPK1, FADD, and CASP8—calls for a nuanced understanding of RIPK3 regulation in disease contexts (martens2020inhibitorstargetingripk1ripk3 pages 4-6, mace2021there’smoreto pages 16-20, moriwaki2017theinflammatorysignal pages 13-16).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1.

Phylogeny  \nReceptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 4 (RIPK4) is a member of the receptor-interacting protein kinase family, which has been phylogenetically categorized into a core group of genuine family members (RIPK1 to RIPK5) that share a conserved N‐terminal serine/threonine kinase domain. Comparative analyses indicate that RIPK4, along with RIPK5, is evolutionarily distinct within this group owing to its unique C‐terminal region composed of eleven ankyrin repeats, a feature that is absent in other family members such as RIPK1, RIPK2, and RIPK3 that contain domains like RHIM, death domains, or caspase recruitment domains (buyseUnknownyearinvestigatingthepkcηripk4b pages 11-14, urwylerrosselet2023functionsofthe pages 1-3). Orthologs of RIPK4 have been identified in diverse vertebrate species giving evidence that the kinase has been conserved throughout vertebrate evolution to fulfill functions related to keratinocyte differentiation and skin homeostasis (urwylerrosselet2023functionsofthe pages 1-3, lv2022comparativeandevolutionary pages 4-6). Its phylogenetic placement among the receptor-interacting kinases underscores its role as a signal transducer that emerged in conjunction with the development of complex epithelial structures (buyseUnknownyearinvestigatingthepkcηripk4b pages 11-14).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nRIPK4 functions as a serine/threonine protein kinase and catalyzes the transfer of the γ-phosphate from ATP to specific serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins. In biochemical terms, the reaction follows the general kinase reaction mechanism: ATP + substrate → ADP + phosphorylated substrate + H⁺ (huang2013phosphorylationofdishevelled pages 1-1).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of RIPK4 is dependent on the presence of divalent cations, most notably Mg²⁺, which is essential to coordinate ATP binding and proper positioning of the phosphate groups during catalysis (cuny2021ripkproteinkinase pages 3-4).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nAs a serine/threonine kinase, RIPK4 phosphorylates target proteins on serine and threonine residues; among its substrates, RIPK4 is known to phosphorylate the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6) on specific serine residues, such as Ser413 and Ser424, thereby modulating keratinocyte differentiation (buyseUnknownyearinvestigatingthepkcηripk4a pages 14-16, kwa2014receptorinteractingproteinkinase pages 6-7). Additional substrates include plakophilin-1 (PKP1), whose phosphorylation by RIPK4 promotes cell adhesion and proper epidermal differentiation (buyseUnknownyearinvestigatingthepkcηripk4 pages 14-16, buyseUnknownyearinvestigatingthepkcηripk4b pages 56-59). The kinase domain of RIPK4 exhibits a serine/threonine specificity trait that underlies its role in eliciting downstream signaling cascades in keratinocytes, although a detailed consensus phosphorylation motif has not been explicitly defined in the current literature (chirieleison2016syntheticbiologyreveals pages 7-9).\n\n5. Structure  \nRIPK4 presents a modular architecture with a conserved N-terminal kinase domain, which is central to its catalytic activity, followed by an intermediate region and a C-terminal domain that contains eleven ankyrin repeats. The kinase domain is characterized by classical catalytic motifs, including an activation loop, a hydrophobic spine, and a conserved C-helix that is essential for ATP binding and substrate phosphorylation; structural studies have demonstrated that its kinase activity is dimerization-dependent, a mechanism critical for full enzymatic activation (chirieleison2016syntheticbiologyreveals pages 6-7, cuny2021ripkproteinkinase pages 6-8). The ankyrin repeats in the C-terminal portion facilitate protein–protein interactions that are crucial for initial assembly of signaling complexes and for substrate recruitment. Additionally, the intermediate domain may contain regulatory elements such as potential caspase cleavage sites that modulate RIPK4’s function during apoptotic signaling (fransen2011exploringtherole pages 122-124, buyseUnknownyearinvestigatingthepkcηripk4a pages 11-14). High-resolution structural models, including those predicted by AlphaFold and confirmed by crystallographic data for segments of the kinase domain, reinforce the view of RIPK4 as a multidomain enzyme with unique regulatory features relative to other RIP kinases (chirieleison2016syntheticbiologyreveals pages 7-9).\n\n6. Regulation  \nRIPK4’s activity is modulated by a variety of post-translational modifications and protein–protein interactions. Autophosphorylation within its kinase domain is a key regulatory event, and analyses of its activation have shown that dimerization is essential for full kinase activity (chirieleison2016syntheticbiologyreveals pages 6-7, cuny2021ripkproteinkinase pages 8-8). Ubiquitin-mediated regulation also plays a significant role; RIPK4 is targeted for ubiquitination by the SCFβ-TrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, with specific phosphodegron motifs (particularly in the region encompassing serines 379, 382, and 383) being crucial for this interaction. Mutation of these serine residues disrupts the binding to β-TrCP and alters protein stability, thereby affecting downstream signaling events and maintaining the organization of the cortical actin cytoskeleton in keratinocytes (tanghe2018ripk4activityin pages 6-7). Additionally, RIPK4 is subject to proteolytic cleavage by caspase-8 under pro-apoptotic conditions, a modification that impairs its anti-apoptotic NF-κB activating function and thereby shifts the cellular balance toward programmed cell death (torre2021theroleof pages 5-6). These multiple layers of regulation ensure that RIPK4 activity is tightly controlled during epidermal differentiation and stress responses (fransen2011exploringtherolea pages 117-122).\n\n7. Function  \nRIPK4 is essential for proper embryonic skin development and the maintenance of epidermal homeostasis in adults. It plays a central role in keratinocyte differentiation by phosphorylating key substrates such as PKP1, which promote cell adhesion and the formation of mature epidermal layers (buyseUnknownyearinvestigatingthepkcηripk4 pages 14-16, buyseUnknownyearinvestigatingthepkcηripk4b pages 56-59). As a direct transcriptional target of TP63, RIPK4 contributes to a regulatory network that governs epithelial cell fate and differentiation (Information section). Additionally, RIPK4 activates downstream signaling pathways including NF-κB, a critical transcription factor involved in inflammatory responses, cell survival, and proliferation (buyseUnknownyearinvestigatingthepkcηripk4 pages 14-16, fransen2011exploringtheroleb pages 117-122). In certain contexts, RIPK4 also modulates Wnt/β-catenin signaling via phosphorylation of Dishevelled proteins, further linking it to developmental processes and cell differentiation (huang2013phosphorylationofdishevelled pages 1-1). Expression studies indicate that RIPK4 is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues with particular enrichment in the skin, where its deficiency in murine models results in severe epidermal defects, abnormal keratinocyte differentiation, and neonatal lethality due to compromised skin barrier function (buyseUnknownyearinvestigatingthepkcηripk4a pages 14-16, urwylerrosselet2023functionsofthe pages 10-11). In cancer biology, RIPK4 has been associated with tumor suppressor functions in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, as mutations or downregulation of its expression correlate with increased tumor aggressiveness (wolnicka2021rolabiałkaripk4 pages 8-8, buyseUnknownyearinvestigatingthepkcηripk4 pages 14-16).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nRIPK4 is subject to pharmacological modulation; recent studies have demonstrated that inhibitors developed for mutant BRAF, such as vemurafenib and dabrafenib, can downregulate RIPK4 protein levels, suggesting a potential off-target effect that might influence its signaling in melanomas (madej2023vemurafenibanddabrafenib pages 1-2, madej2023vemurafenibanddabrafenib pages 22-23). Furthermore, mutations in RIPK4 are causally linked to autosomal recessive developmental disorders such as popliteal pterygium syndrome and Bartsocas-Papas syndrome, implicating loss-of-function variants in profound epidermal malformations (kalay2012mutationsinripk4 pages 3-4, kalay2012mutationsinripk4 pages 6-7). In keratinocytes, RIPK4 interacts with structural proteins like keratin 14, an association that may regulate the turnover or phosphorylation state of keratin filaments, although this interaction does not directly affect keratin heterodimer assembly (sumer2019keratin14is pages 6-9). Thus, RIPK4 functions within a tightly regulated network that integrates kinase signaling, post-translational modifications, and protein-interaction modules to control skin integrity, differentiation, and inflammatory signaling (buyseUnknownyearinvestigatingthepkcηripk4b pages 11-14, chirieleison2016syntheticbiologyreveals pages 2-4).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nJAK1 (UniProt P23458), also known as Janus kinase 1, is a member of the Janus kinase family of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases, which also includes JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2. These proteins are highly conserved among vertebrate species and have orthologs spanning a wide range of metazoans, reflecting an evolution from early common ancestors in the eukaryotic lineage. JAK1 and its paralogs form a distinct subgroup within the human kinome that is critical for cytokine signaling, as their functions have been maintained from lower organisms through mammals (kwon2019tracingtheevolution pages 160-165, liu2017identificationandcharacterization pages 12-13). In evolutionary terms, the Janus kinases are positioned within a broader context that includes other non‐receptor tyrosine kinases, with gene duplication events giving rise to the four-family members observed in humans. The evolutionary pressures to maintain signaling efficiency and to diversify regulatory mechanisms via different domain organizations have led to unique functional adaptations. The conservation of key catalytic motifs in the kinase domain and the retention of regulatory modules—such as the pseudokinase domain—demonstrate that JAK1 is part of an ancient signal transduction machinery that is essential for immune system development and cellular homeostasis (kwon2019tracingtheevolution pages 165-170, corey1999srcrelatedproteintyrosine pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nJAK1 functions as a tyrosine protein kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation reaction using ATP as the phosphate donor. In chemical terms, the reaction involves the transfer of the γ-phosphate from ATP to a specific tyrosine residue on its substrate protein. This reaction can be summarized as: ATP + [protein]-L-tyrosine → ADP + [protein]-phospho-L-tyrosine + H⁺. The phosphorylation event generates a conformational change in the substrate protein, which is essential for downstream signal propagation in cytokine receptor–mediated pathways (banerjee2013phosphorylationubiquitylationand pages 26-29, guye2006proteinsinjectedby pages 10-14).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of JAK1, like most other tyrosine kinases, depends on the presence of Mg²⁺ as a cofactor. Mg²⁺ is required to form a complex with ATP, which properly positions the nucleotide for the transfer of the γ-phosphate to the substrate tyrosine residue. Without this divalent cation, ATP binding is inefficient, and catalytic activity is greatly diminished (loris2007exploringstructureand pages 43-46, banerjee2013phosphorylationubiquitylationand pages 26-29).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nJAK1 phosphorylates tyrosine residues on target proteins that are primarily involved in cytokine receptor signaling. Although many studies indicate that the intrinsic substrate specificity of JAK1 appears to be broad or promiscuous when assessed using peptide substrates, the actual specificity in a cellular context is influenced by protein–protein interactions and receptor recruitment. Biochemical studies reveal that peptides derived from JAK1 substrates tend to be phosphorylated by a range of tyrosine kinases, suggesting that JAK1 may not enforce a highly restrictive consensus motif. Instead, substrate recognition appears to be refined by the proximity provided through binding to receptor cytoplasmic domains and adaptor proteins, as well as by additional regulatory interactions within the signaling complex (pineda2012substratespecificityof pages 33-36, corey1999srcrelatedproteintyrosine pages 7-8).\n\n5. Structure  \nJAK1 exhibits a multidomain architecture characteristic of the Janus kinase family. Its domain organization includes an N-terminal FERM domain, an SH2-like domain, a pseudokinase domain (JH2), and a C-terminal kinase domain (JH1). The FERM (band 4.1-ezrin–radixin–moesin) and SH2-like domains work together to mediate interactions with cytokine receptor intracellular motifs, particularly the box 1 and box 2 regions, thereby ensuring proper receptor association and membrane localization (bajusz2017discoveryofnovel pages 15-20, lv2024thejakstatpathway pages 12-15).  \n\nThe pseudokinase domain (JH2) of JAK1, though structurally similar to a kinase domain, lacks several residues that are critical for catalytic activity. Instead, this domain serves an essential regulatory role by maintaining the kinase in an autoinhibited conformation and modulating basal enzymatic activity. Structural studies and computational models, including those derived from AlphaFold, have provided insights into how the JH2 domain interacts with the C-terminal active kinase domain (JH1) to regulate its function (min2015structuralandfunctional pages 1-2, raivolaUnknownyearmolecularregulationof pages 126-127).\n\nThe catalytic kinase domain (JH1) of JAK1 displays the typical bilobal fold seen in most protein kinases. The smaller N-terminal lobe comprises mostly β-strands and includes the glycine-rich loop that participates in ATP binding. The larger C-terminal lobe is primarily α-helical and houses the activation loop (A-loop), the catalytic loop, and key motifs such as the DFG motif, which can switch between active (DFG-in) and inactive (DFG-out) conformations. The hinge region connecting the two lobes provides critical hydrogen bonding interactions with ATP or its analog inhibitors. Additional structural features, such as the gatekeeper residue near the hinge and the hydrophobic spine, contribute to regulating substrate access and inhibitor binding (bajusz2017discoveryofnovel pages 15-20, loris2007exploringstructureand pages 138-143).\n\nRecent cryo-electron microscopy structures of full-length JAK1 in complex with receptor peptides have underscored a dynamic dimeric organization, in which the FERM–SH2 modules position above the inward-facing pseudokinase domains that form stable head-to-head dimers. This structural arrangement is crucial for the initiation of signaling via transphosphorylation of the kinase domains and subsequent STAT docking (glassman2022structureofa pages 3-4, lv2024thejakstatpathway pages 12-15). The combination of crystallographic and computational data reinforces the view that JAK1’s multidomain architecture is uniquely tailored to mediate both catalytic activity and regulatory control through distinct structural interfaces.\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulatory mechanisms controlling JAK1 involve multiple layers of control. Post-translational modifications, especially phosphorylation events, play a central role in modulating JAK1 activity. Phosphorylation of conserved tyrosine residues in the activation loop of the kinase domain (for example, Y1038 and Y1039, as noted in the provided protein function information) is critical for full catalytic activation. These phosphorylation events induce conformational changes that align the catalytic residues for efficient phosphoryl transfer (zhong2012tslpsignalingnetwork pages 30-36, raivolaUnknownyearmolecularregulationof pages 60-64).\n\nIn addition to activation loop phosphorylation, the pseudokinase domain (JH2) exerts an autoinhibitory effect on the kinase domain. Mutations in the JH2 domain have been shown to either enhance or diminish kinase activity, indicating that this module fine-tunes signal output in response to cytokine binding (raivolaUnknownyearmolecularregulationof pages 30-33, kwon2019tracingtheevolution pages 170-171). Regulatory proteins such as SOCS1, which binds directly to JAK1 via its kinase inhibitory region and SH2 domain, further attenuate JAK signaling by competing with substrates and promoting degradation of activated kinases (liau2018themolecularbasis pages 2-3).\n\nFurthermore, receptor engagement is a critical regulatory input for JAK1 activation. Upon cytokine binding to receptor heterodimers such as IFNAR1–IFNAR2 or the IL-2 receptor complex, conformational rearrangements bring together the receptor-associated JAK kinases, facilitating transphosphorylation and activation (corey1999srcrelatedproteintyrosine pages 1-2, lv2024thejakstatpathway pages 12-15). The dynamic interplay between receptor binding, pseudokinase-mediated autoinhibition, and activation loop phosphorylation defines the tightly regulated homeostasis required for appropriate cytokine signaling. In addition, feedback mechanisms involving phosphatases, such as SHP1 and SHP2, modulate the phosphorylation status of JAK1 and its substrates, ensuring signal termination and preventing excessive activation (guye2006proteinsinjectedby pages 10-14).\n\n7. Function  \nJAK1 is a central mediator of cytokine receptor signaling pathways, particularly those involved in the interferon response and interleukin signaling. As a key kinase partner for receptors such as the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR2), the IL-2 receptor, and the IL-10 receptor, JAK1 plays a pivotal role in phosphorylating receptor intracellular domains and STAT transcription factors. These phosphorylation events create docking sites for STAT proteins, which then undergo dimerization and translocate to the nucleus to modulate gene expression (corey1999srcrelatedproteintyrosine pages 1-2, zhong2012tslpsignalingnetwork pages 30-36).\n\nThe expression of JAK1 is widespread, but it is particularly critical in immune cells where it regulates responses to interferons and interleukins. For example, in response to type I interferon binding, JAK1 phosphorylates IFNAR2 to enable the recruitment of STAT proteins, thereby linking extracellular cytokine signals to transcriptional programs that control antiviral responses (bajusz2017discoveryofnovel pages 15-20, lv2024thejakstatpathway pages 12-15). In the context of the IL-2 receptor, JAK1 forms complexes with JAK3 to propagate signals necessary for T-cell proliferation and survival (corey1999srcrelatedproteintyrosine pages 7-8).\n\nAdditionally, JAK1 directly phosphorylates a range of STAT proteins, including STAT1, STAT5, and others, thus playing an integral role in the JAK–STAT signaling cascade. This activity is essential for mediating diverse cellular processes such as immune cell differentiation, growth, and apoptosis. The outcomes of JAK1-mediated phosphorylation are highly dependent on the precise assembly of receptor complexes and the cross-talk with other signaling pathways, further integrating cellular responses to a variety of cytokine stimuli (glassman2022structureofa pages 3-4, lv2024thejakstatpathway pages 12-15).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nJAK1 is a notable therapeutic target due to its involvement in immune regulation and its contribution to pathologies such as autoimmune disorders and certain cancers. Several small molecule inhibitors, including tofacitinib and ruxolitinib, have been developed to target Janus kinases, and many of these agents have progressed to clinical use for diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and myeloproliferative neoplasms (OpenTargets Search: -JAK1, faisal2020developmentandtherapeutic pages 23-24). Inhibitor development efforts have also been guided by structure–activity relationship studies that utilize high-resolution structural data and atomic simulation analyses to optimize selectivity and potency (kondratyev2022atomicsimulationof pages 2-4, wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 5-8).\n\nDisease associations for JAK1 include significant roles in aberrant cytokine signaling, which can lead to inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. In addition, mutations or dysregulation in the JAK–STAT pathway contribute to oncogenesis in hematological malignancies and solid tumors, underscoring the clinical importance of tightly regulating JAK1 activity (zhang2014identificationofksr1 pages 207-210, hu2021thejakstatsignaling pages 2-3). Known inhibitors have proven effective in dampening the activity of JAK1 and other kinases in this family, and ongoing research continues to refine these compounds for improved therapeutic outcomes. Furthermore, the precise delineation of phosphorylation sites and feedback regulatory mechanisms remains an area of intensive investigation for understanding both the normal physiology and pathophysiology associated with aberrant JAK1 signaling.\n\n9.

Mediates essential signaling events in both innate and adaptive immunity. In the cytoplasm, plays a pivotal role in signal transduction via its association with type I receptors such as growth hormone (GHR), prolactin (PRLR), leptin (LEPR), erythropoietin (EPOR), thrombopoietin receptor (MPL/TPOR); or type II receptors including IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, IFN-gamma and multiple interleukins (PubMed:15690087, PubMed:7615558, PubMed:9657743, PubMed:15899890). Following ligand-binding to cell surface receptors, phosphorylates specific tyrosine residues on the cytoplasmic tails of the receptor, creating docking sites for STATs proteins (PubMed:15690087, PubMed:9618263). Subsequently, phosphorylates the STATs proteins once they are recruited to the receptor. Phosphorylated STATs then form homodimer or heterodimers and translocate to the nucleus to activate gene transcription. For example, cell stimulation with erythropoietin (EPO) during erythropoiesis leads to JAK2 autophosphorylation, activation, and its association with erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) that becomes phosphorylated in its cytoplasmic domain (PubMed:9657743). Then, STAT5 (STAT5A or STAT5B) is recruited, phosphorylated and activated by JAK2. Once activated, dimerized STAT5 translocates into the nucleus and promotes the transcription of several essential genes involved in the modulation of erythropoiesis. Part of a signaling cascade that is activated by increased cellular retinol and that leads to the activation of STAT5 (STAT5A or STAT5B) (PubMed:21368206). In addition, JAK2 mediates angiotensin-2-induced ARHGEF1 phosphorylation (PubMed:20098430). Plays a role in cell cycle by phosphorylating CDKN1B (PubMed:21423214). Cooperates with TEC through reciprocal phosphorylation to mediate cytokine-driven activation of FOS transcription. In the nucleus, plays a key role in chromatin by specifically mediating phosphorylation of 'Tyr-41' of histone H3 (H3Y41ph), a specific tag that promotes exclusion of CBX5 (HP1 alpha) from chromatin (PubMed:19783980). Up-regulates the potassium voltage-gated channel activity of KCNA3 (PubMed:25644777)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase JAK2 belongs to the Janus kinase family – a group of four non‐receptor tyrosine kinases comprising JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2. Comparative analyses of the human kinome have shown that JAK2 is evolutionarily conserved among vertebrates, with orthologs identified spanning from early metazoans to mammals. The domain architecture of JAK family members, featuring an active kinase domain (JH1) coupled with a regulatory pseudokinase domain (JH2), is highly conserved. This dual‐domain arrangement, which also includes N-terminal FERM and SH2-like domains, is thought to have evolved from an ancestral kinase gene and maintained under strong selective pressure owing to its indispensable role in modulating cytokine receptor signaling (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 1-3). In addition, these N-terminal domains are critical for receptor binding and ensuring the correct spatial orientation of JAK2 at the cell membrane; they are uniformly present in orthologs across species, emphasizing the fundamental importance of JAK2 in pathways regulating hematopoiesis and immune responses (karjalainen2016interactionsofjak2 pages 8-11, mingione2023allostericregulationand pages 1-3). Tissue expression studies in mammals further support the notion that JAK2 is ubiquitously expressed, thereby playing a central role in mediating signaling events in a wide variety of cell types (kwon2022moleculardissectionof pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nJAK2 catalyzes a classic tyrosine phosphorylation reaction. In the active kinase state, it facilitates the transfer of the γ-phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to a designated tyrosine residue on substrate proteins. The reaction can be formally represented by the equation:  \n  ATP + [protein]-L-tyrosine → ADP + [protein]-L-tyrosine-phosphate + H+  \nThis reaction is carried out within a ternary complex where ATP and its protein substrate are bound simultaneously to the catalytic site of JAK2. The efficient transfer of the phosphate group leads to the functional modification of the substrate, an event that is critical for downstream signaling. Phosphorylation of receptor cytoplasmic domains creates docking sites that are essential for the recruitment and subsequent phosphorylation of STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) proteins, enabling them to form homo- or heterodimers and translocate to the nucleus (matsuda2004determinationofthe pages 1-6, babon2014themolecularregulation pages 1-3, mingione2023allostericregulationand pages 1-3).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of JAK2 is strictly dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions. Magnesium (Mg²⁺) serves as the primary cofactor that coordinates with the phosphate groups of ATP and aids in the stabilization of its binding within the catalytic cleft of the kinase domain. This coordination is a prerequisite for the proper alignment of the reactive hydroxyl group of substrate tyrosine residues for phosphate transfer. Although Mg²⁺ is the predominant cofactor in physiological conditions, other divalent cations such as manganese (Mn²⁺) have been observed to support kinase activity under experimental conditions. However, under normal cellular conditions, Mg²⁺ plays the critical role required for optimal enzyme function (matsuda2004determinationofthe pages 1-6, endicott2012thestructuralbasis pages 26-27, mingione2023allostericregulationand pages 1-3).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nJAK2 exhibits specificity for phosphorylating tyrosine residues within particular sequence contexts on its substrate proteins. Its primary substrates are the cytoplasmic domains of type I and type II cytokine receptors and the STAT transcription factors. Upon cytokine binding, specific tyrosine residues on these receptor tails become phosphorylated, thereby creating binding sites for SH2-domain-containing proteins. Although a single consensus motif for JAK2 substrates has not been uniformly defined, evidence from peptide microarray analyses suggests that the intrinsic substrate recognition of JAK2 involves residues flanking the target tyrosine that favor binding and phosphorylation (sanz2011analysisofjak2 pages 10-11, deng2014globalanalysisof pages 1-4). For example, phosphorylation events on the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) facilitate the recruitment and subsequent phosphorylation of STAT5, a key step in erythropoiesis. Additionally, JAK2 phosphorylates other substrates such as CDKN1B, which is integral to the regulation of the cell cycle, and histone H3 at tyrosine 41 (H3Y41ph), which modulates chromatin structure by affecting the binding of chromatin-associated proteins such as CBX5 (hammaren2015atpbindingto pages 6-6).\n\n5. Structure  \nThe three-dimensional structure of JAK2 is defined by its modular and multidomain organization, which underpins its dual functions—receptor binding and catalytic activation. At the extreme N-terminus, JAK2 contains a FERM domain that is critical for binding to the cytoplasmic tails of cytokine receptors. This domain is essential for the proper localization of the kinase at the cell membrane and for the formation of receptor–kinase complexes required for downstream signaling (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 1-3). Adjacent to the FERM domain is an SH2-like domain; although it is structurally similar to canonical SH2 domains, its primary role in JAK2 is to contribute to the stabilization of the receptor–kinase complex rather than to mediate classic phosphotyrosine interactions (hubbard2018mechanisticinsightsinto pages 1-2).\n\nCentral to JAK2’s structure is the pseudokinase domain (JH2). Despite its structural similarity to active kinase domains, the JH2 domain lacks several catalytic residues and thus displays only weak kinase activity. Nevertheless, it retains the ability to bind ATP and serves a critical regulatory function by autoinhibiting the catalytic kinase domain (JH1). This intramolecular interaction between JH2 and JH1 is a defining feature of Janus kinases and is essential for maintaining low basal activity in the absence of cytokine stimulation (hubbard2018mechanisticinsightsinto pages 1-2, mingione2023allostericregulationand pages 7-9).\n\nThe C-terminal region of JAK2 is occupied by the active kinase domain (JH1), which spans roughly 300 amino acids and adopts the conventional bilobal architecture characteristic of protein kinases. The smaller N-terminal lobe of JH1 is composed primarily of β-strands and contains a glycine-rich loop that is crucial for ATP binding. In contrast, the larger C-terminal lobe is predominantly α-helical and hosts the catalytic loop along with the activation segment. Key catalytic features of the kinase domain include the DFG motif located within the activation loop, which coordinates Mg²⁺ ions necessary for ATP binding, and a conserved C-helix that forms a salt bridge with a lysine located in the VAIK motif—both of which stabilize the active conformation of the domain (matsuda2004determinationofthe pages 6-11, endicott2012thestructuralbasis pages 26-27).\n\nA distinctive structural aspect of JAK2 is the tandem arrangement of the pseudokinase (JH2) and kinase (JH1) domains. This arrangement not only allows for the regulation of JH1 by JH2 but also facilitates allosteric interactions mediated through the intervening SH2–JH2 linker region. These interdomain contacts are crucial for modulating ATP-binding affinity and determining the sensitivity of the kinase to small-molecule inhibitors. The high-resolution structures, derived from crystallographic studies and supported by computational models, emphasize the dynamic nature of these interdomain interactions that enable JAK2 to be precisely tuned for rapid activation in response to cytokine stimulation (mingione2023allostericregulationand pages 7-9, kwon2022moleculardissectionof pages 1-2).\n\n6. Regulation  \nJAK2 is regulated through a combination of post-translational modifications and intramolecular domain interactions that ensure its activity is tightly controlled under basal conditions. A key regulatory mechanism involves the autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues within the activation loop of the kinase domain (JH1). In particular, phosphorylation of tyrosine 1007 is critical for releasing autoinhibitory constraints and stabilizing the active conformation of JAK2, thereby facilitating efficient substrate phosphorylation (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 1-3, matsuda2004determinationofthe pages 6-11).\n\nThe pseudokinase domain (JH2) plays a central regulatory role by exerting a negative influence on the catalytic activity of the JH1 domain. Under resting conditions, the JH2 domain interacts with JH1 to maintain a low basal level of kinase activity. This autoinhibitory interaction is mediated via an intricate network of contact interfaces involving the SH2–JH2 linker region that modulates ATP binding. Disruption of these interactions, as observed in the commonly occurring V617F mutation within the JH2 domain, can lead to loss of autoinhibition and constitutive activation of JAK2. Such dysregulation is associated with several myeloproliferative disorders (hubbard2018mechanisticinsightsinto pages 5-6, barua2009abipolarclamp pages 7-8).\n\nAdditional layers of regulation are provided by other post-translational modifications. Phosphorylation events on residues outside the activation loop also contribute to fine-tuning JAK2 activity. For example, phosphorylation of specific tyrosines within domains involved in receptor docking can modulate the stability of the receptor–JAK2 complex, thereby indirectly influencing downstream signaling events. Regulatory mechanisms also include ubiquitination and dephosphorylation, which serve to modulate the turnover and deactivation of JAK2 under various physiological conditions. Collectively, these regulatory strategies ensure that JAK2 remains tightly controlled until receptor engagement triggers the necessary conformational changes for full enzymatic activation (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 1-3, mingione2023allostericregulationand pages 7-9, matsuda2004determinationofthe pages 1-6).\n\n7. Function  \nJAK2 occupies a central role in mediating signal transduction cascades that are initiated by both type I and type II cytokine receptors. Upon binding of cytokines to receptors such as the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR), growth hormone receptor (GHR), prolactin receptor (PRLR), leptin receptor (LEPR), or thrombopoietin receptor (MPL/TPOR), JAK2 becomes activated through receptor-induced dimerization. This dimerization event promotes trans-phosphorylation of the kinase domains, which in turn phosphorylate specific tyrosine residues on the receptor’s cytoplasmic tails. These phosphorylated tyrosine motifs then serve as docking sites for STAT transcription factors, which are further phosphorylated by JAK2. The activated STATs dimerize, translocate to the nucleus, and regulate transcription of target genes involved in hematopoiesis, immune regulation, cell proliferation, and survival (babon2014themolecularregulation pages 1-3, matsuda2004determinationofthe pages 1-6).\n\nApart from its well-established role in the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, JAK2 is also implicated in several other cellular functions. For example, JAK2 phosphorylates CDKN1B, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, thereby linking cytokine receptor signaling to cell cycle regulation. Moreover, JAK2 mediates angiotensin II-induced phosphorylation of ARHGEF1, thus playing a part in stress and vascular responsiveness (deng2014globalanalysisof pages 1-4). In the nuclear compartment, JAK2 phosphorylates histone H3 at tyrosine 41 (H3Y41ph), which alters chromatin architecture by preventing the binding of chromobox protein CBX5 (HP1α). This histone modification is an important mechanism by which JAK2 can influence gene expression directly at the chromatin level. In addition, JAK2 has been linked to the regulation of ion channel activity, as evidenced by its role in up-regulating the potassium voltage-gated channel KCNA3, thereby integrating cytokine signaling with changes in membrane excitability (hammaren2015atpbindingto pages 6-6, deng2014globalanalysisof pages 1-4). JAK2 is widely expressed in numerous tissues, which further underscores its pivotal role in both innate and adaptive immune responses as well as in the regulation of blood cell production.\n\n8. Other Comments  \nGiven its central role in cytokine receptor signaling, the appropriate regulation of JAK2 is essential; dysregulation can have significant pathological consequences. One of the most well-known mutations that affects JAK2 regulation is the V617F mutation within the pseudokinase domain. This mutation compromises the autoinhibitory function of JH2, leading to constitutive activation of the kinase, and is a defining molecular marker in various myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) such as polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis (barua2009abipolarclamp pages 7-8, hubbard2018mechanisticinsightsinto pages 5-6).\n\nThe clinical importance of JAK2 has spurred the development of several small molecule inhibitors targeting its ATP-binding site. Agents such as ruxolitinib are ATP-competitive inhibitors that have been clinically approved for the treatment of myelofibrosis and other related MPNs (kwon2022moleculardissectionof pages 1-2, mingione2023allostericregulationand pages 7-9). Beyond these first-generation inhibitors, ongoing research is focused on developing next-generation compounds that target allosteric sites or interdomain interfaces. This approach, which may involve the pseudokinase domain or the SH2–JH2 linker region, holds promise for achieving higher specificity and lowering side effects when compared to classical ATP-competitive inhibition strategies.\n\nFurthermore, extensive studies have explored combination therapy approaches that target multiple regulatory nodes within the JAK2 signaling network, emphasizing the potential to modulate its activity in a more finely tuned manner. These efforts underscore the significance of integrating structural, biochemical, and pharmacological insights into the design of therapeutic interventions aimed at fine-tuning, rather than completely abolishing, JAK2 activity within pathological contexts.\n\n9.

Following ligand binding to cell surface receptors, phosphorylates specific tyrosine residues on the cytoplasmic tails of the receptor, creating docking sites for STATs proteins. Subsequently, phosphorylates the STATs proteins once they are recruited to the receptor. Phosphorylated STATs then form homodimer or heterodimers and translocate to the nucleus to activate gene transcription. For example, upon IL2R activation by IL2, JAK1 and JAK3 molecules bind to IL2R beta (IL2RB) and gamma chain (IL2RG) subunits inducing the tyrosine phosphorylation of both receptor subunits on their cytoplasmic domain. Then, STAT5A and STAT5B are recruited, phosphorylated and activated by JAK1 and JAK3. Once activated, dimerized STAT5 translocates to the nucleus and promotes the transcription of specific target genes in a cytokine-specific fashion**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase JAK3 is a member of the Janus kinase (JAK) family within the broader tyrosine kinase group. Orthologs of JAK3 are widely distributed among vertebrates, and JAK3 is predominantly conserved within hematopoietic lineages across mammalian species (oshea2009januskinasesin pages 1-2). JAK3 is grouped with JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2 in the non‐receptor tyrosine kinase class, and its evolutionary history indicates that its domain organization and regulatory mechanisms emerged early in kinase signaling evolution (rane2000januskinasescomponents pages 1-2). Comparisons with other JAK family kinases reveal a high degree of conservation in the catalytic regions as well as divergence in regulatory domains, reflecting adaptation to specialized roles in immune functions (notarangelo2001mutationsinsevere pages 1-2, oshea2009januskinasesin pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nJAK3 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of tyrosine residues on substrate proteins. In biochemical terms, the reaction can be represented as: ATP + [protein]‐tyrosine → ADP + [protein]‐phosphotyrosine + H⁺ (casimirogarcia2018identificationofcyanamidebased pages 32-33). This phosphorylation event creates binding sites for downstream signaling molecules and is critical for the propagation of cytokine-induced signals (oshea2009januskinasesin pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of JAK3 is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions, with Mg²⁺ acting as an essential cofactor. Mg²⁺ is required for proper ATP binding and positioning within the active site, thereby facilitating the efficient transfer of the phosphate group during substrate phosphorylation (oshea2009januskinasesin pages 1-2, ungureanu2005posttranslationalmodificationsin pages 11-14).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nJAK3 exhibits substrate specificity towards tyrosine residues located on the intracellular domains of cytokine receptors, particularly those receptors that share the common gamma (γc) chain. The enzyme phosphorylates specific tyrosine residues on subunits such as IL2Rβ and IL2RG, thereby creating docking sites for STAT proteins that are subsequently phosphorylated (casimirogarcia2018identificationofcyanamidebased pages 32-33). The recognition of substrates by JAK3 is mediated by distinct structural features in its catalytic domain that accommodate the recognition motif present in the receptor tails (oshea2009januskinasesin pages 2-4, forster2016selectivejak3inhibitors pages 7-7).\n\n5. Structure  \nJAK3 is organized into seven Janus homology (JH) domains. At the N-terminus, the FERM domain (comprising JH5-JH7) mediates binding to the intracellular region of cytokine receptors and is crucial for receptor association (oshea2009januskinasesin pages 1-2, wilks2008thejakkinases pages 1-1). Adjacent to the FERM domain, the SH2-like domain (typically encompassing JH3-JH4) contributes to interactions with receptor phosphotyrosine motifs, although it does not bind phosphotyrosine in a canonical manner (oshea2009januskinasesin pages 2-4). The central region includes a catalytically inactive pseudokinase domain (JH2) that plays a modulatory role by regulating the activity of the adjacent kinase domain; alterations in this domain can impact overall JAK3 function (vihinen2000molecularmodelingof pages 7-9, ungureanu2005posttranslationalmodificationsin pages 11-14). The C-terminal region houses the active kinase domain (JH1), which adopts a bilobed structure typical of protein kinases, with an N-terminal lobe that binds ATP and a C-terminal lobe that accommodates substrate binding. Key catalytic features include the activation loop, which contains tyrosine residues (for instance, Y980 and Y981) that modulate kinase activity upon phosphorylation, and conserved motifs such as the DFG motif and a gatekeeper residue that contribute to both substrate binding and inhibitor selectivity (casimirogarcia2018identificationofcyanamidebased pages 32-33, wilks2008thejakkinases pages 5-6, forster2017recentadvancesin pages 16-18). Additionally, a unique cysteine residue (Cys909) within the ATP-binding site has been exploited for the development of covalent irreversible or covalent-reversible inhibitors, providing the basis for isoform-selective inhibition (forster2017recentadvancesin pages 18-20, wilks2008thejakkinases pages 9-9).\n\n6. Regulation  \nJAK3 regulatory mechanisms involve a combination of intramolecular interactions, post-translational modifications, and extrinsic regulatory proteins. Autophosphorylation of key tyrosine residues within the activation loop (notably Y980 and Y981) is critical for full enzymatic activation, and differential phosphorylation of these sites modulates catalytic output (oshea2009januskinasesin pages 15-16, smith2016essentialbiphasicrole pages 5-6). In addition to autophosphorylation, the pseudokinase domain (JH2) exerts an inhibitory effect on basal kinase activity, ensuring that JAK3 remains inactive in the absence of receptor stimulation (vihinen2000molecularmodelingof pages 5-7, ungureanu2005posttranslationalmodificationsin pages 11-14). Regulatory proteins such as SOCS family members further modulate JAK3 activity by binding to the receptor–kinase complex and promoting ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation (rane2000januskinasescomponents pages 12-13, oshea2009januskinasesin pages 13-15). In addition, protein tyrosine phosphatases like SHP-1 and CD45 dephosphorylate active JAK3, providing a negative feedback loop that limits the duration of signaling (oshea2009januskinasesin pages 16-17, rane2000januskinasescomponents pages 13-14).\n\n7. Function  \nJAK3 plays an essential role in mediating signal transduction downstream of type I cytokine receptors that share the common gamma (γc) chain, including receptors for interleukins IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21. Following ligand binding, receptor dimerization brings JAK3 into proximity with receptor subunits, where it phosphorylates specific tyrosine residues on the cytoplasmic tails of these receptors. These phosphorylated residues serve as docking sites for STAT transcription factors, which are subsequently phosphorylated by JAK3 and/or its partner kinases such as JAK1 (casimirogarcia2018identificationofcyanamidebased pages 32-33, oshea2009januskinasesin pages 16-17). The activated STATs dimerize and translocate to the nucleus, where they contribute to the transcription of genes essential for T-cell development, proliferation, and differentiation. JAK3 is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells and is critical for the functional maturation of T cells and natural killer cells, thereby playing a pivotal role in both innate and adaptive immunity (notarangelo2001mutationsinsevere pages 1-2, ndiaye2016differentialregulationof pages 1-2). The signaling cascade mediated by JAK3 thus underpins essential biological processes such as hematopoiesis and immune response regulation.\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSelective inhibition of JAK3 has been the focus of extensive medicinal chemistry research due to its restricted expression in immune cells and its central role in cytokine signaling. Inhibitors such as CP-690,550 (tofacitinib) and various cyanamide-based compounds have been developed to target a unique active site residue, Cys909, which confers high isoform selectivity (casimirogarcia2018identificationofcyanamidebased pages 32-33, forster2016selectivejak3inhibitors pages 7-7). Recent advances have introduced both irreversible and covalent-reversible inhibitors that exploit this unique cysteine for selective inhibition of JAK3 over other family members (forster2017recentadvancesin pages 20-23). In addition, mutations in JAK3, particularly those that disrupt its kinase domain or its receptor-binding FERM domain, are associated with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), underscoring its critical role in immune regulation (notarangelo2001mutationsinsevere pages 9-9). These inhibitors and mutation studies not only serve as chemical probes for elucidating JAK3 function but also have significant therapeutic implications for autoimmune diseases and transplant rejection (forster2017recentadvancesin pages 16-18, wilks2008thejakkinases pages 9-9).\n\n9.

Plays both structural and catalytic roles in numerous interleukins and interferons (IFN-alpha/beta) signaling (PubMed:10542297). Associates with heterodimeric cytokine receptor complexes and activates STAT family members including STAT1, STAT3, STAT4 or STAT6 (PubMed:10542297, PubMed:7638186). The heterodimeric cytokine receptor complexes are composed of (1) a TYK2-associated receptor chain (IFNAR1, IL12RB1, IL10RB or IL13RA1), and (2) a second receptor chain associated either with JAK1 or JAK2 (PubMed:10542297, PubMed:25762719, PubMed:7526154, PubMed:7813427). In response to cytokine-binding to receptors, phosphorylates and activates receptors (IFNAR1, IL12RB1, IL10RB or IL13RA1), creating docking sites for STAT members (PubMed:7526154, PubMed:7657660). In turn, recruited STATs are phosphorylated by TYK2 (or JAK1/JAK2 on the second receptor chain), form homo- and heterodimers, translocate to the nucleus, and regulate cytokine/growth factor responsive genes (PubMed:10542297, PubMed:25762719, PubMed:7657660). Negatively regulates STAT3 activity by promototing phosphorylation at a specific tyrosine that differs from the site used for signaling (PubMed:29162862)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nNon‑receptor tyrosine‑protein kinase TYK2 is a member of the Janus kinase (JAK) family, a subgroup of non‑receptor tyrosine kinases that is conserved across metazoans. Phylogenetic comparisons have shown that TYK2 is most closely related to JAK1, JAK2, and JAK3, sharing an evolutionarily conserved modular architecture that includes an N‑terminal FERM domain, a central SH2‑like domain, a regulatory pseudokinase (JH2) segment, and a C‑terminal active kinase (JH1) domain. This domain conservation is maintained despite evolutionary divergence following ancient gene duplication events that gave rise to the JAK family in early metazoan evolution (min2015structuralandfunctional pages 1-2, li2017insightsontype pages 22-26). Orthologs of TYK2 have been identified in higher vertebrates and notably express robustly in immune system cell types, underscoring its specialized function in cytokine receptor–mediated signaling. In addition, comparative sequence analyses indicate that TYK2 and its related family members have maintained high sequence identity over the catalytic and regulatory domains, which suggests that critical aspects of their signal transduction mechanism are evolutionarily preserved (min2015structuralandfunctional pages 2-3, eshaq2024nonreceptortyrosinekinases pages 1-2). There is also evidence that the evolutionary origin of the JAK kinases dates back to early metazoan organisms, with subsequent lineage-specific expansions and functional refinements that now underlie their roles in both innate and adaptive immunity (li2017insightsontype pages 22-26, borcherding2021tyk2incancer pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nTYK2 catalyzes a tyrosine phosphorylation reaction that is central to cytokine signaling. Specifically, in this reaction, the enzyme transfers the gamma (γ) phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the hydroxyl group on specific tyrosine residues of protein substrates. This process can be summarized by the following chemical equation:  \nATP + [protein]‑L‑tyrosine → ADP + [protein]‑L‑tyrosine‑phosphate + H⁺.  \nThe phosphorylation event results in a conformational and functional change in the substrate protein, often creating docking sites for downstream signaling molecules such as STAT transcription factors (li2017insightsontype pages 22-26, creeden2020kinomearrayprofiling pages 32-34).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of TYK2 relies on the availability of divalent metal ions. Specifically, Mg²⁺ is required as a cofactor, serving to coordinate ATP binding at the kinase’s active site. This coordination facilitates the proper orientation of ATP for the efficient transfer of the phosphate group to the target tyrosine residue (min2015structuralandfunctional pages 1-2, eshaq2024nonreceptortyrosinekinases pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nTYK2 exhibits substrate specificity that is largely determined by its context within cytokine receptor complexes rather than a strictly defined linear consensus motif. The kinase preferentially targets tyrosine residues located on the cytoplasmic domains of receptor subunits—including IFNAR1, IL12RB1, IL10RB, and IL13RA1—and subsequently phosphorylates specific tyrosine residues on downstream signaling mediators such as members of the STAT family (STAT1, STAT3, STAT4, and STAT6). These phosphorylation events create binding sites that facilitate STAT dimerization and nuclear translocation, enabling the execution of cytokine-regulated gene transcription (li2017insightsontype pages 9-14, creeden2020kinomearrayprofiling pages 32-34, eshaq2024nonreceptortyrosinekinases pages 33-34).\n\n5. Structure  \nTYK2 exhibits a well-defined and modular domain organization characteristic of the JAK family. At its N‑terminus lies the FERM domain, which mediates the interaction with the intracellular regions of cytokine receptors and is critical for the localization of TYK2 to receptor complexes. Adjacent to the FERM domain is an SH2‑like domain, which, despite its divergence from canonical SH2 domains, contributes to protein–protein interactions and the overall structural integrity of the molecule (wallweber2014structuralbasisof pages 1-8, min2015structuralandfunctional pages 1-2).  \nCentrally, TYK2 contains a pseudokinase domain (JH2) that, although lacking some of the canonical residues required for catalytic activity, plays a crucial regulatory role. The JH2 domain binds ATP in a non‑canonical conformation and serves as an autoinhibitory module that maintains the kinase domain in a suppressed state under resting conditions (niranjan2014functionalcharacterizationofa pages 27-30, mingione2023allostericregulationand pages 1-3).  \nAt the C‑terminus, the kinase domain (JH1) exhibits the typical bilobal structure seen in protein kinases. The N‑terminal lobe of the kinase domain contains a glycine‑rich loop that is essential for ATP binding, whereas the larger C‑terminal lobe houses the substrate‑binding cleft. Within the kinase domain, key structural elements include the activation loop—which undergoes phosphorylation-induced conformational changes to allow substrate access—the C‑helix, which positions catalytic residues appropriately, and a hydrophobic regulatory spine that is essential for maintaining catalytic competence (mingione2023allostericregulationand pages 7-9, niranjan2014functionalcharacterizationof pages 38-41, wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 17-21).  \nExperimental crystal structures and computational modeling, such as those provided by AlphaFold, have validated this domain architecture and have shown that, in the basal state, the JH2 domain adopts an autoinhibited conformation that restrains the catalytic activity of the JH1 domain. Upon receptor engagement and subsequent conformational changes, these autoinhibitory constraints are relieved, thereby permitting full activation of the catalytic function (niranjan2014functionalcharacterizationof pages 41-46, wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 17-21).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of TYK2 is governed by a series of phosphorylation events and conformational changes that modulate its enzymatic activity. Under resting conditions, the pseudokinase (JH2) domain exerts an autoinhibitory effect on the adjacent kinase domain (JH1) by stabilizing an inactive conformation. Critical phosphorylation events occur within the activation loop of the kinase domain; the phosphorylation of these tyrosine residues results in a reorientation of the activation loop along with the repositioning of the C‑helix, thereby aligning the catalytic residues to facilitate efficient substrate phosphorylation (niranjan2014functionalcharacterizationof pages 38-41, wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 17-21).  \nIn addition to autophosphorylation, TYK2 activity is further regulated by trans‑phosphorylation events mediated by associated kinases within the cytokine receptor complexes. For example, following cytokine binding to its receptor, TYK2 phosphorylates receptor subunits which in turn serve as recruitment platforms for STAT transcription factors. Once docked, the STAT proteins can be phosphorylated either by TYK2 directly or in tandem with its partnering kinases such as JAK1 or JAK2 (borcherding2021tyk2incancer pages 8-10, creeden2020kinomearrayprofiling pages 18-22).  \nBeyond these phosphorylation events, post‑translational modifications at secondary regulatory sites also contribute to the modulation of TYK2’s activity. One notable regulatory mechanism involves the selective phosphorylation of STAT3 by TYK2 at a tyrosine residue that is distinct from the canonical activation site, resulting in a unique inhibitory effect on STAT3 function (eshaq2024nonreceptortyrosinekinases pages 33-34, nor sohn2013arestrictedrole pages 2-3). Thus, the activation state of TYK2 is determined by a delicate balance of phosphorylation-induced conformational changes, relief of pseudokinase-mediated autoinhibition, and additional protein–protein interactions within the receptor complexes (niranjan2014functionalcharacterizationofa pages 27-30, wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 21-24).\n\n7. Function  \nTYK2 functions as a central mediator of multiple cytokine and interferon signaling pathways that are essential for orchestrating immune responses. Upon binding of cytokines such as type I interferons (IFN‑α/β) or interleukins (including IL‑12, IL‑10, and IL‑13), heterodimeric receptor complexes are formed. In these complexes, one receptor chain is constitutively bound by TYK2 (for example, IFNAR1, IL12RB1, IL10RB, or IL13RA1), while the complementary chain is typically associated with another JAK family member (commonly JAK1 or JAK2) (borcherding2021tyk2incancer pages 1-2, muromoto2021therapeuticadvantageof pages 1-2).  \nFollowing cytokine binding and receptor dimerization, TYK2 becomes activated via phosphorylation and, in turn, phosphorylates tyrosine residues on the cytoplasmic domains of the receptor subunits. These phosphorylated sites act as docking platforms for STAT transcription factors. Subsequently, the recruited STATs are phosphorylated—either directly by TYK2 or collaboratively with its partner kinases—leading to their dimerization and translocation into the nucleus where they mediate the transcription of genes involved in immune modulation, cell proliferation, and differentiation (borcherding2021tyk2incancer pages 8-10, creeden2020kinomearrayprofiling pages 18-22).  \nMoreover, TYK2 plays an additional regulatory role in fine‑tuning cytokine responses. It has been demonstrated that TYK2 can selectively phosphorylate a particular tyrosine residue on STAT3, thereby attenuating STAT3 activity. This action serves as an additional level of control in cytokine signaling pathways, helping to maintain immune homeostasis and preventing excessive inflammatory responses (eshaq2024nonreceptortyrosinekinases pages 33-34, borcherding2021tyk2incancer pages 18-20).  \nThe broad expression pattern of TYK2, especially in immune cells, reflects its fundamental role in both innate and adaptive immunity. TYK2-dependent signaling cascades are instrumental in host defense against pathogens, and dysregulation of TYK2 activity has been linked to aberrant immune responses in autoimmune and inflammatory disorders (borcherding2021tyk2incancer pages 1-2, muromoto2021therapeuticadvantageof pages 1-2).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nTYK2 has attracted considerable interest as a therapeutic target owing to its pivotal role in mediating the signaling cascades that underlie various immune‑mediated inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, and other autoimmune conditions. Selective inhibitors that target TYK2—particularly those that bind to the pseudokinase (JH2) domain—offer promising strategies to attenuate aberrant cytokine signaling with potentially reduced side effects compared to pan‑JAK inhibitors. For instance, allosteric inhibitors like deucravacitinib stabilize the autoinhibited conformation of TYK2 by binding to the JH2 domain, thereby preventing the conformational rearrangements required for full activation of the kinase domain (wang2025atripleactioninhibitory pages 1-5, rusinol2023tyk2targetingin pages 1-3).  \nIn clinical studies, genetic variants in TYK2 have been linked to altered cytokine responses, which in turn correlate with susceptibility to immune‑mediated inflammatory diseases. These disease‑associated variants underscore the clinical relevance of precisely modulating TYK2 activity. Furthermore, TYK2 not only functions catalytically but also serves a structural role in maintaining the integrity and surface expression of cytokine receptors, thereby acting as a critical scaffold within receptor complexes (borcherding2021tyk2incancer pages 2-3, sohn2013arestrictedrole pages 1-2).  \nA number of selective TYK2 inhibitors, including those undergoing clinical evaluation, indicate that targeting TYK2 can modulate key pathogenic pathways without broadly suppressing the immune system. The clinical benefits observed with such inhibitors support ongoing drug discovery efforts aimed at achieving the optimal balance between efficacy and safety in treating autoimmune and chronic inflammatory disorders (chen2023anovelhighly pages 1-2, liang2013leadidentificationof pages 1-2).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny – TRPM6 is a member of the transient receptor potential melastatin (TRPM) subfamily of cation channels, an evolutionarily conserved group widely distributed among vertebrates, and its orthologs have been identified across various mammalian species (fleig2004thetrpmion pages 4-5). It is phylogenetically grouped together with TRPM7 due to their high sequence similarity, particularly in the transmembrane and C-terminal α-kinase domains, which distinguishes them from other TRPM channels (samanta2018transientreceptorpotential pages 10-13). TRPM6 and its close paralog TRPM7 belong to a distinct subgroup within the TRPM family characterized by dual functionality, combining ion conduction with intrinsic kinase activity (runnels2011trpm6andtrpm7 pages 1-2). Comparative evolutionary studies indicate that these channel-kinases emerged from an ancient duplication event in the TRPM lineage, and they have retained conserved domains such as the TRP box and coiled-coil assembly motifs, which underscores their evolutionary conservation and functional importance (fleig2004thetrpmion pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed – The kinase domain of TRPM6 catalyzes phosphorylation reactions by transferring a phosphate group from ATP to serine and/or threonine residues on substrate proteins, and thus the general reaction can be represented as: ATP + [protein]–(Ser/Thr) → ADP + [protein]–(Ser/Thr-phosphate) + H⁺ (ryazanova2004characterizationofthe pages 6-7).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements – The catalytic activity of TRPM6’s kinase domain depends on divalent metal ions as essential cofactors, with Mg²⁺ being required for optimal ATP binding and phosphoryl transfer, and in some contexts Mn²⁺ may substitute as a cofactor though with differing efficacy (ryazanova2004characterizationofthe pages 6-7).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity – Although detailed consensus substrate motifs for TRPM6 have not been fully elucidated in the available literature, its kinase domain is classified as an atypical α-kinase; such kinases typically target serine and threonine residues located within α-helical regions of protein substrates (harteneck2005functionandpharmacology pages 3-5). Experimental studies indicate that TRPM6, like its homolog TRPM7, phosphorylates substrates involved in cytoskeletal regulation and other intracellular signaling processes, although a precise amino acid consensus motif remains to be determined (runnels2011trpm6andtrpm7 pages 3-4).\n\n5. Structure – TRPM6 is a bifunctional protein that exhibits a modular architecture comprising an extensive N-terminal cytosolic domain, six transmembrane helices (S1–S6) with a pore loop located between S5 and S6 that confers ion selectivity, and a C-terminal region that includes conserved coiled-coil domains and an atypical α-kinase domain (fleig2004thetrpmion pages 4-5). The transmembrane domain shows structural organization that is reminiscent of voltage-gated cation channels, wherein the S4 segment may function as a voltage-sensing element despite the protein exhibiting largely constitutive activity (nilius2014mammaliantransientreceptor pages 511-513). The kinase domain, fused at the C-terminus, adopts an α-kinase fold that is structurally distinct from conventional serine/threonine kinases; key catalytic residues and a zinc-binding module within the kinase domain contribute to its enzymatic function and stability (nilius2014mammaliantransientreceptor pages 508-511). Unique to TRPM6 is the integration of its channel and kinase domains into a single polypeptide, enabling it to potentially couple ion flux with immediate downstream phosphorylation events, an arrangement that is conserved in TRPM7 as well (runnels2011trpm6andtrpm7 pages 4-5).\n\n6. Regulation – TRPM6 is regulated by several intracellular and extracellular signals that modulate both its channel and kinase activities; intracellular Mg²⁺ and Mg·ATP levels exert a negative regulatory influence on channel gating, thereby controlling divalent cation permeability (fleig2004thetrpmion pages 2-3). Furthermore, receptor-mediated signaling pathways, including those activated by epidermal growth factor (EGF), can upregulate TRPM6 expression and enhance its trafficking to the plasma membrane, which is critical for its function in epithelial Mg²⁺ absorption (jimenez2020trpmchannelsin pages 47-49). The kinase domain itself undergoes extensive autophosphorylation, and interactions with regulatory proteins such as RACK1 and the repressor of estrogen receptor activity (REA) have been shown to modulate channel activity through inhibitory protein–protein interactions (runnels2011trpm6andtrpm7 pages 5-6). In addition, signaling molecules that deplete phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP₂) such as activated phospholipase C can inhibit TRPM6 channel function, thereby linking receptor activation to alterations in Mg²⁺ homeostasis (fleig2004thetrpmion pages 6-7).\n\n7. Function – TRPM6 plays a crucial role in maintaining systemic magnesium homeostasis primarily through its function in epithelial Mg²⁺ transport in the kidney and gut; its activity underlies the active absorption of Mg²⁺ from the intestinal lumen and contributes to renal reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule (fleig2004thetrpmion pages 4-5). The protein’s dual functionality enables it to both conduct Mg²⁺ through its ion channel pore and modulate downstream signaling pathways via its kinase activity, aspects that are essential for cellular magnesium balance and overall metabolic regulation (jimenez2020trpmchannelsin pages 25-27). Loss-of-function mutations in TRPM6 are directly linked to the autosomal recessive disorder familial hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia, a condition characterized by impaired intestinal and renal Mg²⁺ transport, which underscores the protein’s importance in mineral homeostasis (nilius2007transientreceptorpotential pages 12-13). TRPM6 is predominantly expressed in colon and kidney epithelia, and its proper function is necessary for sustaining physiological levels of Mg²⁺ required for numerous enzymatic processes and general cellular function (harteneck2005functionandpharmacology pages 7-8).\n\n8. Other Comments – Although debate remains regarding whether TRPM6 forms fully functional homomeric channels in isolation or predominantly operates as a component of heteromeric TRPM6–TRPM7 complexes, the current consensus indicates that channel assembly and plasma membrane localization may be more efficient in the heteromeric state (fleig2004thetrpmion pages 6-7, nilius2014mammaliantransientreceptor pages 520-523). Several inhibitors known to affect related TRPM channels, such as ruthenium red and rottlerin, have been observed to modulate TRPM6 activity, although selective pharmacological tools that target TRPM6 specifically remain underdeveloped (runnels2011trpm6andtrpm7 pages 8-9). Mutations in TRPM6 that impair either channel conductance or kinase activity are associated with severe magnesium deficiency syndromes, and ongoing research continues to elucidate the mechanistic details of how such mutations disrupt its dual functions (nilius2007transientreceptorpotential pages 4-5, runnels2011trpm6andtrpm7 pages 9-10). No definitive consensus sequence for substrate recognition by the TRPM6 kinase domain has been established, and further biochemical studies are required to fully map its phosphorylation targets (harteneck2005functionandpharmacology pages 3-5).\n\n9.

The channel is highly permeable to divalent cations, specifically calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+) and zinc (Zn2+) and mediates their influx (PubMed:11385574, PubMed:12887921, PubMed:15485879, PubMed:24316671, PubMed:35561741, PubMed:36027648).

The C-terminal alpha-kinase domain autophosphorylates cytoplasmic residues of TRPM7 (PubMed:18365021). In vivo, TRPM7 phosphorylates SMAD2, suggesting that TRPM7 kinase may play a role in activating SMAD signaling pathways. In vitro, TRPM7 kinase phosphorylates ANXA1 (annexin A1), myosin II isoforms and a variety of proteins with diverse cellular functions (PubMed:15485879, PubMed:18394644)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTRPM7 is a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel superfamily that falls within the melastatin (TRPM) subfamily, a group known for combining channel and kinase functions. It is evolutionarily conserved across vertebrate species and shares a high degree of sequence similarity with its closest homolog TRPM6, which likely diverged from a common ancestral TRPM gene early in vertebrate evolution (chubanov2005emergingrolesof pages 1-2). Phylogenetic analyses place TRPM7 within an evolutionary clade comprising proteins that serve as molecular sensors for divalent cations and participate in cell signaling, in alignment with kinase families that include classical serine/threonine kinases (middelbeek2010thealphakinasefamily pages 7-8). Its domain architecture and sequence conservation support its classification as a “chanzyme,” an ion channel equipped with an intrinsic alpha-kinase domain, situating TRPM7 in a unique branch of the eukaryotic kinome that is broadly conserved from fish to mammals (owsianik2006structure–functionrelationshipof pages 7-9, clapham2001thetrpion pages 7-8).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nThe kinase activity of TRPM7 catalyzes the transfer of the γ-phosphate group from ATP to specific serine and threonine residues on protein substrates. The chemical reaction can be summarized as:  \n  ATP + [protein] – (L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein] – (L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺  \nThis reaction underpins the phosphorylation cascade mediated by TRPM7’s C-terminal kinase domain (chubanov2012theemergingrole pages 139-141).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of the TRPM7 kinase domain is dependent on divalent cations, with Mg²⁺ serving as a critical cofactor. In the presence of Mg²⁺, TRPM7 utilizes ATP to phosphorylate its substrates, and both Mg²⁺ and Mg·ATP act as regulatory cofactors that inhibit the ion channel activity of TRPM7, thereby coupling ion conductance with its enzymatic function (chubanov2012theemergingrole pages 134-137).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nTRPM7 phosphorylates a variety of downstream targets including SMAD2, annexin A1, and various isoforms of myosin II, indicating that it recognizes serine/threonine residues within a context favorable to kinase activity. The kinase domain, which aligns with the atypical α-kinase family, tends to phosphorylate residues located within alpha-helical regions of substrate proteins. Although a distinct consensus motif has not been as thoroughly defined as in some classical kinases, the substrates of TRPM7 generally contain multiple serine/threonine sites, and its in vitro substrate specificity supports a broad but selective repertoire in phosphorylating proteins involved in cytoskeletal dynamics and signal transduction (chubanov2012theemergingrole pages 141-143, clapham2001thetrpion pages 8-9).\n\n5. Structure  \nTRPM7 exhibits a composite structure that integrates an ion channel domain with an intracellular kinase domain. The ion channel portion is organized into six transmembrane helices (designated S1–S6) including a pore loop between S5 and S6 that is essential for ion permeability of divalent cations such as Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, and Zn²⁺ (clapham2001thetrpion pages 7-8). Adjacent to the transmembrane segments, a conserved TRP domain is present near the C-terminus, which along with a coiled-coil region, facilitates subunit assembly into tetrameric complexes. The large intracellular N-terminal and C-terminal domains of TRPM7 contain regulatory motifs; most notably, the extreme C-terminus houses an atypical alpha-kinase domain that can autophosphorylate and phosphorylate other proteins. Key structural elements of the kinase include a nucleotide-binding region and a zinc-binding motif that is critical for its enzymatic activity, while the channel domain contains residues essential for ion selectivity and gating (owsianik2006structure–functionrelationshipof pages 6-7, clapham2001thetrpion pages 8-9).\n\n6. Regulation  \nTRPM7 is under complex regulation that integrates its roles in ion conductance and kinase signaling. The channel portion is inhibited by intracellular Mg²⁺ and Mg·ATP, providing a feedback mechanism that links the metabolic state of the cell with ion flux (chubanov2012theemergingrole pages 134-137). In addition, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP₂) interactions are critical for channel gating; depletion of PIP₂, as can occur following phospholipase C activation, diminishes channel activity. Autophosphorylation of the kinase domain also regulates its catalytic function and may influence the coupling between the channel and kinase activities. Moreover, proteolytic cleavage of the kinase domain has been reported, with the cleaved fragment translocating to the nucleus to participate in additional signaling events. These post-translational modifications underscore the multifaceted regulatory mechanisms governing TRPM7 function and ensure tight control over its dual activity (chubanov2012theemergingrole pages 139-141, clapham2001thetrpion pages 7-8).\n\n7. Function  \nTRPM7 is a bifunctional protein that plays a central role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating divalent cation influx and subsequently modulating intracellular signaling pathways. Its ion channel activity is critical for the uptake of Mg²⁺, Ca²⁺, and Zn²⁺, which are essential for numerous cellular processes including enzyme activation, cytoskeletal organization, and energy metabolism. The kinase activity of TRPM7 enables it to phosphorylate substrates such as SMAD2, annexin A1, and various myosin II isoforms, thereby influencing cell motility, proliferation, and differentiation. Expression of TRPM7 is ubiquitous, and its function is vital during embryonic development, for immune cell function, and in the regulation of cell survival. In vivo studies have demonstrated that disruption of TRPM7 function leads to severe developmental defects and impaired Mg²⁺ homeostasis, underscoring its importance in physiological mineral ion transport and signal transduction (chubanov2012theemergingrole pages 141-143, nishida2006trpchannelsmolecular pages 5-6). Furthermore, TRPM7 contributes to signaling pathways that control cytoskeletal dynamics, thereby affecting cell adhesion and migration, which are key processes in both normal cellular turnover and in pathological conditions such as cancer.\n\n8. Other Comments  \nKnown inhibitors and pharmacological modulators of TRPM7 have been explored in studies because inhibition of TRPM7 has been associated with alterations in cellular Mg²⁺ and Ca²⁺ homeostasis that can affect cell proliferation and survival. Although specific small-molecule inhibitors are not as well characterized as for other kinases, modulation of TRPM7 activity is of interest in therapeutic contexts such as in cancer and cardiovascular diseases, where dysregulation of magnesium transport and kinase signaling can contribute to disease pathogenesis. Disease associations have been reported in the context of disrupted magnesium homeostasis, embryonic lethality, and altered immune responses. Mutations in TRPM7, or its dysregulation, are being investigated for their potential roles in neurodegenerative disorders and conditions linked to defective cellular ion balance (clapham2001thetrpion pages 7-8, nishida2006trpchannelsmolecular pages 14-15).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nSerine/threonine‐protein kinase tousled‐like 1 (TLK1), also known as PKU‐beta or KIAA0137, is a member of the conserved Tousled‐like kinase family found in plants and metazoans. TLK1 orthologs are present from Arabidopsis thaliana to Caenorhabditis elegans and mammals, indicating an evolutionarily ancient function in DNA replication and chromatin assembly (benedetti2012thetousledlikekinases pages 2-3, segurabayona2019thetousledlikekinases pages 1-3). Within the human kinome, TLK1 belongs to a group of cell cycle–regulated serine/threonine kinases that share sequence similarity within their catalytic domains. It is closely related to TLK2, with which it shares high amino acid identity—particularly over the kinase domain—and the two enzymes often have overlapping functions. The evolutionary relationship of TLK1 and TLK2 reflects a gene duplication event in higher eukaryotes, and both enzymes are considered part of an essential core set of kinases that contribute to genome integrity in multicellular organisms (sillje1999mammalianhomologuesof pages 1-2, benedetti2012thetousledlikekinases pages 2-3).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nTLK1 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to target serine/threonine residues on substrate proteins. In biochemical terms the reaction can be summarized as: ATP + [protein]‐(L‐serine/threonine) → ADP + [protein]‐(phospho-L‐serine/threonine) + H⁺. This phosphorylation reaction is fundamental for regulating the function of its substrate proteins that include histone H3, components of the DNA damage response, and other chromatin‐associated factors (benedetti2012thetousledlikekinases pages 1-2, riefler2008tousledmediatedactivationof pages 1-1).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of TLK1 requires divalent metal ions as cofactors, with Mg²⁺ being essential for facilitating ATP binding and phosphate transfer to the substrate. In standard kinase assays, the presence of Mg²⁺ is critical to support its enzymatic function during phosphorylation reactions (bhoir2018highyieldbacterial pages 6-8).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nTLK1 phosphorylates serine and threonine residues in proteins that are directly involved in chromatin assembly and the DNA damage response. One well‐characterized substrate is histone H3, phosphorylated at serine 10—a modification that is linked to chromosome condensation and proper progression through mitosis (benedetti2012thetousledlikekinases pages 2-3). In addition, TLK1 phosphorylates ASF1 (anti‐silencing function 1), a histone chaperone whose phosphorylation is critical for ensuring efficient nucleosome assembly during DNA replication and repair (segurabayona2019thetousledlikekinases pages 4-5). Importantly, an isoform of TLK1 (isoform 3) phosphorylates and enhances the stability of the t‐SNARE protein SNAP23, thereby augmenting its assembly with syntaxin and contributing to cellular resistance to ionizing radiation by facilitating double‐strand break repair (bhoir2023targetingprostatecancer pages 19-20). Although a definitive consensus substrate motif for TLK1 has not been completely delineated in the available literature, its substrate specificity is dictated by the structural context provided by its catalytic domain and additional regulatory regions, ensuring that substrates connected with chromatin remodeling and DNA repair are preferentially phosphorylated (ghosh2023untouslingtherole pages 7-8).\n\n5. Structure  \nTLK1 displays a domain architecture typical of many serine/threonine kinases. It comprises a central catalytic kinase domain that is responsible for ATP binding and the transfer of the phosphate group. Flanking this catalytic domain are regulatory regions, including an N-terminal segment that contains nuclear localization signals (NLS) and predicted coiled-coil (CC) motifs. These coiled-coil domains are thought to mediate homo- or heterodimerization with TLK2, a structural arrangement that facilitates autophosphorylation and full enzyme activation (segurabayona2019thetousledlikekinases pages 5-7, mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 1-2). The activation loop within the kinase domain is subject to conformational changes upon autophosphorylation, which is common among serine/threonine kinases and necessary for catalytic competence. Structural features observed in crystallographic or homology models reveal a typical bilobal fold with a smaller N-terminal lobe predominantly made of β-sheets and a larger C-terminal lobe that is mainly helical. The catalytic cleft located between these lobes accommodates ATP and the protein substrate, and conserved motifs such as the DFG motif and the catalytic loop contribute to coordinating the metal ion cofactor and catalytic water molecules (mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 11-13, segurabayona2019thetousledlikekinases pages 4-5).\n\n6. Regulation  \nTLK1 activity is tightly controlled by cell cycle cues and DNA damage signals. Under normal S-phase conditions, TLK1 is active, promoting chromatin assembly by phosphorylating histone chaperones and other substrates. However, upon induction of DNA double-strand breaks, TLK1 is rapidly and transiently inhibited through phosphorylation. This DNA damage–induced inhibition is mediated via checkpoint signaling pathways, in particular through ATM-dependent activation of Chk1, which phosphorylates TLK1 at specific residues—such as serine 695—leading to a reduction of its kinase activity (benedetti2012thetousledlikekinases pages 6-7, sunavala‐dossabhoy2018preservingsalivarygland pages 12-16). In addition to DNA damage–dependent modulation, translational regulation via upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the 5′-UTR of TLK1B, an important splice variant, also influences TLK1 protein levels. Post-translational modifications, including autophosphorylation events, are essential for maintaining proper activity and regulating protein–protein interactions with substrates such as ASF1 and Rad9 (ghosh2023untouslingtherole pages 2-4, benedetti2012thetousledlikekinases pages 6-7).\n\n7. Function  \nTLK1 plays an important role in maintaining genome integrity through its involvement in chromatin assembly and the DNA damage response. In proliferating cells during S-phase, TLK1 phosphorylates histone H3 at serine 10, a modification associated with chromatin condensation and necessary for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis (riefler2008tousledmediatedactivationof pages 1-1). It also phosphorylates ASF1, a histone chaperone that facilitates the deposition of histones onto newly synthesized DNA, thereby ensuring efficient nucleosome formation and chromatin remodeling essential for both DNA replication and repair (segurabayona2019thetousledlikekinases pages 4-5). Moreover, TLK1 phosphorylates Rad9, a member of the 9-1-1 checkpoint clamp, to promote the timely deactivation of DNA damage checkpoints once repair processes are complete. Notably, the isoform 3 of TLK1 enhances the stability and assembly of the t-SNARE SNAP23, which supports the repair of DNA double-stranded breaks and provides protection from ionizing radiation (bhoir2023targetingprostatecancer pages 19-20). These functions situate TLK1 at a central node in signaling pathways that couple the DNA damage response to cell cycle progression and chromatin dynamics (benedetti2012thetousledlikekinases pages 2-3, ghosh2023untouslingtherole pages 5-7). TLK1 is expressed in a wide range of tissues, consistent with its indispensable role in genomic stability, and its activity is critical during periods of high DNA replication where chromatin assembly must be meticulously coordinated with replication fork progression.\n\n8. Other Comments  \nExperimental inhibitors of TLK1 have been investigated with phenothiazine derivatives such as thioridazine showing the ability to inhibit TLK1 autophosphorylation at low micromolar concentrations, though their binding modes require further clarification (hashimoto2008pkuβtlk1regulatesmyosin pages 3-5). Furthermore, TLK1 overexpression has been associated with increased resistance to DNA damaging agents, a feature with potential implications in cancer therapy. The functional profile of TLK1 also extends to roles in regulating cytoskeletal components, as indicated by studies demonstrating that TLK1-mediated phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chains is essential for accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis (hashimoto2008pkuβtlk1regulatesmyosin pages 3-5). To date, mutations specifically altering TLK1 function have not been extensively detailed; however, its pivotal role in DNA repair and chromatin dynamics implicates TLK1 in tumor adaptation to genotoxic stress, making it a promising target for therapeutic intervention in radioresistant cancers (bhoir2023targetingprostatecancer pages 5-6). In addition, the differential regulation of TLK1 isoforms, particularly the translationally controlled TLK1B variant, opens additional avenues for exploring how alternative splicing affects cellular responses to replication stress and DNA damage (benedetti2012thetousledlikekinases pages 3-4).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTLK2 is an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine kinase that belongs to the Tousled-like kinase family, a group first identified in plants (the original Tousled [TSL] kinase) and subsequently found in higher eukaryotes, including mammals. Orthologs of TLK2 are present in diverse species ranging from plants to vertebrates, and in mammals TLK2 is highly homologous to its paralog TLK1, sharing more than 94% identity in their kinase domains (sillje1999mammalianhomologuesof pages 1-2). Within the human kinome, TLK2 is part of a distinct branch of nuclear serine/threonine kinases and is considered to be evolutionarily related to kinases that control chromatin dynamics, positioning it among regulatory enzymes that coordinate DNA replication and repair processes (mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 1-2, sillje1999mammalianhomologuesof pages 2-3).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nTLK2 catalyzes the phosphorylation reaction in which ATP and a protein substrate containing serine or threonine residues are converted into ADP and the phosphorylated protein, with the release of a proton. In biochemical terms, its catalytic activity can be summarized as:  \n  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 15-15, sillje1999mammalianhomologuesof pages 7-9).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of TLK2 is dependent on the presence of divalent cations, in particular Mg²⁺, which serve as essential cofactors by facilitating ATP binding and phosphoryl transfer reactions. Kinase assays routinely include MgCl₂ in reaction buffers to ensure proper enzyme function (bhoir2018highyieldbacterial pages 3-4, sillje1999mammalianhomologuesof pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nTLK2 exhibits substrate specificity for serine and threonine residues on proteins involved in chromatin regulation. A primary substrate of TLK2 is the histone chaperone ASF1; phosphorylation of ASF1A by TLK2 prevents its proteasome-mediated degradation and thereby enhances chromatin assembly (mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 15-16). Although a definitive consensus motif has not been fully delineated by high‐throughput studies, the preferential targeting of ASF1 isoforms and related chromatin assembly factors indicates that TLK2 targets serine/threonine sites critical for nucleosome deposition and genome stability (ghosh2023untouslingtherole pages 1-2).\n\n5. Structure  \nTLK2 is organized into a modular structure comprising an N-terminal regulatory region and a C-terminal kinase domain. The N-terminal portion contains predicted coiled-coil domains and a nuclear localization signal (NLS), which are involved in mediating protein–protein interactions and promoting oligomerization. These oligomerization domains are necessary for full kinase activation and substrate recognition (sillje1999mammalianhomologuesof pages 2-3). The C-terminal kinase domain displays a typical bi-lobal fold seen in many serine/threonine kinases, including an N-lobe responsible for ATP binding and a larger C-lobe that carries the activation loop, catalytic loop, and conserved DFG motif. Structural studies, including crystallization of the kinase domain in complex with a slowly hydrolysable ATP analog (ATPγS), have revealed key autophosphorylation sites (such as S617, S686, T695, and others) that contribute to conformational changes and stabilization of the active state (mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 9-10, pages 94-96). In addition, the presence of a non-canonical P-loop and distinctive phosphorylation patterns within both the catalytic and regulatory regions distinguish TLK2 from other kinases with similar catalytic activities (bhoir2018highyieldbacterial pages 6-8).\n\n6. Regulation  \nRegulation of TLK2 activity is complex and involves multiple mechanisms. Autophosphorylation is a major regulatory mechanism by which TLK2 modulates its own activity. This process can occur in both cis (within the same monomer) and trans (between monomers in a dimer) fashions, resulting in sequential phosphorylation events that stabilize the active conformation of the enzyme (mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 2-3, pages 3-4). Specifically, phosphorylation of residues within the kinase domain (e.g., S617, S686, and T695) is essential for achieving full catalytic activity, while additional phosphorylation events in the C-terminal tail can also influence oligomer assembly and provide feedback regulation (mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 9-10). Furthermore, TLK2 activity is modulated by the cellular state; for example, checkpoint kinase CHK1 phosphorylates related TLK1 in response to DNA damage, and similar regulatory mechanisms are posited for TLK2, linking its kinase activity with DNA replication and repair responses (sillje1999mammalianhomologuesof pages 11-12, bhoir2018highyieldbacterial pages 6-8).\n\n7. Function  \nTLK2 plays a central role in the maintenance of genome and epigenome stability by regulating key processes related to chromatin assembly, DNA replication, transcription, repair, and chromosome segregation. Its phosphorylation of the histone chaperones ASF1A and ASF1B ensures proper nucleosome assembly during DNA replication by preventing the degradation of ASF1A and facilitating the delivery of histone H3-H4 dimers to sites of nucleosome formation (mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 15-16, ghosh2023untouslingtherole pages 1-2). In addition, TLK2 is involved in stabilizing replication forks and preventing the accumulation of replication stress, which is critical for the survival of proliferative cells and has been observed in contexts such as embryonic development and tumor cell growth (ghosh2023untouslingtherole pages 1-2, bhoir2018highyieldbacterial pages 3-4). Although TLK2 and TLK1 exhibit overlapping functions in many adult tissues, TLK2 has been found to have a unique role in placental development where it supports trophoblast differentiation (mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 15-15, sillje1999mammalianhomologuesof pages 11-12). Furthermore, TLK2 acts as a negative regulator of amino acid starvation-induced autophagy, linking chromatin dynamics to cellular metabolic state (Information).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nEfforts to develop specific inhibitors targeting TLK2 have focused on its ATP-binding pocket, with experimental compounds such as staurosporine, nocardiopsis-derived inhibitors, and indirubin derivatives showing binding compatibility based on structural modeling of its kinase domain (mortuza2018molecularbasisof pages 92-94, bhoir2018highyieldbacterial pages 6-8). TLK2 is associated with human disease; mutations in the TLK2 gene have been linked to intellectual disability and neurodevelopmental disorders, and gene amplification of TLK2 is observed in certain cancers, including estrogen receptor–positive breast cancers, where high TLK2 expression correlates with aggressive tumor behavior (ghosh2023untouslingtherole pages 1-2, sillje1999mammalianhomologuesof pages 11-12). These observations have made TLK2 a promising target for therapeutic intervention in oncology and in disorders related to genome instability (bhoir2018highyieldbacterial pages 3-4).\n\n9.

Acts downstream of several Rho family GTPase signal transduction pathways (PubMed:10436159, PubMed:11832213, PubMed:12807904, PubMed:15660133, PubMed:16230460, PubMed:18028908, PubMed:22328514, PubMed:23633677). Activated by upstream kinases including ROCK1, PAK1 and PAK4, which phosphorylate LIMK1 on a threonine residue located in its activation loop (PubMed:10436159). LIMK1 subsequently phosphorylates and inactivates the actin binding/depolymerizing factors cofilin-1/CFL1, cofilin-2/CFL2 and destrin/DSTN, thereby preventing the cleavage of filamentous actin (F-actin), and stabilizing the actin cytoskeleton (PubMed:11832213, PubMed:15660133, PubMed:16230460, PubMed:23633677). In this way LIMK1 regulates several actin-dependent biological processes including cell motility, cell cycle progression, and differentiation (PubMed:11832213, PubMed:15660133, PubMed:16230460, PubMed:23633677). Phosphorylates TPPP on serine residues, thereby promoting microtubule disassembly (PubMed:18028908).

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nLIM domain kinase 1 (LIMK1) is a serine/threonine kinase that is evolutionarily conserved among vertebrates and has been identified in all mammalian species studied to date (krupa2002therepertoireof pages 1-2). It belongs to the specialized group of kinases that contain one or more LIM domains, a feature that distinguishes the LIM kinase family from more conventional kinases. Within this family, LIMK1 is most closely related to its paralog, LIMK2, with which it shares approximately 50% overall amino acid identity and considerable similarity in the catalytic domain (mittelstaedt2012structuralandfunctional pages 274-277). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the LIM kinases emerged early during vertebrate evolution, and the distinct domain architecture characterized by N-terminal LIM motifs and an internal PDZ domain suggests that the LIM kinase family may have originated from an ancestral kinase that acquired additional protein–protein interaction modules during evolution (krupa2002therepertoireof pages 1-2, mittelstaedt2012structuralandfunctional pages 38-46). LIMK1 orthologs have been documented in mouse, rat, and other mammalian species, consistent with the findings that its gene structure is highly conserved across these organisms. This conservation underscores the kinase’s essential role in actin cytoskeleton regulation as well as its integration within complex signaling networks downstream of Rho GTPases (mittelstaedt2012structuralandfunctional pages 274-277).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nLIMK1 catalyzes the phosphorylation reaction that transfers the γ-phosphate from ATP to target proteins containing serine or threonine residues. In its canonical reaction, LIMK1 mediates the conversion of ATP and the non-phosphorylated form of its substrate into ADP and the phosphorylated substrate, according to the reaction:  \n  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺  \nThis reaction is fundamental for the regulation of actin dynamics, as it directly inactivates key actin-depolymerizing factors by phosphorylating them (mittelstaedt2012structuralandfunctional pages 38-46).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic action of LIMK1, as with most protein kinases, requires the binding of ATP in a complex with divalent metal ions, particularly Mg²⁺, which serves as an essential cofactor facilitating the nucleophilic attack of the substrate’s hydroxyl group on the γ-phosphate of ATP. This requirement for Mg²⁺ is critical for the proper coordination of ATP within the active site and for subsequent phosphoryl transfer during catalysis (mittelstaedt2012structuralandfunctional pages 32-38).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nLIMK1 exhibits a high degree of substrate specificity by selectively phosphorylating actin regulatory proteins, thereby directly influencing actin filament dynamics. A well-documented substrate of LIMK1 is cofilin—specifically, cofilin-1 and cofilin-2—which are phosphorylated at serine-3. The phosphorylation of cofilin by LIMK1 leads to inhibition of its actin-depolymerizing activity, resulting in stabilization of filamentous actin and consequent alterations in cell morphology and motility (mittelstaedt2012structuralandfunctional pages 274-277, mittelstaedt2012structuralandfunctional pages 56-60). In addition to cofilin, LIMK1 phosphorylates destrin (DSTN), another actin-binding protein that regulates actin turnover, and it has also been shown to phosphorylate tubulin polymerization-promoting protein (TPPP) on serine residues, a modification that promotes microtubule disassembly (protein function information, mittelstaedt2012structuralandfunctional pages 56-60). Although large-scale kinase substrate specificity profiling studies such as those described by Johnson et al. (johnson2023anatlasof pages 1-2) do not provide an explicit consensus sequence for LIMK1, the available data underscore that LIMK1 preferentially targets substrates with a phosphorylation site located in a specific sequence context that promotes recognition and efficient catalytic turnover. Thus, the kinase displays a narrow substrate spectrum that is defined by the precise phosphorylation of serine-3 within cofilin and similar target sites on related actin-regulatory proteins.\n\n5. Structure  \nLIMK1 is characterized by a multidomain organization that includes several distinct functional modules. At its N-terminus, LIMK1 contains two LIM domains. These LIM domains are cysteine-rich zinc-binding motifs that are critical for mediating protein–protein interactions and are involved in subcellular localization as well as in the formation of multiprotein complexes (mittelstaedt2012structuralandfunctional pages 38-46). Following the LIM domains, LIMK1 features a central PDZ domain that further contributes to its scaffolding function by enabling interactions with diverse proteins that contain complementary PDZ-binding motifs. This configuration facilitates the integration of LIMK1 into broader signaling complexes that regulate cytoskeletal dynamics. The C-terminal portion of the protein contains the kinase domain, which is responsible for the enzymatic activity of LIMK1. Detailed structural studies, including limited proteolysis and crystallization experiments, have delineated the kinase domain to span roughly residues 330 to 647 (mittelstaedt2012structuralandfunctional pages 121-130).  \nWithin the kinase domain, structural analyses using inhibitor-bound complexes (for example, with staurosporine) have revealed that the domain adopts a bi-lobal structure typical of protein kinases; it consists of an N-terminal lobe rich in β-sheets and a predominantly α-helical C-terminal lobe (mittelstaedt2012structuralandfunctional pages 153-164). Key catalytic features include the formation of a salt bridge involving residues in the αC helix and essential lysine residues that coordinate ATP binding. One unique aspect of LIMK1’s structure is an additional loop insertion that functionally replaces the conventional αG helix found in many kinases, a feature thought to influence substrate specificity, particularly towards cofilin (mittelstaedt2012structuralandfunctional pages 153-164). Another distinct structural element is a C-terminal helix, sometimes referred to as the αJ helix, which is absent in related kinases such as TES kinases. Furthermore, the activation loop in LIMK1, which contains the phosphorylatable threonine residue (T508), is critical for conformational activation; although a portion of this activation loop remains unresolved in crystal structures, its flexibility is believed to be linked to phosphorylation status and regulatory control of catalytic activity (mittelstaedt2012structuralandfunctional pages 164-171). Overall, the arrangement of the LIM, PDZ, and kinase domains enables LIMK1 to function as both a signaling scaffold and an active kinase, integrating multiple regulatory inputs via its multidomain architecture (mittelstaedt2012structuralandfunctional pages 38-46).\n\n6. Regulation  \nRegulation of LIMK1 occurs through several mechanisms that ensure its activity is finely tuned according to cellular demands. A primary regulatory mechanism involves phosphorylation of the kinase domain’s activation loop, specifically at threonine-508. This phosphorylation is carried out by upstream kinases such as Rho-associated kinase (ROCK1) and p21-activated kinases (PAK1 and PAK4), which themselves are activated downstream of Rho family GTPases. The phosphorylation at threonine-508 is essential for the full activation of LIMK1, as it induces conformational changes that align critical catalytic residues and facilitate substrate binding (mittelstaedt2012structuralandfunctional pages 53-56).  \nIn addition to phosphorylation-mediated activation, LIMK1 activity is modulated by its interactions with various regulatory proteins. For example, the chaperone protein Hsp90 has been shown to promote homodimerization of LIMK1, a process that not only stabilizes the active conformation of the kinase but also increases its half-life in the cell, extending from approximately 4 to 20 hours (mittelstaedt2012structuralandfunctional pages 53-56). Conversely, the phosphatase slingshot (SSH) serves as a negative regulator by dephosphorylating both LIMK1 and its substrate cofilin. This dephosphorylation reaction reverses the inhibition of cofilin, thereby restoring its actin-depolymerizing activity and contributing to the dynamic regulation of actin filament turnover (mittelstaedt2012structuralandfunctional pages 53-56).  \nAn additional layer of regulation is provided through alternative splicing of the LIMK1 transcript, which generates isoforms with distinct functional properties. One such isoform, known as LIMK1-short, lacks a portion of the kinase domain necessary for catalytic activity and functions in a dominant-negative manner, thereby modulating overall LIMK1 activity within the cell (mittelstaedt2012structuralandfunctional pages 38-46). This isoform diversity contributes to the precise spatial and temporal regulation of actin dynamics, ensuring that LIMK1 activity can be tailored to specific cellular contexts such as neuronal development or cell migration.\n\n7. Function  \nLIMK1 plays a central role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton through its kinase activity. By phosphorylating the actin-depolymerizing factors cofilin-1, cofilin-2, and destrin at serine-3, LIMK1 prevents these proteins from severing filamentous actin (F-actin), thereby stabilizing actin filaments (mittelstaedt2012structuralandfunctional pages 274-277, mittelstaedt2012structuralandfunctional pages 56-60). This modification is pivotal for maintaining cell shape, facilitating cell motility, and enabling processes such as cell cycle progression and differentiation. In the context of cancer biology, aberrant activation of LIMK1 leads to enhanced cell invasion and metastasis, highlighting its role in cytoskeletal reorganization during tumor progression (mittelstaedt2012structuralandfunctional pages 56-60, fulcher2020functionsandregulation pages 11-13).  \nBeyond its role in actin dynamics, LIMK1 also contributes to neuronal development by stimulating axonal outgrowth and by participating in brain development processes. Phosphorylation of substrates such as TPPP, which results in microtubule disassembly, indicates that LIMK1 is involved in the regulation of the microtubule network as well—a function that may be critical during neuronal morphogenesis (protein function information, mittelstaedt2012structuralandfunctional pages 56-60). Additionally, LIMK1 is implicated in signal transduction pathways downstream of Rho GTPases. These upstream regulators transmit extracellular signals to LIMK1, thereby integrating environmental cues into cytoskeletal rearrangements; such signaling is essential for cell migration, adhesion, and morphological changes (mittelstaedt2012structuralandfunctional pages 274-277). The tissue distribution of LIMK1 is broad, with notable expression in brain, kidney, lung, and testes, which underscores its versatile role in different cellular contexts and developmental processes (protein function information, mittelstaedt2012structuralandfunctional pages 38-46).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral aspects of LIMK1 have captured interest for therapeutic intervention. Inhibitors that target LIMK1—particularly ATP-competitive compounds—are being developed with the aim of modulating actin cytoskeletal dynamics in disease states such as cancer metastasis and glaucoma. For instance, thiazole derivatives have been reported as potential LIMK inhibitors with the capacity to promote actin depolymerization by dampening LIMK1 activity (leoni2014novelthiazolederivatives pages 9-10). Genetic studies and data aggregated in resources like the Open Targets Platform further imply that LIMK1 is associated with neurodevelopmental abnormalities as well as certain cancer-related phenotypes (OpenTargets Search: -LIMK1, fulcher2020functionsandregulation pages 11-13). Inhibitor development is a focus of current research, with efforts aimed at achieving high specificity given that LIMK1 participates in complex regulatory networks; thus, selective targeting of LIMK1 is crucial to mitigate potential off-target effects. The existence of dominant-negative isoforms such as LIMK1-short also adds a layer of regulatory complexity that may influence inhibitor efficacy. As advances in structural biology continue—for example, crystallographic studies of LIMK1 kinase domain complexes with inhibitors—structure-based drug design may yield more potent and selective therapeutic compounds in the future (mittelstaedt2012structuralandfunctional pages 153-164).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nLIM domain kinase 2 (LIMK2) is a member of the LIM kinase family that is evolutionarily conserved across vertebrates, including mammals (human, mouse, rat), amphibians (e.g., Xenopus laevis), birds, and even certain invertebrates such as Drosophila species and Anopheles, although its distribution is largely confined to organisms requiring sophisticated cytoskeletal regulation. LIMK2 shares approximately 50% overall sequence identity with its paralog LIMK1 and is most closely related to TESK kinases, which also regulate cofilin activity (goyal2005dualfunctionof pages 24-28, scott2010limkinaseregulationa pages 16-20). Phylogenetic analyses indicate that LIMK2 emerged through gene duplication events early in vertebrate evolution and forms part of the kinome “core” set of regulatory enzymes that have been maintained to control actin dynamics (ribba2022theroleof pages 1-2, scott2010limkinaseregulation pages 11-16).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nLIMK2 catalyzes the transfer of the γ-phosphate group from ATP to specific serine and, in some contexts, tyrosine residues in its substrates. The canonical reaction can be written as:  \nATP + protein-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + protein-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺.  \nA primary physiological target of LIMK2 is the actin depolymerizing factor cofilin, which is phosphorylated at serine 3; this modification inactivates cofilin’s actin-severing activity, resulting in stabilization of actin filaments (brion2021limkinasesin pages 2-4).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of LIMK2 is dependent on ATP as the phosphate donor and requires divalent metal ions—most commonly Mg²⁺—to facilitate nucleotide binding and proper orientation of the ATP for phosphotransfer reactions. These cofactor requirements are typical of serine/threonine kinases and support LIMK2’s function in phosphorylating substrates such as cofilin (brion2021limkinasesin pages 2-4, goyal2005dualfunctionof pages 24-28).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nLIMK2 exhibits a pronounced substrate specificity for members of the ADF/cofilin family, phosphorylating them on a specific serine residue (serine 3). This phosphorylation event blocks the actin filament–severing activity of cofilin, thereby controlling actin filament turnover and stabilization. Although detailed consensus motifs are not as comprehensively defined as for some other kinases, LIMK2 displays a marked preference for sequences that present the cofilin N-terminus in a conformation amenable to phosphorylation (chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 10-11, ribba2022theroleof pages 13-15).\n\n5. Structure  \nLIMK2 contains a modular domain organization that is essential for its function and regulation. The protein architecture comprises two N-terminal LIM domains—each containing double zinc finger motifs that mediate protein–protein interactions and provide structural stabilization—followed by a central PDZ domain that contributes to subcellular localization and further protein binding. Adjacent to the PDZ domain is a serine/proline-rich (S/P) region that may serve as a flexible linker and regulatory module, leading into the C-terminal kinase domain responsible for catalytic activity (goyal2005dualfunctionof pages 24-28, villalonga2023limkinaseslimk1 pages 1-2).  \nStructural studies and homology modelling indicate that the kinase domain adopts the characteristic bilobal architecture seen in protein kinases, with a smaller N-terminal lobe featuring a glycine-rich P loop, a larger C-terminal lobe, and an activation loop that undergoes phosphorylation-dependent transitions between inactive (DFG-out) and active (DFG-in) conformations (chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 8-10, mittelstaedt2012structuralandfunctional pages 38-46). A unique feature of LIMK2 is the presence of a distinctive catalytic loop motif (DLNSHN) in subdomain VIB, which is rarely encountered among typical serine/threonine kinases and may contribute to its substrate specificity and regulation (manetti2012limkinasesare pages 3-6, sooreshjani2021identifyingtheversatile pages 23-28). Additionally, LIMK2 has been reported to form homodimers through interactions involving its LIM domains, a process that facilitates autophosphorylation and stabilization of the active kinase conformation (chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 11-12, goyal2005dualfunctionofa pages 24-28).\n\n6. Regulation  \nLIMK2 activity is tightly regulated by multiple mechanisms that ensure spatial and temporal control of actin cytoskeleton remodeling. One critical mechanism is phosphorylation of the activation loop; most notably, phosphorylation at threonine 505 by upstream kinases such as ROCK (Rho-associated protein kinase), p21-activated kinases (PAKs), and MRCKα serves to enhance LIMK2 kinase activity (brion2021limkinasesin pages 2-4, chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 11-12). In addition, Aurora-A kinase has been identified as an activator of LIMK2, capable of phosphorylating multiple serine and threonine residues, which further modulate its activity (rak2014novellimk2inhibitor pages 1-2).  \nAutoinhibitory interactions also play a role in regulating kinase activity; the N-terminal LIM domains and the adjacent PDZ domain form intramolecular contacts that can restrain kinase activity until appropriate upstream signals trigger a conformational change (goyal2005dualfunctionof pages 24-28, ribba2022theroleof pages 12-13). Furthermore, stabilization and proper dimerization—a process promoted by interaction with molecular chaperones such as Hsp90—are essential for full kinase activation; inhibition of Hsp90 leads to decreased LIMK2 levels and consequent reduction in cofilin phosphorylation (chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 1-3, manetti2012limkinasesare pages 3-6). Additional layers of regulation are provided by phosphatases, including PP1 and PP2A, which can dephosphorylate both LIMK2 and its substrates to restore basal actin dynamics (brion2021limkinasesin pages 2-4).\n\n7. Function  \nLIMK2 plays an essential role in regulating actin filament dynamics through its ability to phosphorylate and inactivate cofilin, thereby modulating the balance between actin polymerization and depolymerization. The phosphorylation of cofilin stabilizes filamentous actin, contributing to proper cell morphology, migration, and adhesion (brion2021limkinasesin pages 2-4, chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 10-11). Beyond its canonical role in actin dynamics, LIMK2 has been implicated in the regulation of microtubule dynamics; for instance, its phosphorylation of TPPP affects tubulin polymerization and is involved in the orientation of the mitotic spindle during early mitosis, thereby influencing cell division and cytokinesis (brion2021limkinasesin pages 2-4, podkowa2010characterizationofbmp pages 65-70).  \nLIMK2 is also involved in processes beyond direct cytoskeletal remodeling. It functions downstream of Rho family GTPases, thus integrating extracellular signals that govern cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation. Its activity has been linked to oncogenic signaling pathways in various cancers, where dysregulated actin remodeling can promote tumor invasion and metastasis (rak2014novellimk2inhibitor pages 1-2, ribba2022theroleof pages 13-15). In addition, LIMK2 has a role in suppressing ciliogenesis by phosphorylating CFL1, by controlling the directional trafficking of ciliary vesicles, and by promoting the nuclear localization of YAP1, where it functions as a transcriptional corepressor for genes such as AURKA and PLK1 (Protein Information section). Expression of LIMK2 is ubiquitous, with a broader tissue distribution compared to LIMK1, which is more restricted; this suggests that LIMK2 may have functions in multiple cell types ranging from neuronal to muscle and epithelial cells (villalonga2023limkinaseslimk1 pages 1-2, shah2023limk2amultifaceted pages 1-3).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral small-molecule inhibitors targeting LIMK2 have been developed in preclinical models, with compounds such as T56-LIMKi demonstrating selective inhibition of LIMK2 activity without impairing LIMK1 function (rak2014novellimk2inhibitor pages 1-2). These inhibitors have been used to reduce phosphorylated cofilin levels and consequently affect tumor cell migration and proliferation, highlighting LIMK2 as a promising target in cancer therapy. Disease associations for LIMK2 include its implication in various cancers, where its dysregulated activity contributes to tumor growth, metastasis, and chemoresistance. Furthermore, LIMK2 is involved in cell cycle regulation during mitosis through its roles in astral microtubule organization and spindle orientation; defects in these processes may be associated with developmental abnormalities and proliferative disorders (brion2021limkinasesin pages 2-4, shah2023limk2amultifaceted pages 13-16). Beyond cancer, LIMK2’s suppression of ciliogenesis via multiple pathways also connects it to disorders of ciliopathy. No specific disease-causing mutations have been consistently reported in the literature for LIMK2; however, alterations in its regulation or expression levels have been linked to pathological conditions (chatterjee2022structuralaspectsof pages 11-12, ribba2022theroleof pages 13-15).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase Etk, whose gene is annotated as yccC, belongs to the family of bacterial tyrosine kinases (BY‐kinases) that are widely distributed among proteobacteria. Within this group, Etk is phylogenetically related to other BY‐kinases such as Wzc and SopA, which share conserved catalytic and structural motifs including Walker A, Walker A′, and Walker B motifs that define ATPase activity in this enzyme class (hansen2013theescherichiacoli pages 1-2). Comparative genomic analyses demonstrate that BY‐kinases represent an evolutionarily distinct “kinome” in prokaryotes, and Etk clusters with the proteobacterial single‐polypeptide chain versions that combine transmembrane sensory modules with an intracellular catalytic domain. The evolutionary conservation of these kinases, in contrast with eukaryotic tyrosine kinases that typically possess Hanks‐type catalytic domains, underscores their independent evolutionary origin and functional specialization in regulating processes such as extracellular polysaccharide biosynthesis and virulence (hansen2013theescherichiacoli pages 2-3, engin2021bacterialproteinkinases pages 329-331).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nEtk catalyzes the transfer of the γ‐phosphate group from ATP to specific tyrosine residues on target substrate proteins. The chemical reaction can be summarized as: ATP + [protein]–(L‐tyrosine) → ADP + [protein]–(L‐tyrosine‐phosphate) + H⁺. This reaction, characteristic of protein tyrosine kinases, involves the nucleophilic attack by the phenolic hydroxyl group of tyrosine on the γ‐phosphate of ATP (template; hansen2013theescherichiacoli pages 2-3).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of Etk is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ion cofactors, most notably Mg²⁺. The Mg²⁺ ion coordinates with the phosphates of ATP within the active site, which is critical for the stabilization of the transition state during the phosphoryl transfer reaction (template; engin2021bacterialproteinkinases pages 329-331).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nEtk exhibits substrate specificity primarily for tyrosine residues, and its kinase domain is optimized to accommodate side chains characteristic of tyrosine rather than serine or threonine. Mass spectrometry‐based phosphoproteomic analysis in Escherichia coli has identified over 500 unique phosphotyrosine sites across hundreds of proteins, many of which are believed to be direct or indirect substrates of BY‐kinases including Etk (hansen2013theescherichiacoli pages 3-4). The substrate peptides often contain a distinct set of features; for instance, enrichment of positively charged amino acids such as lysine at positions +3 to +5 relative to the phosphorylated tyrosine, along with a recurrent glycine at the −1 position and aspartate at the +1 position, has been observed (hansen2013theescherichiacoli pages 3-4, hansen2013theescherichiacoli pages 5-8). Although a canonical linear consensus has not been strictly defined, these identified motifs suggest that Etk preferentially acts on tyrosine residues that are embedded within accessible, flexible regions of its substrate proteins. This substrate recognition is crucial not only for the regulation of metabolic enzymes but also for virulence‐associated proteins such as those involved in the type III secretion system in pathogenic strains (hansen2013theescherichiacoli pages 8-9).\n\n5. Structure  \nEtk comprises a single polypeptide that typically includes an N‐terminal region with transmembrane segments and a C‐terminal intracellular kinase domain. The catalytic domain displays a three‐dimensional structure characterized by an eight‐stranded parallel β‐sheet flanked by α‐helices, reminiscent of ATPase folds found in proteins such as MinD (lee2008structureofescherichia pages 1-2). Critical to its function are the conserved Walker A, Walker A′, and Walker B motifs that form the nucleotide-binding pocket. Structural studies have revealed that a unique tyrosine residue, Y574, located at the beginning of an α‐helix near the active site, functions as a molecular switch; in its dephosphorylated state, Y574 sterically obstructs substrate access, while phosphorylation of Y574 prompts a conformational rearrangement that alleviates this block by enabling interaction with a conserved arginine residue (R614) (lee2008structureofescherichia pages 6-7, lee2008structuralandfunctional pages 94-100). In addition, Etk contains a C‐terminal tyrosine‐rich cluster that becomes autophosphorylated and plays a key role in modulating its oligomerization state and functional interactions with downstream partners. A positively charged region—often referred to as an RK‐cluster—located proximal to the C‐terminal segment further contributes to the regulation of oligomerization by electrostatically interacting with the phosphorylated tyrosine cluster, thereby influencing the activity of the polysaccharide export machinery (lee2008structuralandfunctional pages 156-162, lee2008structureofescherichia pages 5-6).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of Etk activity is attained through reversible phosphorylation events that serve as molecular switches for activation and inactivation. Autophosphorylation on its C‐terminal tyrosine cluster is required for full kinase activity, and this modification modulates the assembly state of Etk, with fully phosphorylated forms favoring a monomeric or lower‐order oligomeric state conducive to catalytic function. Specifically, phosphorylation of the regulatory Y574 relieves autoinhibition by promoting a conformational rearrangement that permits substrate access to the active site (lee2008structureofescherichia pages 6-7, hansen2013theescherichiacoli pages 10-11). The kinase is also subject to dephosphorylation by a dedicated phosphotyrosine phosphatase, which resets its phosphorylation state and modulates its enzymatic output. These post‐translational modifications ensure that Etk activity is tightly controlled in response to intracellular signals, thereby regulating downstream processes including capsule formation and virulence factor production (hansen2013theescherichiacoli pages 12-13, hansen2013theescherichiacoli pages 9-10).\n\n7. Function  \nEtk plays a central role in the regulation of several critical cellular processes in Escherichia coli. Functionally, Etk is implicated in the control of extracellular polysaccharide biosynthesis, particularly in the export of capsular polysaccharides which are essential for biofilm formation and protection against host immune responses. Phosphorylation of Etk substrates extends to virulence‐associated proteins involved in the type III secretion system (T3SS), which facilitate the interaction with host cells during infection (hansen2013theescherichiacoli pages 5-8). In addition to these roles in virulence, Etk phosphorylates enzymes that participate in key metabolic pathways, thereby integrating signal transduction with central cellular metabolism (hansen2013theescherichiacoli pages 2-3). The interplay between Etk-mediated phosphorylation events and other cellular regulatory mechanisms contributes to bacterial adaptation under various stress conditions, influences antibiotic resistance, and modulates overall pathogenic potential (hansen2013theescherichiacoli pages 9-10, engin2021bacterialproteinkinases pages 331-335).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral inhibitors targeting BY‐kinases are under investigation as potential therapeutic agents aimed at reducing virulence or interfering with extracellular polysaccharide assembly in pathogenic bacteria. Among these, ATP‐competitive compounds and specific neutralizing antibodies have been developed to inhibit kinase activity, although inactivation of Etk and its orthologs often reveals functional redundancy among bacterial tyrosine kinases (hansen2013theescherichiacoli pages 13-14, engin2021bacterialproteinkinases pages 331-335). Notably, the modulation of Etk activity through its reversible phosphorylation cycle—coupled with the dynamic regulation of its oligomerization state—has been directly linked to shifts in virulence factor expression and biofilm formation, which are critical for bacterial survival under hostile environmental conditions (hansen2013theescherichiacoli pages 2-3, engin2021bacterialproteinkinases pages 331-335). These characteristics have made Etk a subject of interest both as a model for bacterial tyrosine kinase regulation and as a potential target for anti‐infective strategies. Inhibition of Etk activity may thus offer a means of attenuating pathogenicity in strains where capsular polysaccharide production is essential for immune evasion, although selectivity and efficacy issues remain active areas of research (engin2021bacterialproteinkinases pages 331-335).\n\n9.

Binding of antigen to the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) triggers signaling that ultimately leads to B-cell activation (PubMed:19290921). After BCR engagement and activation at the plasma membrane, phosphorylates PLCG2 at several sites, igniting the downstream signaling pathway through calcium mobilization, followed by activation of the protein kinase C (PKC) family members (PubMed:11606584). PLCG2 phosphorylation is performed in close cooperation with the adapter protein B-cell linker protein BLNK (PubMed:11606584). BTK acts as a platform to bring together a diverse array of signaling proteins and is implicated in cytokine receptor signaling pathways (PubMed:16517732, PubMed:17932028). Plays an important role in the function of immune cells of innate as well as adaptive immunity, as a component of the Toll-like receptors (TLR) pathway (PubMed:16517732). The TLR pathway acts as a primary surveillance system for the detection of pathogens and are crucial to the activation of host defense (PubMed:16517732). Especially, is a critical molecule in regulating TLR9 activation in splenic B-cells (PubMed:16517732, PubMed:17932028). Within the TLR pathway, induces tyrosine phosphorylation of TIRAP which leads to TIRAP degradation (PubMed:16415872). BTK also plays a critical role in transcription regulation (PubMed:19290921). Induces the activity of NF-kappa-B, which is involved in regulating the expression of hundreds of genes (PubMed:19290921). BTK is involved on the signaling pathway linking TLR8 and TLR9 to NF-kappa-B (PubMed:19290921). Acts as an activator of NLRP3 inflammasome assembly by mediating phosphorylation of NLRP3 (PubMed:34554188). Transiently phosphorylates transcription factor GTF2I on tyrosine residues in response to BCR (PubMed:9012831). GTF2I then translocates to the nucleus to bind regulatory enhancer elements to modulate gene expression (PubMed:9012831). ARID3A and NFAT are other transcriptional target of BTK (PubMed:16738337). BTK is required for the formation of functional ARID3A DNA-binding complexes (PubMed:16738337). There is however no evidence that BTK itself binds directly to DNA (PubMed:16738337). BTK has a dual role in the regulation of apoptosis (PubMed:9751072). Plays a role in STING1-mediated induction of type I interferon (IFN) response by phosphorylating DDX41 (PubMed:25704810)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nBruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a member of the Tec family of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases, a group that also includes inducible T cell kinase (ITK), bone marrow tyrosine kinase on chromosome X (BMX), TEC, and TXK, and it is evolutionarily conserved across vertebrate species, with orthologs identified in mammals, birds, and amphibians (singh2018roleofbruton’s pages 2-4). BTK shares a common ancestry with other kinases that emerged early in the evolution of eukaryotes, and its placement within the kinome was established by large-scale analyses that characterized the complement of human kinases (mcdonald2021theroleof pages 1-2). As part of the Tec family, BTK occupies a distinct phylogenetic niche relative to the large families such as the Src, AGC, and CMGC kinases, and its domain organization distinguishes it from receptor tyrosine kinases and other non‐receptor classes (hendriks2014targetingbrutonstyrosine pages 5-6).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nBTK catalyzes the transfer of the γ-phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to specific tyrosine residues on target proteins, a reaction critical for transducing signals in B-cell receptor (BCR) and other immunoreceptor pathways (buggy2012brutontyrosinekinase pages 1-3). The general reaction can be written as follows: ATP + [protein]-tyrosine → ADP + [protein]-phosphotyrosine + H⁺, reflecting its role as an ATP-dependent tyrosine kinase (wen2021inhibitorstargetingbruton’s pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of BTK is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions, with magnesium (Mg²⁺) serving as an essential cofactor that coordinates ATP binding and facilitates the phosphoryl transfer reaction (xing2014brutonstkinhibitors pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nBTK exhibits substrate specificity for proteins that contain target tyrosine residues within a context amenable to phosphorylation; a well‐characterized substrate in B-cell signaling is phospholipase C gamma 2 (PLCγ2), which is phosphorylated at multiple tyrosine sites following B-cell receptor engagement (buggy2012brutontyrosinekinase pages 3-4). Although consensus substrate motifs for many tyrosine kinases have been defined through systematic studies, BTK’s physiological substrates include adapter proteins such as BLNK and signaling regulators such as TIRAP, with recognition likely involving structural determinants in addition to local amino acid context (zain2021structurefunctionrelationshipsof pages 7-9). Its substrate specificity is further underscored by the ability of BTK to phosphorylate components in both the BCR and Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways, thus modulating downstream effectors such as NF-κB (singh2018roleofbruton’s pages 2-4).\n\n5. Structure  \nThe overall structure of BTK is characterized by a modular domain organization that includes an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a Tec homology (TH) domain that contains a zinc-binding motif, followed by Src homology (SH3 and SH2) domains, and a C-terminal kinase domain responsible for catalytic function (lou2012bruton’styrosinekinase pages 9-10, xing2014brutonstkinhibitors pages 2-3). The PH domain plays a critical role in targeting BTK to the plasma membrane by binding to phosphoinositides such as PIP₃, and this membrane localization is necessary for its activation by upstream kinases (buggy2012brutontyrosinekinase pages 1-3). Within the kinase domain, key structural features include the activation loop—which contains the tyrosine residue Y551, whose phosphorylation is essential for kinase activation—and an autophosphorylation site at Y223 located in the SH3 domain; the catalytic cleft also harbors a cysteine residue at position 481 that is a critical target for covalent inhibitors such as ibrutinib (xing2014brutonstkinhibitors pages 18-19, schnute2012brutonstyrosinekinase pages 3-6). The enzyme exhibits conformational flexibility with regions such as the αC-helix and the DFG motif adopting different orientations in the active versus inactive states, and crystal structures of the kinase domain have illustrated an “αC-helix-out” inactive conformation that is stabilized in part by disruptions of key salt bridges (xing2014brutonstkinhibitors pages 19-20).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe activity of BTK is tightly regulated by numerous mechanisms, predominantly through phosphorylation events and protein-protein interactions. Phosphorylation of Y551 in the kinase domain—catalyzed by upstream kinases such as SYK or members of the Src family (e.g., LYN)—induces a conformational change that markedly increases BTK’s catalytic activity (buggy2012brutontyrosinekinase pages 3-4). Following this event, BTK undergoes autophosphorylation at Y223 within its SH3 domain, which further stabilizes its active conformation and promotes propagation of downstream signaling via substrates like PLCγ2 (singh2018roleofbruton’s pages 2-4, wen2021inhibitorstargetingbruton’s pages 1-2). In addition to phosphorylation, BTK functions as a scaffold protein that nucleates various multiprotein complexes involved in B-cell and Toll-like receptor signaling; for instance, it induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the TIR domain-containing adaptor protein (TIRAP), thereby triggering its degradation and fine-tuning TLR9-mediated signaling (buggy2012brutontyrosinekinase pages 9-11). Moreover, BTK is implicated in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome through phosphorylation of NLRP3, a process that is central to the regulation of innate immune responses (mcdonald2021theroleof pages 22-25). Together, these regulatory events coordinate the spatiotemporal activity of BTK, ensuring that it is activated in response to appropriate antigen receptor engagement and modulated during stress and inflammatory conditions (crofford2016theroleof pages 9-10, hendriks2014targetingbrutonstyrosine pages 11-12).\n\n7. Function  \nBTK plays an indispensable role in both the adaptive and innate branches of the immune system. In B lymphocytes, BTK is essential for transmitting signals from the B-cell receptor (BCR) upon antigen engagement, thereby facilitating B-cell development, proliferation, differentiation, and survival (buggy2012brutontyrosinekinase pages 1-3, singh2018roleofbruton’s pages 1-2). Its activation leads to the phosphorylation of PLCγ2, which in turn catalyzes the production of second messengers that mobilize intracellular calcium and subsequently activate protein kinase C (PKC) family members; these events culminate in the activation of transcription factors such as NF-κB that regulate the expression of genes critical for B-cell function (buggy2012brutontyrosinekinase pages 3-4, wen2021inhibitorstargetingbruton’s pages 1-2). Beyond its role in BCR signaling, BTK is also a key component of signaling pathways initiated by Toll-like receptors (TLRs), where it influences the production of cytokines and type I interferons through its modulation of NF-κB and IRF-dependent gene transcription (mcdonald2021theroleof pages 2-5, weber2017bruton’styrosinekinase pages 1-2). Additionally, BTK is involved in the assembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby playing a role in the regulation of inflammatory responses and programmed cell death (zain2021structurefunctionrelationshipsof pages 9-9). In the context of transcription regulation, BTK contributes indirectly by transiently phosphorylating transcription factors such as GTF2I, which then translocates to the nucleus and modulates gene enhancer activity, and it is required for the formation of functional ARID3A DNA-binding complexes, further influencing the transcriptional landscape of immune cells (buggy2012brutontyrosinekinase pages 9-11). Expression of BTK is predominantly observed in hematopoietic cells, especially B cells, mast cells, monocytes, and macrophages, while its expression is negligible in T lymphocytes and terminally differentiated plasma cells; this restricted expression pattern underscores its specialized role in adaptive immunity and the fine regulation of innate immune responses (crofford2016theroleof pages 16-21, hendriks2014targetingbrutonstyrosine pages 1-2).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral potent inhibitors of BTK have been developed based on its structural and functional profiles, notably the irreversible covalent inhibitor ibrutinib, which binds to the cysteine residue at position 481 within the ATP-binding pocket, leading to sustained inhibition of BTK activity in B-cell malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) (xing2014brutonstkinhibitors pages 16-18, weber2017bruton’styrosinekinase pages 2-4). Second-generation inhibitors, including acalabrutinib and zanubrutinib, have been introduced with the aim of improving selectivity and reducing off-target effects while retaining clinical efficacy (wen2021inhibitorstargetingbruton’s pages 1-2, ringheim2021bruton’styrosinekinase pages 1-2). Mutations within BTK, such as those affecting its critical catalytic residues, are known to result in immunodeficiency disorders like X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), while dysregulation or overactivation of BTK contributes to the pathogenesis of a wide range of B-cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases (buggy2012brutontyrosinekinase pages 1-3, singh2018roleofbruton’s pages 17-17). In addition to its inhibitor-based therapeutic applications, BTK’s role in linking signals from both the BCR and TLR pathways as well as its involvement in the regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome highlight its potential as a broader target for modulating inflammatory responses in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus (mcdonald2021theroleof pages 22-25, schnute2012brutonstyrosinekinase pages 8-11). Ongoing research into the precise substrate specificities, allosteric regulatory mechanisms, and interaction networks of BTK continues to provide a deeper understanding of its multifaceted roles in immune cell signaling (zain2021structurefunctionrelationshipsof pages 1-2, rozkiewicz2023bruton’styrosinekinase pages 3-5).\n\n9.

Regulates the development, function and differentiation of conventional T-cells and nonconventional NKT-cells. When antigen presenting cells (APC) activate T-cell receptor (TCR), a series of phosphorylation lead to the recruitment of ITK to the cell membrane, in the vicinity of the stimulated TCR receptor, where it is phosphorylated by LCK. Phosphorylation leads to ITK autophosphorylation and full activation. Once activated, phosphorylates PLCG1, leading to the activation of this lipase and subsequent cleavage of its substrates. In turn, the endoplasmic reticulum releases calcium in the cytoplasm and the nuclear activator of activated T-cells (NFAT) translocates into the nucleus to perform its transcriptional duty. Phosphorylates 2 essential adapter proteins: the linker for activation of T-cells/LAT protein and LCP2. Then, a large number of signaling molecules such as VAV1 are recruited and ultimately lead to lymphokine production, T-cell proliferation and differentiation (PubMed:12186560, PubMed:12682224, PubMed:21725281). Required for TCR-mediated calcium response in gamma-delta T-cells, may also be involved in the modulation of the transcriptomic signature in the Vgamma2-positive subset of immature gamma-delta T-cells (By similarity). Phosphorylates TBX21 at 'Tyr-530' and mediates its interaction with GATA3 (By similarity)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‑protein kinase ITK (also known as Interleukin‑2‑inducible T‑cell kinase, Kinase EMT, T‑cell‑specific kinase, and Tyrosine‑protein kinase Lyk; gene: ITK) is classified as a member of the Tec family of non‑receptor tyrosine kinases. This family, which includes related kinases such as Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK), TEC, BMX, and RLK/Txk, is characterized by a conserved modular structure that is distinct from the Src family. ITK orthologs have been reported across a wide range of mammalian species as well as in earlier vertebrate lineages, indicating that the catalytic core and regulatory architecture of ITK are evolutionarily conserved and have been maintained through vertebrate evolution due to their essential role in regulating lymphocyte development and function (zhong2014targetinginterleukin2inducibletcell pages 11-13, devkota2017anautoinhibitoryrole pages 1-3). Comprehensive kinome analyses have established that the Tec family emerged early in vertebrate evolution, forming an independent branch within the human kinome dedicated largely to the regulation of adaptive immune responses.\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nITK functions as a tyrosine kinase by catalyzing a phosphorylation reaction in which the γ‑phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is transferred to a specific tyrosine residue on a protein substrate. The general catalytic reaction can be represented as:  \n  ATP + protein-(L-tyrosine) = ADP + protein-(L-tyrosine-phosphate) + H⁺.  \nThis ATP-dependent phosphoryl transfer is critical for initiating and propagating the intracellular signaling cascades that follow T‑cell receptor (TCR) engagement (zhong2014targetinginterleukin2inducibletcell pages 11-13).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of ITK, like that of all ATP-dependent kinases, is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ion cofactors. Specifically, magnesium ions (Mg²⁺) are required to coordinate the negatively charged phosphate groups of ATP and facilitate the positioning of ATP for the phosphoryl transfer reaction. The presence of Mg²⁺ stabilizes the ATP binding within the active site of ITK, thus ensuring optimal catalytic performance during the phosphorylation process (zhong2014targetinginterleukin2inducibletcell pages 11-13, howe2019magnesiumrestoresactivity pages 7-8).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nITK exhibits substrate specificity that is finely tuned to its central role within T‑cell receptor signaling. It preferentially phosphorylates tyrosine residues on proteins that function in the propagation of signals downstream of T‑cell activation. Key substrates of ITK include phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLCG1), which requires phosphorylation for activation; once phosphorylated, PLCG1 catalyzes the hydrolysis of its lipid substrate to generate inositol trisphosphate (IP₃) and diacylglycerol (DAG), thereby mobilizing intracellular calcium. In addition, ITK phosphorylates the adaptor protein LAT (linker for activation of T cells), which serves as a scaffold for the assembly of multiprotein complexes, as well as LCP2 (also known as SLP‑76), which further propagates downstream signaling events. ITK is also reported to phosphorylate the transcription factor TBX21 (T‑bet) at Tyr‑530, thereby regulating its interaction with the transcriptional partner GATA3. Although no single consensus sequence has been firmly delineated, the overall substrate preference reflects a tendency to target tyrosine residues that reside within motifs present in proteins that are central to the T‑cell activation process (basu2023gapjunctionalintercellular pages 163-165, kannan2015requirementforitk pages 8-9).\n\n5. Structure  \nThe three‑dimensional structure of ITK is defined by a modular organization of evolutionarily conserved domains that determine both its catalytic function and regulatory dynamics. The N‑terminal region is composed of a Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domain, which binds phosphoinositide lipids such as phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5‑trisphosphate (PIP₃) generated by PI3 kinase. This interaction is essential for the translocation of ITK to the plasma membrane during T‑cell activation (zhong2014targetinginterleukin2inducibletcell pages 11-13, huang2014functionofil2inducible pages 11-15). Adjacent to the PH domain is the Tec Homology (TH) domain, which includes a zinc‑binding Btk Homology (BH) motif along with multiple proline‑rich regions. The TH domain contributes to the structural stability of ITK and may facilitate oligomerization while also participating in intramolecular interactions that maintain ITK in an autoinhibited state under resting conditions (devkota2017anautoinhibitoryrole pages 1-3, huang2014functionofil2inducibleb pages 11-15).  \nFollowing the TH domain, ITK contains an Src Homology 3 (SH3) domain that binds proline‑rich sequences within both its own structure and in interacting proteins, and an Src Homology 2 (SH2) domain, which mediates interactions with phosphotyrosine motifs on partner proteins. The C‑terminal region is occupied by the kinase domain (also referred to as the SH1 domain), which houses the active site responsible for catalysis. Within the kinase domain, structural motifs such as the activation loop — featuring a critical tyrosine residue at position 511 — the hydrophobic spine, and the C‑helix play pivotal roles in the regulation of enzymatic activity. Phosphorylation of the activation loop residue (Y511) by upstream kinases such as LCK disrupts autoinhibitory contacts and stabilizes the active conformation of ITK. In addition, autophosphorylation events, including phosphorylation of tyrosine 180 within the SH3 domain, further modulate substrate binding and catalytic efficiency. Structure-based inhibitor design studies, including those employing benzothiazole-based compounds, have underscored the importance of the ATP‑binding pocket within the kinase domain for achieving high specificity toward ITK (mackinnon2013structurebaseddesignand pages 5-5, huang2014functionofil2induciblec pages 11-15).\n\n6. Regulation  \nITK activity is governed by a series of regulatory mechanisms that ensure its activity is tightly coupled to T‑cell receptor (TCR) engagement. In resting T cells, intramolecular interactions among the PH, TH, SH3, and SH2 domains maintain ITK in an autoinhibited, closed conformation. Upon TCR stimulation, activation of PI3 kinase results in the generation of PIP₃ at the plasma membrane, allowing the PH domain of ITK to bind these lipids and drive its translocation to the membrane where its substrates are located (hsu2023selectiveinhibitionof pages 3-5, zhong2014targetinginterleukin2inducibletcell pages 11-13).  \nThe next critical step in ITK activation is mediated by LCK, a Src family kinase that phosphorylates the activation loop tyrosine (Y511) within the kinase domain. This phosphorylation event relieves autoinhibitory contacts and primes ITK for full catalytic activity. Subsequent autophosphorylation on additional sites, such as tyrosine 180 in the SH3 domain, further enhances ITK’s enzymatic activity and its ability to engage with adaptor proteins (devkota2017anautoinhibitoryrole pages 3-4, kannan2015requirementforitk pages 9-11, hsu2023selectiveinhibitionof pages 16-20).  \nMoreover, allosteric regulation is achieved through conformational shifts that are induced upon ligand binding and intramolecular domain rearrangement. The interplay between the PH domain and the catalytic domain, together with the disruption of autoinhibitory interactions mediated by the SH3 and proline‑rich regions, facilitates the transition of ITK from a closed, inactive state to an open, active conformation (devkota2017anautoinhibitoryrole pages 22-23, hsu2023selectiveinhibitionof pages 16-20).\n\n7. Function  \nITK is an indispensable mediator of adaptive immune response, with its function predominantly linked to T‑cell receptor (TCR) signaling. ITK is selectively expressed in T lymphocytes, including conventional αβ T cells, gamma‑delta T cells, and natural killer T (NKT) cells, and its expression is pivotal for the development, differentiation, and function of these cells. Following antigen recognition by T cells, ITK is rapidly recruited to the plasma membrane where it becomes activated through phosphorylation by LCK. Once activated, ITK phosphorylates several key substrates that facilitate further signal propagation. For example, the phosphorylation of phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLCG1) by ITK activates its lipase activity, leading to the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5‑bisphosphate (PIP₂) into the second messengers inositol trisphosphate (IP₃) and diacylglycerol (DAG). The resulting IP₃ triggers the release of Ca²⁺ from the endoplasmic reticulum, which in turn supports sustained calcium influx and the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NFAT necessary for lymphokine production (zhong2014targetinginterleukin2inducibletcell pages 11-13).  \nIn addition to PLCG1, ITK phosphorylates adaptor proteins such as LAT and LCP2 (also known as SLP‑76), which function as scaffolds to recruit other signaling molecules—including VAV1—thereby amplifying signals that drive T‑cell proliferation and differentiation. Furthermore, ITK also targets the transcription factor TBX21 (T‑bet) at Tyr‑530; this post‑translational modification modulates TBX21’s interaction with GATA3, thereby influencing the differentiation program of T‑helper cells. Collectively, these phosphorylation events are essential for mediating intracellular signaling that controls cytokine production, T‑cell proliferation, and the differentiation of naïve T cells into specialized subsets (zhong2014targetinginterleukin2inducibletcell pages 11-13, kannan2015requirementforitk pages 8-9, huang2014functionofil2induciblea pages 11-15, lechner2020roleofthe pages 7-8).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nGiven the central role of ITK in T‑cell activation and adaptive immunity, the kinase has emerged as a critical target for pharmaceutical intervention in immune‑mediated disorders. Several selective inhibitors have been developed targeting ITK’s ATP‑binding site, including both covalent and non‑covalent compounds. Structure‑based drug design studies have led to the development of benzothiazole‑based inhibitors, which demonstrate sub‑nanomolar potency and high specificity by interacting with residues that are unique to ITK’s active site (kaur2012inhibitorsofinterleukin2 pages 1-2, mackinnon2013structurebaseddesignand pages 5-5, hsu2023selectiveinhibitionof pages 14-16). Dysregulation of ITK activity has been implicated in a range of immune‑mediated disorders, including autoimmune diseases, allergic asthma, and certain lymphoproliferative disorders. In clinical and pre‑clinical studies, abnormal ITK signaling has been associated with conditions in which T‑cell activation is misregulated, and ITK deficiency or altered activity can lead to immunodeficiency phenotypes characterized by impaired T‑cell activation. As such, pharmacological modulation of ITK is seen as a promising strategy to correct aberrant T‑cell responses in diseases where excessive or deficient immune activation is observed (lechner2020roleofthe pages 7-8, kaur2012inhibitorsofinterleukin2 pages 1-2, hsu2023selectiveinhibitionof pages 14-16).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTEC (UniProt P42680) is a member of the Tec family of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases, a group that is evolutionarily conserved among metazoans and traces its origins to early premetazoan ancestors. The Tec family—comprising Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), interleukin‐2–inducible T cell kinase (ITK), TEC, TXK/RLK, and BMX—forms a distinct clade within the human kinome that is separate from other families such as the Src or Abl kinases (ortutay2008phylogenyoftec pages 18-20). Orthologs of TEC and its close relatives have been identified across vertebrate species, and phylogenetic analyses have established that the diversification of the Tec family occurred early in animal evolution, thereby serving as an ancient signaling module that has been maintained through subsequent evolutionary events (smith2001thetecfamily pages 5-7, miller2002newinsightsinto pages 1-2). This evolutionary conservation underscores the critical regulatory roles that Tec kinases have assumed in various cellular contexts, particularly in hematopoietic lineages.\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nTEC catalyzes the phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues on substrate proteins by transferring a phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of tyrosine, thereby generating ADP, a phosphorylated tyrosine residue on the substrate, and a proton. In chemical terms, the reaction can be formally described as:  \n  ATP + protein (tyrosine residue) → ADP + protein (phosphotyrosine) + H⁺  \nThis catalytic activity constitutes the fundamental biochemical reaction of all protein tyrosine kinases and is a key post‐translational modification that modulates signal transduction events in cells (nore2003identificationofphosphorylation pages 1-2, miller2002newinsightsinto pages 10-10).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nLike most kinases, TEC requires divalent metal ions—most notably Mg²⁺—as cofactors. The presence of Mg²⁺ is essential for the proper binding of ATP within the active site of TEC, thereby enabling the phosphate transfer reaction to proceed efficiently. Although detailed studies on the cofactor requirements of TEC specifically have not been extensively elaborated in the provided literature, the requirement of Mg²⁺ is a well‐documented feature for the catalytic activities of protein kinases in general (amatya2019lipidtargetingpleckstrinhomology pages 1-1, nore2003identificationofphosphorylation pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nTEC has an intrinsic substrate specificity that is characteristic of tyrosine kinases. It phosphorylates tyrosine residues located within substrates that are typically involved in receptor signaling pathways and immune cell activation. Although no single consensus motif has been defined solely for TEC, studies of related Tec family members indicate that substrate recognition is mediated by direct engagement of docking surfaces provided by the SH2 and SH3 domains in conjunction with the active site of the kinase. This docking mechanism favors substrates that contain proline‐rich regions and phosphorylated motifs, ensuring selective phosphorylation of signaling proteins such as DOK1, CD28-specific substrates, STAP1, and GRB10 among others (joseph2010identificationofan pages 6-8, nore2003identificationofphosphorylation pages 1-2, bradshaw2010thesrcsyk pages 7-9).\n\n5. Structure  \nTEC is organized into a modular architecture that is typical of Tec family kinases. Its domain organization is as follows: an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a Tec homology (TH) domain, an SH3 domain, an SH2 domain, and a C-terminal kinase (SH1) domain.\n\n• The PH domain (located at the N-terminus) binds phosphoinositides such as phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) and is responsible for localizing TEC to the plasma membrane in response to PI3K activation. In addition to mediating membrane association, the PH domain can also partake in autoinhibitory interactions by occluding the substrate-docking and activation regions of the kinase domain (amatya2019lipidtargetingpleckstrinhomology pages 5-6).  \n• Following the PH domain, the TH domain typically contains a zinc-binding Btk motif and a proline-rich region. This domain contributes to both the structural stability of the molecule and to regulatory protein–protein interactions that fine-tune kinase activity (smith2001thetecfamily pages 1-2, ortutay2008phylogenyoftec pages 4-7).  \n• The SH3 domain serves to bind polyproline motifs, often within the same molecule (intramolecular) or on interacting proteins (intermolecular), and plays a critical role in ensuring proper conformational arrangements necessary for TEC activation (smith2001thetecfamily pages 3-5, brazin2000aspecificintermolecular pages 16-17).  \n• The SH2 domain is responsible for binding phosphotyrosine-containing sequences on substrate or adaptor proteins, thereby contributing to the specificity and fidelity of the downstream signaling cascades.  \n• Finally, the C-terminal kinase (SH1) domain, which contains the catalytic machinery, adopts a bi-lobal structure. The smaller N-terminal lobe mainly consists of β-sheets while the larger C-terminal lobe is predominantly α-helical. Key regulatory features within this kinase domain include:\n  – An activation loop whose phosphorylation is critical for full catalytic activation.\n  – A conserved C-helix that, together with the active site lysine, forms essential interactions for ATP binding and catalysis.\n  – An extended regulatory spine that helps maintain the structural integrity of the active state.\nStructural studies, including crystallographic data from related family members and high-confidence AlphaFold models, further support that TEC’s catalytic domain adopts the classical protein kinase fold, modulated by dynamic interdomain interactions which underlie its switching between inactive and active states (smith2001thetecfamily pages 5-7, ortutay2008phylogenyoftec pages 7-10, bradshaw2010thesrcsyk pages 6-6).\n\n6. Regulation  \nTEC activity is subject to multilayered regulation that operates at both the biochemical and conformational levels. One of the primary regulatory features is autoinhibition, which is mediated by the N-terminal PH domain directly interacting with the kinase domain. This interaction masks essential catalytic and substrate-docking sites, thus preventing premature activation. Engagement of the PH domain with PIP3 relieves this autoinhibition by prompting a conformational rearrangement that promotes membrane localization and subsequent activation of the kinase (amatya2019lipidtargetingpleckstrinhomology pages 5-6).  \nIn addition to relief from autoinhibition, TEC’s activity is modulated by phosphorylation events. The activation loop within the kinase domain contains a critical tyrosine residue whose phosphorylation is essential for full catalytic activity; this phosphorylation can be mediated by Src family kinases as well as by autophosphorylation (joseph2010identificationofan pages 6-8, miller2002newinsightsinto pages 7-8). Phosphorylation within the SH3 domain has also been documented in related Tec kinases, which affects the ability of the SH3 domain to engage with proline-rich motifs and consequently influences downstream signaling dynamics (nore2003identificationofphosphorylation pages 1-2, bradshaw2010thesrcsyk pages 7-9). Furthermore, allosteric regulation through shifts in the hydrophobic spine and repositioning of the C-helix contributes to fine-tuning TEC’s enzymatic activity. These collective regulatory mechanisms ensure that TEC activity is tightly restricted to conditions where receptor-mediated PI3K activation generates the appropriate lipid signals, thereby maintaining fidelity in immune and other signaling pathways (bradshaw2010thesrcsyk pages 5-6, joseph2010identificationofan pages 6-8).\n\n7. Function  \nTEC functions as a versatile signal transducer in multiple receptor-mediated pathways. It plays multiple, sometimes redundant, roles in both adaptive and innate immune responses. In T lymphocytes, TEC functions redundantly with ITK to regulate conventional T-cell development and function as well as the differentiation of nonconventional natural killer T (NKT) cells. It is required for T cell receptor (TCR)-dependent interleukin-2 (IL2) gene induction and also phosphorylates substrates such as DOK1 and specific CD28 substrates, contributing to CD28-dependent signaling events (amatya2019lipidtargetingpleckstrinhomology pages 1-1, 5-6, 6-6).  \nIn B lymphocytes, TEC acts redundantly with BTK in mediating B cell receptor (BCR) signaling, notably through the phosphorylation of STAP1, thereby influencing B-cell development and activation. TEC’s role in these lymphocyte lineages is integral to controlling adaptive immune responses. Moreover, TEC is required in mast cells where it facilitates efficient cytokine production, and it participates in myeloid signaling downstream of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (CSF3), which is fundamental to the growth, differentiation, and activation of myeloid cells (miller2002newinsightsinto pages 6-7, mihara2007roleoftxk pages 1-4).  \nBeyond its roles in immune cells, TEC is involved in platelet signaling downstream of integrin activation and G protein-coupled receptor engagement, thereby contributing to hemostatic and thrombotic processes (amatya2019lipidtargetingpleckstrinhomology pages 6-6, bradshaw2010thesrcsyk pages 7-9). TEC also functions in hepatocytes where it is implicated in proliferation and liver regeneration via the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-induced ERK signaling pathway. In addition, TEC regulates unconventional secretion of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) by phosphorylating its Tyr-215 and is proposed to be involved in osteoclast differentiation, linking it to bone remodeling processes (amatya2019lipidtargetingpleckstrinhomology pages 1-1, 5-6). Together, these roles illustrate that TEC is a multifunctional kinase participating in diverse signaling networks that govern cellular activation, proliferation, differentiation, and cytoskeletal rearrangements (smith2001thetecfamily pages 1-2, 3-5, miller2002newinsightsinto pages 7-8).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nTEC, as a member of the Tec family, is of considerable interest as a potential therapeutic target due to its extensive roles in immune regulation and cellular signaling. Although specific inhibitors designed exclusively for TEC are not well established, the clinical success of BTK inhibitors in various hematological malignancies underscores the therapeutic relevance of targeting Tec kinase activity. The functional redundancy observed between TEC and related kinases such as ITK in T cells and BTK in B cells indicates that modulation of TEC could have wide-ranging impacts on both adaptive and innate immune responses. Furthermore, disease associations linked to mutations in Tec family members—most notably BTK mutations leading to X-linked agammaglobulinemia—highlight the critical nature of these kinases in immune homeostasis and suggest that perturbations in TEC function might contribute to immunodeficiencies or inflammatory conditions. As such, further research to delineate the precise substrate spectrum, regulatory mechanisms, and potential for selective inhibition of TEC is warranted (bradshaw2010thesrcsyk pages 7-9, smith2001thetecfamily pages 7-9, miller2002newinsightsinto pages 7-8).\n\n9.

Regulates the development, function and differentiation of conventional T-cells and nonconventional NKT-cells. When antigen presenting cells (APC) activate T-cell receptor (TCR), a series of phosphorylation leads to the recruitment of TXK to the cell membrane, where it is phosphorylated at Tyr-420. Phosphorylation leads to TXK full activation. Also contributes to signaling from many receptors and participates in multiple downstream pathways, including regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Like ITK, can phosphorylate PLCG1, leading to its localization in lipid rafts and activation, followed by subsequent cleavage of its substrates. In turn, the endoplasmic reticulum releases calcium in the cytoplasm and the nuclear activator of activated T-cells (NFAT) translocates into the nucleus to perform its transcriptional duty. Plays a role in the positive regulation of IFNG transcription in T-helper 1 cells as part of an IFNG promoter-binding complex with PARP1 and EEF1A1 (PubMed:11859127, PubMed:17177976). Within the complex, phosphorylates both PARP1 and EEF1A1 (PubMed:17177976). Also phosphorylates key sites in LCP2 leading to the up-regulation of Th1 preferred cytokine IL-2. Phosphorylates 'Tyr-201' of CTLA4 which leads to the association of PI-3 kinase with the CTLA4 receptor**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‑protein kinase TXK (gene TXK; also known as PTK4 or RLK) is classified in the Tec family of non‑receptor tyrosine kinases, a group that plays critical roles in immune cell signaling. Orthologs of TXK are conserved among mammalian species and are part of an evolutionary lineage that arose in early vertebrates, where the regulation of T‑cell receptor (TCR)–mediated responses represents an essential function. Unlike its Tec family relatives such as interleukin‑2‑inducible kinase (Itk), Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (Btk) and bone marrow expressed kinase (Bmx), TXK is unique because it lacks an amino‑terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain; instead, TXK contains a short N‑terminal region that is rich in proline and cysteine residues. This distinct N‑terminal feature clearly differentiates TXK from other Tec kinases that rely on their PH domain for membrane anchoring and phospholipid interactions. Phylogenetic analyses based on the conserved SH3, SH2, and catalytic kinase (SH1) domains place TXK in a specific sub‑branch within the Tec family, which is principally involved in T‑cell receptor signaling. Functionally, TXK appears to share redundant roles with Itk, underscoring the evolutionary conservation of mechanisms regulating T‑cell activation and differentiation (bolen1997leukocyteproteintyrosine pages 6-9, mamand2018characterisinginterleukin2induciblekinase pages 32-35, mahajan1995srcfamilyprotein pages 7-8).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nTyrosine‑protein kinase TXK catalyzes the phosphorylation reaction in which a phosphate group is transferred from ATP to the hydroxyl group of a tyrosine residue on a specific substrate protein. The chemical reaction can be represented as:  \nATP + protein–L‑tyrosine → ADP + protein–L‑tyrosine‑phosphate + H⁺  \nThis reaction is fundamental to the regulation of protein activity and is typical of all protein tyrosine kinases (template).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of TXK, in common with other tyrosine kinases, is dependent on the presence of divalent metal cations. In particular, Mg²⁺ is required as a cofactor to properly orient the ATP substrate within the active site and to stabilize the transition state during phosphate transfer (template).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nTXK phosphorylates several substrates that are critical components of the T‑cell activation signaling cascade. Its substrate specificity is not governed solely by the short linear sequence motifs surrounding the target tyrosine residues; rather, it is also defined by long‑range docking interactions mediated by its non‑catalytic domains. For instance, TXK can phosphorylate phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLCG1) at residues analogous to those modified by related Tec kinases, thereby promoting PLCG1’s localization to lipid rafts where it becomes activated. This activation eventually results in the cleavage of phospholipids, intracellular calcium release, and the nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor of activated T‑cells (NFAT) (min2008interleukin2tyrosinekinasesubstrate pages 35-39, min2008interleukin2tyrosinekinasesubstrate pages 73-78). In addition, TXK phosphorylates key proteins such as lymphocyte cytosolic protein 2 (LCP2) to up‑regulate interleukin‑2 (IL‑2) production, and it targets specific tyrosine residues such as Tyr‑201 in CTLA4, which leads to the association of phosphoinositide‑3‑kinase (PI‑3 kinase) with the receptor (bolen1997leukocyteproteintyrosine pages 9-11, min2008interleukin2tyrosinekinasesubstrate pages 39-44). Biochemical investigations of related Tec family kinases have demonstrated that substrate recognition often relies on docking interfaces that are independent of phosphotyrosine binding. In such cases, the substrate’s own SH2 domain may engage complementary charged surfaces on the kinase domain, thereby enhancing both specificity and catalytic efficiency (min2008interleukin2tyrosinekinasesubstrate pages 57-63).\n\n5. Structure  \nTXK exhibits a modular domain architecture characteristic of the Tec family. Its overall structure is organized into distinct regions that contribute both to substrate recognition and catalytic activity.  \n• At the extreme N‑terminus, TXK contains a short region that is uniquely proline‑ and cysteine‑rich. This region is a marked deviation from other Tec kinases, which generally contain an amino‑terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain for lipid binding and membrane localization. The absence of the PH domain in TXK suggests that alternative mechanisms, possibly mediated by protein–protein interactions involving the proline‑ and cysteine‑rich segment, may be responsible for its subcellular targeting (bolen1997leukocyteproteintyrosine pages 6-9, mahajan1995srcfamilyprotein pages 7-8).  \n• Following this unique N‑terminal region is the SH3 domain, which typically binds proline‑rich sequences (PxxP motifs) in interacting proteins and also plays a role in intramolecular contacts that can influence kinase activity.  \n• Adjacent to the SH3 domain is the SH2 domain. In typical tyrosine kinases, the SH2 domain binds phosphotyrosine‑containing peptides; however, in TXK, similar to other Tec family members, the SH2 domain may participate in non‑canonical docking interactions that contribute to substrate specificity without strict reliance on phosphotyrosine binding (min2008interleukin2tyrosinekinasesubstrate pages 35-39, min2008interleukin2tyrosinekinasesubstrate pages 73-78).  \n• The C‑terminal region of TXK comprises the kinase (SH1) domain, which is responsible for the catalytic activity of phosphoryl transfer. This kinase domain includes characteristic structural elements such as the activation loop, which requires phosphorylation (notably at Tyr‑420 in TXK) to achieve full catalytic competence, the C‑helix, and the hydrophobic regulatory spine. Recent analyses of related Tec kinases have shown that proper alignment of these structures is critical for activity and that intramolecular interactions between the SH2 and kinase domains can stabilize the active state (min2008interleukin2tyrosinekinasesubstrate pages 63-73, joseph2010identificationofan pages 6-8).  \nAlthough no high‑resolution crystal structure of TXK is currently available in the provided context, structural insights derived from biochemical studies and from AlphaFold models of related Tec kinases indicate that its kinase domain adopts the typical two‑lobed structure common to tyrosine kinases. The N‑lobe, primarily composed of β‑sheets and a critical C‑helix, and the C‑lobe, predominantly α‑helical and containing the activation loop, are arranged so that the catalytic cleft can accommodate ATP and substrate proteins in an optimal geometry (bolen1997leukocyteproteintyrosine pages 6-9, min2008interleukin2tyrosinekinasesubstrate pages 44-48).\n\n6. Regulation  \nTXK is regulated by several interlinked mechanisms that ensure its kinase activity is tightly coupled to immune receptor engagement. One major regulatory mechanism is phosphorylation. Upon activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and subsequent engagement of the T‑cell receptor, TXK is recruited to the plasma membrane where it undergoes phosphorylation at Tyr‑420, a modification that is essential for full activation of its kinase domain (mamand2018characterisinginterleukin2induciblekinase pages 211-214). In addition to phosphorylation, TXK function is modulated by docking interactions that involve non‑canonical binding interfaces. Studies on related Tec kinases have shown that substrate docking can occur through interactions between the SH2 domain of the substrate and complementary charged surfaces on the kinase domain; such interactions enhance phosphorylation efficiency, even when the local sequence motifs are not optimal (min2008interleukin2tyrosinekinasesubstrate pages 35-39, min2008interleukin2tyrosinekinasesubstrate pages 73-78). Furthermore, conformational regulation is a key element in TXK activation. The assembly of the hydrophobic regulatory spine within the kinase domain—stabilized through intramolecular contacts involving the SH2 and kinase domains—ensures that TXK remains catalytically competent only when appropriate upstream signals are present. This allosteric control mechanism has been supported by structural analyses of Tec kinases and is critical for preventing aberrant activation (joseph2010identificationofan pages 6-8).\n\n7. Function  \nTXK functions as a non‑receptor tyrosine kinase that is predominantly expressed in T‑lymphocytes, where it plays a central role in the initiation and propagation of T‑cell receptor signaling. Functionally, TXK acts redundantly with Itk to regulate the development, activation, and differentiation of conventional T‑cells as well as non‑conventional natural killer T (NKT) cells. Upon antigen recognition by the T‑cell receptor, a cascade of phosphorylation events is initiated, and TXK is recruited to the cell membrane where it becomes phosphorylated at Tyr‑420, triggering its full activation. One of the hallmark substrates of TXK is phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLCG1); phosphorylation of PLCG1 by TXK facilitates its translocation to lipid rafts and promotes the hydrolysis of phosphoinositides, leading to an increase in intracellular calcium and the nuclear import of NFAT. This signaling cascade is essential for subsequent transcriptional events, such as the expression of cytokines that drive T‑cell responses (min2008interleukin2tyrosinekinasesubstrate pages 35-39, min2008interleukin2tyrosinekinasesubstrate pages 78-82). In addition to PLCG1, TXK phosphorylates other key proteins involved in immune regulation. For instance, phosphorylation of lymphocyte cytosolic protein 2 (LCP2) by TXK contributes to up‑regulation of IL‑2 production—a cytokine critical for T‑cell proliferation—and phosphorylation of CTLA4 at Tyr‑201 facilitates the recruitment of PI‑3 kinase, thereby modulating inhibitory signaling pathways. TXK is also involved in the regulation of interferon‑γ (IFNG) gene expression in T‑helper 1 (Th1) cells, where it forms part of a promoter‑binding complex that includes PARP1 and EEF1A1. Within this complex, TXK phosphorylates both PARP1 and EEF1A1, events that are instrumental in the transcriptional activation of IFNG (mamand2018characterisinginterleukin2induciblekinase pages 32-35, bolen1997leukocyteproteintyrosine pages 6-9, siveen2018roleofnon pages 6-8).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nTXK is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in immune‑mediated disorders and certain hematological malignancies owing to its pivotal role in T‑cell activation and cytokine regulation. Although selective inhibitors that target TXK specifically have not been as extensively characterized as those for its close homolog Itk, there is considerable interest in developing molecules that modulate Tec family kinase activity. The unique structural feature of TXK—its lack of a PH domain—may provide an opportunity for the design of selective agents that disrupt critical protein–protein interactions or substrate docking interfaces unique to TXK. Dysregulation of Tec family kinase signaling, including that mediated by TXK, has been implicated in autoimmune diseases and T‑cell malignancies; however, mutations directly affecting TXK are not as widely reported, and its functional redundancy with Itk suggests that overall perturbations in Tec signaling may underlie pathological conditions (mamand2018characterisinginterleukin2induciblekinase pages 32-35, bolen1997leukocyteproteintyrosine pages 6-9).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase FRK, also known as PTK5 or RAK, is a member of the BRK family of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases that exhibits strong evolutionary linkage with the Src family kinases. Evidence from phylogenetic analyses indicates that FRK is conserved across vertebrate species, with orthologs identified in all mammalian lineages. Its evolutionary ancestry can be traced back to early metazoans, and comparative studies place FRK in a subgroup that, while bearing the canonical modular architecture characteristic of Src family kinases, diverges in specific features such as the absence of membrane‐anchoring signals. In contrast to its classical Src relatives, FRK lacks an N-terminal myristoylation signal and palmitoylation sites, thereby favoring a soluble cytosolic distribution over the membrane-associated configuration seen in many Src kinases (Superti‐Furga1995structure‐functionrelationshipsin pages 4-5, Martellucci2020srcfamilykinases pages 2-4). Furthermore, while other members such as SRC, FYN, and YES share a core set of regulatory mechanisms derived from a common ancestral kinase, FRK’s sequence contains distinguishing motifs within its SH2 domain—including a nuclear localization signal—that suggest the evolution of additional regulatory layers tailored for selective substrate interaction and intracellular distribution. This distinctive phylogenetic trajectory is supported by our current understanding of the kinase complement in the human genome, as described in landmark studies of protein kinase evolution, which underscore FRK’s assignment within the broader Src‐like kinase superfamily (Superti‐Furga1995structure‐functionrelationshipsin pages 4-5, Martellucci2020srcfamilykinases pages 2-4).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nFRK catalyzes the transfer of the γ-phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the hydroxyl group of tyrosine residues on specific protein substrates. The chemical reaction can be summarized as follows: ATP + [protein]–tyrosine → ADP + [protein]–phosphotyrosine + H⁺. This phosphorylation event is characteristic of protein tyrosine kinases and serves as a crucial regulatory mechanism in signal transduction pathways, modifying substrate conformation and interaction potential (Fan2015proteintyrosinephosphataseand pages 14-14).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe enzymatic activity of FRK is dependent on ATP, which serves as the phosphate donor for the phosphorylation reaction. In addition to ATP, magnesium ions (Mg²⁺) are required as a cofactor; these divalent cations coordinate with ATP to create the proper conformation for effective binding within the kinase catalytic pocket. The presence of Mg²⁺ is essential for aligning the γ-phosphate of ATP in proximity to the substrate tyrosine's hydroxyl group, thereby facilitating efficient phosphoryl transfer (Byeon2012theroleof pages 2-3, Martellucci2020srcfamilykinases pages 2-4).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nFRK displays substrate specificity that is reflective of its role in regulating critical signaling proteins. One of the best characterized substrates of FRK is the tumor suppressor protein PTEN, for which FRK catalyzes phosphorylation at tyrosine residue 336. This modification of PTEN is of functional significance because it results in the stabilization of PTEN by preventing its ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In addition to PTEN, FRK has been shown to phosphorylate other substrates, including components of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) complex and BRCA1, thereby influencing receptor internalization and the stability of proteins involved in genomic maintenance. Experimental investigations have identified consensus substrate motifs for FRK that include sequences with marked amino acid preferences, such as the motif HFpYENI, which appears in some substrates and delineates FRK’s specificity toward particular phosphotyrosine contexts (Jimura2021kinomeprofilinganalysis pages 8-8, Siveen2018roleofnon pages 8-9).\n\n5. Structure  \nThe primary structure of FRK comprises 505 amino acids arranged into canonical functional domains that are typical of Src-related kinases but with distinct differences that contribute to its unique cellular functions. At the N-terminus, FRK contains an SH3 domain that mediates protein-protein interactions by binding to proline-rich motifs present in target proteins. Following the SH3 domain, FRK harbors an SH2 domain which is instrumental in recognizing and binding phosphotyrosine-containing peptides; notably, this domain includes a nuclear localization signal (NLS) that directs a fraction of FRK to the nucleus, thereby influencing its subcellular localization and activity profile. The C-terminal region consists of the catalytic kinase domain (often referred to as the SH1 domain), which adopts the conserved bilobed structure typical of protein kinases. Within this domain, key residues are responsible for catalytic function: a conserved lysine (Lys262) is critical for ATP binding, while autophosphorylation at Tyr387 within the activation loop is essential for full activation of the kinase. An inhibitory tyrosine residue, Tyr497, located in the C-terminal tail, is analogous to the regulatory sites found in classic Src family kinases; phosphorylation at this residue facilitates intramolecular interactions that stabilize an inactive conformation. The absence of lipid modification signals, such as N-myristoylation and palmitoylation motifs, differentiates FRK from other Src family members that target membranes, conferring FRK a broader cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution (Superti‐Furga1995structure‐functionrelationshipsin pages 4-5, McClendon2020structurefunctionand pages 1-3). Furthermore, the three-dimensional structural organization as predicted by methods such as AlphaFold suggests that FRK maintains the canonical kinase fold, with a regulatory spine and a conserved C-helix that are central to its conformational regulation during the switch between inactive and active states (McClendon2020structurefunctionand pages 11-13).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulatory mechanisms governing FRK activity are multifaceted, relying on both intramolecular domain interactions and post-translational modifications that fine-tune its catalytic output. A central mechanism of regulation involves autophosphorylation: phosphorylation at Tyr387 located within the activation loop of the kinase domain increases FRK’s enzymatic activity by promoting a conformational change that aligns catalytic residues for efficient phosphoryl transfer. Conversely, phosphorylation at Tyr497 in the C-terminal tail functions as an inhibitory modification. This phosphorylation event creates a docking site for the SH2 domain of FRK itself, thereby fostering an intramolecular interaction that shifts the protein into an autoinhibited conformation. In addition to these phosphorylation events, the SH2 domain’s inherent ability to bind phosphotyrosine-containing motifs of partner proteins also plays a role in modulating FRK signaling output by influencing substrate recruitment and subcellular localization. Notably, the presence of a nuclear localization signal within the SH2 domain further complicates the regulatory landscape by enabling a dynamic distribution between cytosolic and nuclear compartments based on its phosphorylation status and interacting partners. These allosteric and conformational regulatory mechanisms underscore the precision with which FRK activity is controlled, ensuring that its kinase function is appropriately modulated in response to various extracellular and intracellular signals (Byeon2012theroleof pages 2-3, McClendon2020structurefunctionand pages 11-13, Martellucci2020srcfamilykinases pages 2-4).\n\n7. Function  \nFunctionally, FRK serves as a non-receptor tyrosine kinase with significant roles in the regulation of cell proliferation, survival, and genomic stability. One of the most critical functions attributed to FRK is its ability to act as a tumor suppressor by phosphorylating the tumor suppressor protein PTEN. By phosphorylating PTEN on Tyr336, FRK enhances PTEN stability, thereby reducing its susceptibility to ubiquitination and degradation mediated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4. This stabilization of PTEN is pivotal in maintaining appropriate levels of PI3K/AKT signaling, a pathway essential for controlling cell growth and survival. In addition to its action on PTEN, FRK also influences other substrates such as EGFR and BRCA1. Phosphorylation of EGFR on specific tyrosine residues modulates receptor internalization and downstream signaling, while modification of BRCA1 is implicated in preserving genomic integrity by preventing its premature degradation. Expression of FRK is predominantly found in epithelial tissues, including those of the breast, where its function correlates with the suppression of oncogenic processes. Loss or mutation of FRK has been associated with the development of cancers such as breast carcinoma and glioma, reflecting its dual role in cellular proliferation and differentiation as well as in tumor suppression. Moreover, FRK participates in major signaling cascades including those mediated by STAT3, JNK, and PI3K/AKT, thereby influencing processes such as cell migration, invasion, and apoptosis. The integrated function of FRK thus encompasses a broad regulation of cellular homeostasis, linking its enzymatic activity to the control of critical checkpoints in cell cycle progression and signal transduction pathways (Jimura2021kinomeprofilinganalysis pages 8-8, Martellucci2020srcfamilykinases pages 2-4, Park2021thenonreceptortyrosine pages 1-2, Siveen2018roleofnon pages 8-9).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nAlthough specific inhibitors that selectively target FRK have not yet been as extensively characterized as those for other members of the Src family, the structural similarities shared with its kin group suggest that inhibitors developed for Src family kinases may also impact FRK activity. Several cancer-associated mutations of FRK, including point mutations such as R64P, K265R, and N359I as well as deletion mutations such as the VF deletion within the kinase domain, have been identified in various tumor types. These mutations have been demonstrated to variably alter FRK’s kinase activity; some mutations lead to reduced or abolished activity resulting in loss of tumor suppressor function, while others may increase kinase activity under specific contexts. The identification and functional characterization of these mutations highlight the molecular heterogeneity of FRK in cancer and provide a basis for future therapeutic strategies that could either restore its tumor suppressive activity or counteract any potential oncogenic gain-of-function effects. Moreover, the dual nature of FRK—as a tumor suppressor in some cellular contexts and a potential oncogene in others—underscores the complexity of its role in cancer biology and emphasizes the need to consider tissue-specific expression and mutation status when evaluating therapeutic interventions. Inhibitor development efforts, while still in their early stages for FRK, are guided by structural studies that reveal unique aspects of its catalytic domain and regulatory interfaces. In addition, the broad intracellular distribution of FRK, owing largely to its soluble nature, suggests that its substrate repertoire may be more extensive compared with membrane-tethered Src family kinases. Taken together, these findings establish FRK as a significant player in cellular signaling with important implications in oncogenic processes, and they call for further research into the development of potent and selective inhibitors for clinical application (Martellucci2020srcfamilykinases pages 2-4, Park2021thenonreceptortyrosine pages 1-2, Fan2015proteintyrosinephosphataseand pages 14-14, Siveen2018roleofnon pages 8-9, Neul2016impactofmembrane pages 9-9).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase Fgr is a member of the Src family kinases, which comprise a well‐conserved group of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases that arose early in eukaryotic evolution and are present in all metazoans. Fgr is closely related to other myeloid-specific Src family members such as Hck and Lyn and is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells including neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and mast cells (sen2011regulationofsrc pages 1-2, hatakeyama1994themurinecfgr pages 1-2). Phylogenetic analyses place Fgr within the core set of Src family kinases that descended from a common ancestor shared with other Src members, reflecting both conserved catalytic domains and divergent regulatory and N-terminal sequences that confer cell-specific roles (hatakeyama1994themurinecfgr pages 1-2, fumagalli2007thesrcfamily pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nFgr catalyzes the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on target proteins by transferring the γ-phosphate from ATP to the hydroxyl group of a tyrosine residue in substrate proteins. In precise biochemical terms, the catalytic reaction is described as: ATP + [protein]-L-tyrosine → ADP + [protein]-L-tyrosine-phosphate + H⁺ (kemble2009abiochemicalstudy pages 146-150).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of Fgr, like that of other Src family kinases, is dependent on the presence of Mg²⁺ ions. Magnesium acts as an essential cofactor by coordinating the ATP substrate and stabilizing the transition state during the phosphoryl transfer reaction (kemble2009abiochemicalstudy pages 146-150).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nFgr preferentially phosphorylates tyrosine residues within substrates that are functionally recognized through phosphotyrosine motifs. Studies of Src family kinases have demonstrated that substrate recognition is mediated by the kinase’s SH2 domain, which interacts with pre-phosphorylated motifs, thereby facilitating secondary phosphorylation events. For example, Fgr has been shown to phosphorylate HS1 only after priming phosphorylation by Syk kinase, with specific targeting of the Tyr-222 residue (brunati1999molecularfeaturesunderlying pages 1-2, brunati1999molecularfeaturesunderlying pages 4-6). In addition, Fgr phosphorylates several signaling intermediates that contain consensus sequences similar to those recognized by other Src kinases, although an explicit consensus motif for Fgr alone has not been universally defined (brunati1999molecularfeaturesunderlying pages 6-7).\n\n5. Structure  \nFgr exhibits the typical domain architecture of Src family kinases, which includes an N-terminal unique region that undergoes myristoylation, an SH3 domain, an SH2 domain, a conserved catalytic kinase domain, and a short C-terminal regulatory region. The N-terminal region, which is less conserved compared to the catalytic core, targets Fgr to membranes through myristoylation and helps determine subcellular localization (hatakeyama1994themurinecfgr pages 3-3, sen2011regulationofsrc pages 1-2). The SH3 domain mediates interactions with proline-rich motifs in substrates and regulatory proteins, while the SH2 domain binds to phosphorylated tyrosine residues in specific sequence contexts to regulate both substrate targeting and intramolecular interactions. The kinase domain contains the catalytic cleft, with conserved residues constituting the activation loop and C-helix that modulate kinase activity through conformational changes and autophosphorylation (kemble2009abiochemicalstudy pages 155-159, hatakeyama1994themurinecfgr pages 3-4). Unique structural features of Fgr include its distinct nonhomologous N-terminal segment and a C-terminal tail that is critical for negative regulation by phosphorylation. These features collectively contribute to both the catalytic efficiency and the regulatory control of Fgr (hatakeyama1994themurinecfgr pages 4-5, kemble2009abiochemicalstudy pages 29-33).\n\n6. Regulation  \nFgr is subjected to a variety of regulatory mechanisms that modulate its kinase activity. Autophosphorylation events within the kinase domain are a central part of activation, while phosphorylation of a conserved C-terminal tyrosine residue by C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) mediates negative regulation by promoting an inactive conformation through intramolecular SH2 domain binding (ruzzene1994regulationofcfgr pages 1-2, kemble2009abiochemicalstudy pages 155-159). In addition, gain-of-function mutations, such as the p.Asp502Gly substitution identified in both murine models and human patients afflicted with autoinflammatory bone disease, alter the regulatory phosphorylation dynamics and disrupt the balance of kinase signaling (abe2019gainoffunctionmutationsin pages 1-1, abe2019gainoffunctionmutationsin pages 2-3). Fgr is also modulated through interactions with adaptor proteins and through its association with cell-surface receptors, such as Fc receptors, where receptor crosslinking triggers enhanced autophosphorylation and catalytic activity (toyoshima1993associationofimmunoglobulin pages 1-2, toyoshima1993associationofimmunoglobulin pages 4-5). Moreover, studies in monocytes have shown that Fgr can interact with Syk kinase via its SH2 domain, leading to inhibition of Syk-dependent signaling pathways in β2 integrin receptor signaling (vines2001inhibitionofβ2 pages 13-13, vines2001inhibitionofβ2 pages 6-7). Collectively, these modifications—mediated by upstream kinases such as Csk, by autophosphorylation, and through protein–protein interactions—allow tight spatial and temporal control over Fgr activity (ruzzene1994regulationofcfgr pages 4-6, abe2019gainoffunctionmutationsin pages 5-6).\n\n7. Function  \nFgr plays a multifaceted role in immune cell signaling by transmitting signals from cell surface receptors that lack intrinsic kinase activity. It is expressed primarily in hematopoietic cells, including neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and mast cells, where it regulates critical responses such as cell adhesion, migration, phagocytosis, and cytoskeletal remodeling. In neutrophils, Fgr is essential for the proper activation of the respiratory burst and for actin cytoskeleton reorganization in response to chemotactic peptides such as fMLP, as it contributes to the phosphorylation of key intermediates like Vav1 and downstream activation of Rac GTPases, which in turn regulate NADPH oxidase activity (fumagalli2007thesrcfamily pages 11-12, fumagalli2007thesrcfamily pages 8-9). In monocytes, Fgr has a dual role; while it supports ITGB1 and ITGB2-mediated signaling required for cell spreading and adhesion, it can function as a negative regulator of β2 integrin signaling and Syk kinase activity under specific conditions, thereby modulating phagocytosis and integrin-mediated cytoskeletal rearrangements (jing2021genedeficiencyor pages 11-12, vines2001inhibitionofβ2 pages 2-3). In the context of mast cells, Fgr contributes to degranulation and the release of inflammatory cytokines by phosphorylating PLD2, which leads to the generation of secondary lipid messengers such as lysophosphatidic acid and diacylglycerol (jing2021genedeficiencyor pages 12-12). Additionally, Fgr phosphorylates several other substrates—including CBL, VAV2, PTK2/FAK1, and HCLS1—thereby linking it to signaling cascades that influence cell survival, proliferation, and migration (fumagalli2007thesrcfamily pages 5-6, weir2018selectiveinhibitionof pages 11-14). Recent studies in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have revealed that Fgr is overexpressed in certain patient subsets and that selective inhibition of Fgr with compounds such as TL02-59 leads to potent suppression of AML cell growth in vitro and in vivo (weir2018selectiveinhibitionof pages 11-14, weir2018selectiveinhibitionof pages 4-8). Hence, Fgr is implicated in both normal immune regulation and in pathological conditions, such as autoinflammatory bone disease, AML, and possibly other immune-related disorders (abe2019gainoffunctionmutationsin pages 1-1, abe2019gainoffunctionmutationsin pages 2-3).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nExperimental inhibitors targeting Src family kinases, including Fgr, have been developed; notably, the N-phenylbenzamide compound TL02-59 exhibits picomolar potency against Fgr and has been shown to effectively suppress AML cell proliferation, highlighting the therapeutic potential of selective Fgr inhibition (weir2018selectiveinhibitionof pages 8-11, weir2018selectiveinhibitionof pages 11-14). Gain-of-function mutations in Fgr, such as the p.Asp502Gly substitution, have been linked to autoinflammatory bone disease in both murine models and human patients, establishing Fgr as a candidate susceptibility gene in these disorders (abe2019gainoffunctionmutationsin pages 1-1, abe2019gainoffunctionmutationsin pages 2-3). In addition, Fgr has been implicated in pathways downstream of Fc receptors, where it modulates immune responses such as IgE-mediated anaphylaxis and cytokine release in mast cells, thus further linking its activity to inflammatory and immune-mediated conditions (toyoshima1993associationofimmunoglobulin pages 1-2, jing2021genedeficiencyor pages 12-12). The kinase’s regulation of integrin signaling in both neutrophils and monocytes underscores its importance in modulating cell adhesion, spreading, and transmigration, processes that are critical during immune surveillance and inflammation (fumagalli2007thesrcfamily pages 9-10, vines2001inhibitionofβ2 pages 5-6). These multiple functional roles, coupled with its conserved domain structure and dynamic regulation by phosphorylation and protein–protein interactions, designate Fgr as a key node in immune cell signaling with significant implications for therapeutic intervention in cancer and autoinflammatory disorders (fumagalli2007thesrcfamily pages 11-12, abe2019gainoffunctionmutationsin pages 5-6).\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Inactive FYN is phosphorylated on its C-terminal tail within the catalytic domain (PubMed:15489916). Following activation by PKA, the protein subsequently associates with PTK2/FAK1, allowing PTK2/FAK1 phosphorylation, activation and targeting to focal adhesions (PubMed:15489916). Involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and motility through phosphorylation of CTNNB1 (beta-catenin) and CTNND1 (delta-catenin) (PubMed:17194753). Regulates cytoskeletal remodeling by phosphorylating several proteins including the actin regulator WAS and the microtubule-associated proteins MAP2 and MAPT (PubMed:14707117, PubMed:15536091). Promotes cell survival by phosphorylating AGAP2/PIKE-A and preventing its apoptotic cleavage (PubMed:16841086). Participates in signal transduction pathways that regulate the integrity of the glomerular slit diaphragm (an essential part of the glomerular filter of the kidney) by phosphorylating several slit diaphragm components including NPHS1, KIRREL1 and TRPC6 (PubMed:14761972, PubMed:18258597, PubMed:19179337). Plays a role in neural processes by phosphorylating DPYSL2, a multifunctional adapter protein within the central nervous system, ARHGAP32, a regulator for Rho family GTPases implicated in various neural functions, and SNCA, a small pre-synaptic protein (PubMed:11162638, PubMed:12788081, PubMed:19652227). Involved in reelin signaling by mediating phosphorylation of DAB1 following reelin (RELN)-binding to its receptor (By similarity). Participates in the downstream signaling pathways that lead to T-cell differentiation and proliferation following T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation (PubMed:22080863). Phosphorylates PTK2B/PYK2 in response to T-cell receptor activation (PubMed:20028775). Also participates in negative feedback regulation of TCR signaling through phosphorylation of PAG1, thereby promoting interaction between PAG1 and CSK and recruitment of CSK to lipid rafts (PubMed:18056706).

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase Fyn is a member of the Src family kinases (SFKs), a group of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases that are conserved across metazoans and are present in all mammalian species (huculeci2016dynamicallycoupledresidues pages 1-2). Fyn shares strong sequence and structural similarity with other Src‐related kinases such as Src, Yes, and Fgr, and is phylogenetically distinct from the Hck‐related subgroup that includes Lyn, Hck, and Lck (register2014sh2catalyticdomainlinker pages 1-3). In addition, the existence of alternatively spliced isoforms––notably Fyn1 and Fyn2 which differ in the length and sequence of the SH2–catalytic domain linker––further supports its evolutionary diversification within the SFK family (brignatz2009alternativesplicingmodulates pages 1-2, register2014sh2catalyticdomainlinker pages 1-3).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nFyn catalyzes a phosphorylation reaction in which a phosphate group is transferred from ATP to a tyrosine residue on a protein substrate, resulting in the formation of ADP, a phosphorylated protein, and a proton (sakkiah2017overviewofthe pages 2-3).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of Fyn requires divalent metal ions as cofactors, with Mg²⁺ being essential for efficient ATP binding and phosphate transfer during the phosphorylation reaction (sakkiah2017overviewofthe pages 2-3).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nFyn phosphorylates protein substrates on tyrosine residues and exhibits substrate specificity that is determined by the presence of specific amino acid motifs surrounding the target tyrosine. For example, Fyn phosphorylates tau protein at Tyr18 and beta‐catenin as well as delta‐catenin, which participate in pathways related to cytoskeletal dynamics and cell adhesion (demuro2022arn25068aversatile pages 1-3, bhaskar2005diseaserelatedmodificationsin pages 1-1). In addition, substrates such as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase enhancer (PIKE-A) are phosphorylated by Fyn to promote cell survival by inhibiting apoptotic cleavage (tang2007srcfamilytyrosinekinase pages 9-10). Although a precise consensus substrate motif for Fyn is not explicitly defined in the available context, the kinase’s activity on substrates with phosphotyrosine motifs indicates it recognizes local sequence elements that facilitate SH2 domain-mediated interactions (brignatz2009alternativesplicingmodulates pages 1-2).\n\n5. Structure  \nFyn is organized into several distinct domains that together facilitate its catalytic and regulatory functions. The protein contains an N-terminal SH4 domain that undergoes fatty acylation (myristoylation and palmitoylation) for membrane targeting, which is critical for its proper localization within specific plasma membrane microdomains such as lipid rafts (ouyang2018sensitivefretbiosensor pages 1-4, jelic2007homologymodelingof pages 1-2). Immediately following the SH4 domain, the SH3 domain mediates protein–protein interactions through binding to proline-rich sequences, while the SH2 domain recognizes phosphotyrosine-containing motifs; both domains play key roles in the autoinhibition and activation of the kinase (register2014sh2catalyticdomainlinker pages 1-3, huculeci2016dynamicallycoupledresidues pages 1-2). The catalytic domain (commonly referred to as SH1) is centrally located and contains the activation loop, an αC helix that contributes to the formation of a hydrophobic spine, and a conserved ATP-binding pocket in which key residues such as those in the hinge region (e.g., Glu343 and Met345) participate in ligand interactions (demuro2022arn25068aversatile pages 1-3, jelic2007homologymodelingof pages 7-7). Fyn also harbors a C-terminal tail that includes regulatory tyrosine residues, which when phosphorylated by Csk contribute to maintaining the protein in an autoinhibited conformation (andoniou2000thecblprotooncogene pages 1-2, register2014sh2catalyticdomainlinker pages 1-3). Structural studies based on homology modelling and X-ray crystallography have provided insights into these domain interactions and the dynamic allosteric coupling between the SH2, SH3, and catalytic domains (jelic2007homologymodelingof pages 2-3, register2014sh2catalyticdomainlinker pages 3-4).\n\n6. Regulation  \nFyn activity is intricately regulated by multiple post-translational modifications and intermolecular interactions. Autoinhibition of Fyn is achieved through intramolecular interactions in which the SH2 domain binds to a phosphorylated tyrosine residue in the C-terminal tail, and the SH3 domain interacts with a proline-rich region in the linker domain; these interactions restrain the catalytic domain and maintain Fyn in a low activity state (register2014sh2catalyticdomainlinker pages 1-3, brignatz2009alternativesplicingmodulates pages 3-5). Activation of Fyn involves dephosphorylation of the inhibitory C-terminal tyrosine and subsequent phosphorylation of the activation loop tyrosine by autophosphorylation, which increases catalytic activity (demuro2022arn25068aversatile pages 1-3, weir2016novelautophosphorylationsites pages 1-3). Additional regulation is provided by alternative splicing that produces isoforms (Fyn1 and Fyn2) with different regulatory properties due to variations in their SH2–catalytic domain linker, thereby altering allosteric coupling and substrate binding potential (brignatz2009alternativesplicingmodulates pages 7-9, register2014sh2catalyticdomainlinker pages 3-4). Negative regulation is also exerted through protein–protein interactions; for instance, the c-Cbl proto-oncogene product binds to Fyn and promotes its ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation (andoniou2000thecblprotooncogene pages 1-2, andoniou2000thecblprotooncogene pages 15-16). Moreover, novel autophosphorylation sites within the SH2 domain, such as Tyr185, Tyr213, and Tyr214, modulate both kinase activity and the phosphotyrosine-binding capacity of the SH2 domain, thus impacting downstream signaling interactions (weir2016novelautophosphorylationsites pages 4-6, weir2016novelautophosphorylationsites pages 9-13). Fyn is further regulated by upstream kinases and phosphatases that modulate its phosphorylation status in response to extracellular signals; for example, C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) phosphorylates the inhibitory tyrosine, while protein kinase A (PKA) has been reported to activate Fyn indirectly by facilitating its association with focal adhesion kinase (PTK2/FAK1) (demuro2022arn25068aversatile pages 1-3, andoniou2000thecblprotooncogene pages 12-13).\n\n7. Function  \nFyn plays multiple roles in diverse biological processes and is expressed in a wide variety of tissues, with particularly high levels in neural and immune cells. In neuronal cells, Fyn regulates cytoskeletal remodeling by phosphorylating microtubule-associated proteins such as MAPT (tau) and MAP2, thereby influencing axon guidance and synaptic plasticity; it also participates in reelin signaling by mediating the phosphorylation of DAB1 (demuro2022arn25068aversatile pages 1-3, brignatz2009alternativesplicingmodulates pages 1-2). In the immune system, Fyn is a critical mediator of T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling, where it phosphorylates substrates such as VAV1 and components of the CD28 pathway, thereby promoting T-cell differentiation and proliferation; Fyn also plays a role in mast cell and natural killer (NK) cell signaling (marotta2022roleoffyn pages 1-1, mkaddem2017lynandfyn pages 1-2). Fyn is involved in integrin-mediated signaling processes that regulate cell adhesion and motility through the phosphorylation of proteins such as CTNNB1 (beta-catenin) and CTNND1 (delta-catenin), which contribute to focal adhesion turnover and cytoskeletal reorganization (demuro2022arn25068aversatile pages 1-3, marotta2022roleoffyn pages 1-3). Additionally, Fyn enhances cell survival by phosphorylating proteins such as AGAP2/PIKE-A, thus preventing apoptotic cleavage and promoting antiapoptotic signaling via the Akt pathway (tang2007srcfamilytyrosinekinase pages 9-10, saminathan2021fynkinasemediatedpkcδ pages 1-2). In the kidney, Fyn is important for maintaining the integrity of the glomerular filter by phosphorylating essential components of the slit diaphragm, including NPHS1 and TRPC6, and in neural tissues, Fyn modulates signal transduction processes that contribute to learning and memory (demuro2022arn25068aversatile pages 1-3, marotta2022roleoffyn pages 15-16).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral small molecule inhibitors that target the ATP‐binding pocket of Fyn have been developed and evaluated for their therapeutic potential. Among these, non-selective agents such as dasatinib and saracatinib have been repurposed for clinical investigation in neurodegenerative disorders and cancers, although their lack of specificity across the Src family limits their clinical utility (marotta2022roleoffyn pages 4-6, comba2020fyntyrosinekinase pages 11-12). Additionally, natural compounds such as rosmarinic acid have been identified as Fyn inhibitors through in silico docking and enzymatic assays, acting by a mixed-type inhibition mechanism that may involve binding to an allosteric site in addition to the canonical ATP-binding pocket (jelic2007homologymodelingof pages 7-8, marotta2022roleoffyn pages 7-9). Disease associations of Fyn include its implication in Alzheimer’s disease due to its role in tau phosphorylation and in various cancers, where its deregulated activity contributes to aberrant cell survival and migration (demuro2022arn25068aversatile pages 1-3, mkaddem2017lynandfyn pages 1-2). Moreover, genetic and biochemical studies have linked Fyn to immune dysfunctions, including defective T-cell receptor signaling and autoimmunity, as well as to neurodevelopmental processes that may impact central nervous system disorders (marotta2022roleoffyn pages 1-1, ouyang2018sensitivefretbiosensor pages 17-20).\n\n9.

Participates in signaling pathways that control a diverse spectrum of biological activities including gene transcription, immune response, cell adhesion, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, migration, and transformation. Due to functional redundancy between members of the SRC kinase family, identification of the specific role of each SRC kinase is very difficult. SRC appears to be one of the primary kinases activated following engagement of receptors and plays a role in the activation of other protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) families. Receptor clustering or dimerization leads to recruitment of SRC to the receptor complexes where it phosphorylates the tyrosine residues within the receptor cytoplasmic domains. Plays an important role in the regulation of cytoskeletal organization through phosphorylation of specific substrates such as AFAP1. Phosphorylation of AFAP1 allows the SRC SH2 domain to bind AFAP1 and to localize to actin filaments. Cytoskeletal reorganization is also controlled through the phosphorylation of cortactin (CTTN) (Probable). When cells adhere via focal adhesions to the extracellular matrix, signals are transmitted by integrins into the cell resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of focal adhesion proteins, including PTK2/FAK1 and paxillin (PXN) (PubMed:21411625). In addition to phosphorylating focal adhesion proteins, SRC is also active at the sites of cell-cell contact adherens junctions and phosphorylates substrates such as beta-catenin (CTNNB1), delta-catenin (CTNND1), and plakoglobin (JUP). Another type of cell-cell junction, the gap junction, is also a target for SRC, which phosphorylates connexin-43 (GJA1). SRC is implicated in regulation of pre-mRNA-processing and phosphorylates RNA-binding proteins such as KHDRBS1 (Probable). Phosphorylates PKP3 at 'Tyr-195' in response to reactive oxygen species, which may cause the release of PKP3 from desmosome cell junctions into the cytoplasm (PubMed:25501895). Also plays a role in PDGF-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of both STAT1 and STAT3, leading to increased DNA binding activity of these transcription factors (By similarity). Involved in the RAS pathway through phosphorylation of RASA1 and RASGRF1 (PubMed:11389730). Plays a role in EGF-mediated calcium-activated chloride channel activation (PubMed:18586953). Required for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) internalization through phosphorylation of clathrin heavy chain (CLTC and CLTCL1) at 'Tyr-1477'. Involved in beta-arrestin (ARRB1 and ARRB2) desensitization through phosphorylation and activation of GRK2, leading to beta-arrestin phosphorylation and internalization. Has a critical role in the stimulation of the CDK20/MAPK3 mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade by epidermal growth factor (Probable). Might be involved not only in mediating the transduction of mitogenic signals at the level of the plasma membrane but also in controlling progression through the cell cycle via interaction with regulatory proteins in the nucleus (PubMed:7853507). Plays an important role in osteoclastic bone resorption in conjunction with PTK2B/PYK2. Both the formation of a SRC-PTK2B/PYK2 complex and SRC kinase activity are necessary for this function. Recruited to activated integrins by PTK2B/PYK2, thereby phosphorylating CBL, which in turn induces the activation and recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to the cell membrane in a signaling pathway that is critical for osteoclast function (PubMed:14585963, PubMed:8755529). Promotes energy production in osteoclasts by activating mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase (PubMed:12615910). Phosphorylates DDR2 on tyrosine residues, thereby promoting its subsequent autophosphorylation (PubMed:16186108). Phosphorylates RUNX3 and COX2 on tyrosine residues, TNK2 on 'Tyr-284' and CBL on 'Tyr-731' (PubMed:20100835, PubMed:21309750). Enhances RIGI-elicited antiviral signaling (PubMed:19419966). Phosphorylates PDPK1 at 'Tyr-9', 'Tyr-373' and 'Tyr-376' (PubMed:14585963). Phosphorylates BCAR1 at 'Tyr-128' (PubMed:22710723). Phosphorylates CBLC at multiple tyrosine residues, phosphorylation at 'Tyr-341' activates CBLC E3 activity (PubMed:20525694). Phosphorylates synaptic vesicle protein synaptophysin (SYP) (By similarity). Involved in anchorage-independent cell growth (PubMed:19307596). Required for podosome formation (By similarity). Mediates IL6 signaling by activating YAP1-NOTCH pathway to induce inflammation-induced epithelial regeneration (PubMed:25731159). Phosphorylates OTUB1, promoting deubiquitination of RPTOR (PubMed:35927303). Phosphorylates caspase CASP8 at 'Tyr-380' which negatively regulates CASP8 processing and activation, down-regulating CASP8 proapoptotic function (PubMed:16619028)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nProto‐oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src (c-Src/pp60c-src) is a member of the Src family kinases (SFKs), a group of evolutionarily conserved non-receptor tyrosine kinases. In mammals, the Src family comprises nine members (e.g., Src, Fyn, Yes, Lyn, Lck, Hck, Fgr, Blk, and Yrk), which share a conserved modular organization and are found across diverse metazoans. Its evolutionary relationships have been established through comparative analyses of kinase domains and regulatory regions, which indicate that the Src module emerged in early eukaryotes and its diversification predates the divergence of vertebrates (lin2005probingtheregulatory pages 26-30, ayrapetov2006structuralandfunctional pages 21-25).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nc-Src catalyzes the transfer of a γ-phosphate group from ATP to tyrosine residues in specific substrate proteins. The generalized chemical reaction is:  \n ATP + [protein]-L-tyrosine → ADP + [protein]-L-tyrosine-phosphate + H⁺  \nThis phosphotransfer reaction modulates the activity, localization, and interactions of its substrate proteins (ayrapetov2006structuralandfunctional pages 14-18, sun2022targetingproteinproteininteractions pages 18-24).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of Src is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions. Specifically, Mg²⁺ is required as a cofactor to coordinate ATP binding and facilitate the catalytic transfer of the phosphate group (ayrapetov2006structuralandfunctional pages 14-18, lin2005probingtheregulatory pages 139-141).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nSrc exhibits substrate specificity for tyrosine residues within proteins that often contain particular recognition motifs. The catalytic domain targets the hydroxyl group of tyrosine residues, while substrate recognition is further refined by intramolecular and intermolecular interactions mediated by its SH2 and SH3 domains. Although the precise consensus motif is not as stringently defined as for some serine/threonine kinases, many substrates display regions that are phosphorylated only after receptor clustering or adapter protein recruitment. This mode of substrate selection underpins Src’s ability to modify proteins involved in adhesion, signaling, and cytoskeletal organization (ayrapetov2006structuralandfunctional pages 25-29, sun2022targetingproteinproteininteractions pages 46-49).\n\n5. Structure  \nSrc is composed of several distinct domains arranged in a modular fashion. At the N-terminus, the short SH4 domain contains sites for myristoylation and palmitoylation that target Src to the plasma membrane. This is followed by a variable unique domain that contributes to isoform-specific interactions. Adjacent is the SH3 domain, which binds proline-rich motifs, and the SH2 domain which specifically recognizes phosphotyrosine-containing sequences. The central catalytic (kinase) domain is composed of two lobes: a smaller N-terminal lobe that binds ATP through a glycine-rich loop and a larger C-terminal lobe that coordinates substrate binding; within the C-lobe, the activation loop (which contains autophosphorylation site Tyr416) is essential for full catalytic activity. A short C-terminal tail contains a critical tyrosine residue (Tyr527) that, when phosphorylated by C-terminal Src kinase (Csk), creates an intramolecular binding site for the SH2 domain; this interaction maintains Src in a closed, inactive conformation. Key features of the active structure include the proper alignment of the catalytic residues, the positioning of the C-helix, and the integrity of the hydrophobic regulatory spine (ayrapetov2006structuralandfunctional pages 25-29, lin2005probingtheregulatory pages 22-26, sun2022targetingproteinproteininteractions pages 76-79).\n\n6. Regulation  \nSrc activity is tightly controlled through multiple regulatory mechanisms. A principal mode of regulation is via phosphorylation at two key sites. Phosphorylation of the C-terminal Tyr527 by kinases such as Csk (and its homolog Chk) promotes an intramolecular interaction in which the SH2 domain binds the phosphotyrosine, thereby stabilizing Src in an inactive conformation. Conversely, autophosphorylation of Tyr416 in the activation loop shifts the equilibrium toward an open, active conformation. In addition to these phosphorylation events, the SH3 domain can bind proline-rich sequences in partner proteins, and such interactions can either facilitate or disrupt the intramolecular interactions that maintain the inactive state. These allosteric and conformational regulations ensure that Src is activated transiently in response to upstream receptor engagement, such as from immune response receptors, integrins, or receptor tyrosine kinases (ayrapetov2006structuralandfunctional pages 103-106, lin2005probingtheregulatory pages 139-141).\n\n7. Function  \nSrc plays a central role in various cellular signaling pathways. It is activated downstream of receptor engagement including that of immune receptors, integrins, G protein-coupled receptors, and growth factor receptors. Upon receptor clustering or dimerization, Src is recruited to the receptor complexes where it phosphorylates tyrosine residues in the receptor cytoplasmic domains and in associated adaptor proteins. This leads to the propagation of signals that control gene transcription, cell adhesion, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, migration, and transformation. Moreover, Src is instrumental in the regulation of cytoskeletal organization through phosphorylation of substrates such as AFAP1 and cortactin, and is involved in signal crosstalk with other protein tyrosine kinases. Its participation in pathways such as the RAS cascade and its role in focal adhesion dynamics further underscore its importance in both normal cellular function and oncogenic transformation (ayrapetov2006structuralandfunctional pages 14-18, ayrapetov2006structuralandfunctional pages 29-33, lin2005probingtheregulatory pages 75-79).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral small-molecule inhibitors targeting Src have been developed, many of which are ATP-competitive. These inhibitors have been evaluated in preclinical and clinical settings due to Src’s well-established role in oncogenesis and malignant progression. In addition, engineered control approaches – such as allosteric modulation via domain insertions or optogenetic control strategies – have been reported to allow for precise temporal and spatial regulation of Src activity. Src is implicated in a wide range of diseases including various cancers, as well as cardiovascular, immune, and neurological disorders. Its dysregulated activity often leads to aberrant signal transduction and is associated with increased cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis (lin2005probingtheregulatory pages 22-26, ayrapetov2006structuralandfunctional pages 14-18).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nYES1 is a non‐receptor protein tyrosine kinase that belongs to the Src family kinases (SFKs), an evolutionarily conserved group of enzymes present in all metazoans. Comparative analyses using human kinome data have shown that YES1 shares a high degree of sequence identity and a characteristic modular domain organization with other prominent SFK members such as Src, Fyn, and Lyn. Phylogenetic reconstructions indicate that the catalytic domain of YES1 clusters with these kinases, reflecting a common evolutionary origin from an ancestral Src family kinase that existed in early metazoans. This kinase is detected across diverse vertebrate lineages and even in invertebrates, confirming its ancient origin and the critical pressure to conserve its function throughout evolution. The evolutionary history of YES1 suggests that while subtle structural variations confer unique regulatory and substrate recognition properties, its overall domain architecture has been retained from the common ancestor of animals (Bradley2019EvolutionOfProtein pages 1-2, Garmendia2022YES1ANovel pages 1-2, Kook2024EmergingRolesOf pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nYES1 catalyzes the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on substrate proteins, a hallmark reaction of protein tyrosine kinases. The biochemical reaction involves the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of an L-tyrosine residue, resulting in the formation of ADP, a phosphorylated protein, and the release of a proton. This reaction can be formally represented as:  \n  ATP + [protein]-(L-tyrosine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-tyrosine phosphate) + H⁺.  \nThis phosphoryl transfer is central to the function of YES1 in initiating and propagating intracellular signaling cascades that are critical for regulating cellular growth, survival, adhesion, and migration (Bradley2019EvolutionOfProtein pages 25-25, Sprowl2016APhosphotyrosineSwitch pages 10-10).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of YES1, like that of most protein kinases, is strictly dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions. Specifically, Mg²⁺ ions serve as essential cofactors for YES1 activity by coordinating with the ATP molecule in the catalytic pocket. This coordination plays a vital role in properly orienting the γ-phosphate group of ATP for efficient transfer to the target tyrosine residue on the substrate. The reliance on Mg²⁺ is a conserved biochemical feature among protein kinases and is crucial for the stabilization of the substrate–ATP complex during the phosphoryl transfer reaction (Cann2017MeasuringKinaseActivity—a pages 37-44).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nYES1 exhibits substrate specificity that is characteristic of Src family kinases. Although there is no single, definitive consensus sequence exclusively associated with YES1 phosphorylation, studies on the human tyrosine kinome have demonstrated a preference for substrates that contain specific amino acid contexts favorable for tyrosine phosphorylation. Through its catalytic domain, YES1 phosphorylates key substrates in diverse cellular processes. For example, following the activation of receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGFR, YES1 phosphorylates PARD3; this phosphorylation event plays an important role in the assembly of epithelial tight junctions. In parallel, YES1 facilitates the phosphorylation of junctional proteins like CTNND1 indirectly by activating other Src family kinases such as FYN and FER at cell–cell contacts. In immune cell contexts, YES1 is involved in phosphorylating collapsin response mediator protein 2 (also designated DPYSL2) upon stimulation by chemokines like CXCL12, thereby promoting T-cell migration. YES1 also directly phosphorylates cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), a critical regulator of the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and it catalyzes phosphorylation events that enhance the functional activity of organic cation transporter OCT2. The substrate-selected motifs appear to favor local sequence contexts that are conducive to binding by the SH2 domain, which recognizes phosphotyrosine residues, and the SH3 domain, which binds to proline-rich regions; however, a specific consensus motif for YES1 remains less well established compared to some serine/threonine kinases (Sprowl2016APhosphotyrosineSwitch pages 10-10, Kook2024EmergingRolesOf pages 2-4, Zhao2020ScribbleSubcellularLocalization pages 18-23).\n\n5. Structure  \nYES1 displays the canonical structural organization observed for Src family kinases. At its extreme N-terminus, YES1 contains an SH4 domain that harbors the sequence motifs necessary for myristoylation and, in many cases, palmitoylation; these post-translational lipid modifications are critical for anchoring the protein to cellular membranes and for specifying its subcellular localization. Immediately following the SH4 domain is a unique region that is specific to YES1 and may contribute additional regulatory functions distinct from its paralogs. The protein then encompasses an SH3 domain, which is primarily responsible for binding to proline-rich motifs in interacting proteins and is also involved in intramolecular interactions that help maintain an autoinhibited state. Adjacent to the SH3 domain is an SH2 domain that functions to bind phosphotyrosine-containing sequences, thereby facilitating specific substrate recognition and the assembly of signaling complexes. The C-terminal region of YES1 contains the catalytic or kinase domain (often referred to as the SH1 domain). This catalytic domain is organized into a bilobed structure where the smaller N-terminal lobe is primarily responsible for binding ATP and the larger C-terminal lobe is involved in substrate binding. Within the kinase domain, several key structural features are present: the activation loop, which must be phosphorylated for full enzymatic activation; the C-helix, which positions critical catalytic residues; and a hydrophobic spine that is essential for stabilizing the active conformation of the enzyme. Advanced structural studies, including crystallography of related Src family members and computational modeling, support the modular and dynamic nature of YES1’s three-dimensional organization (Bludau2022TheStructuralContext pages 21-23, Kukenshoner2017SelectiveTargetingOf pages 30-35, Zhao2020ScribbleSubcellularLocalization pages 18-23).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe activity of YES1 is governed by multiple regulatory mechanisms that include post-translational modifications and protein–protein interactions. A key event in the activation of YES1 is the autophosphorylation of a tyrosine residue located within its activation loop; this autophosphorylation induces a conformational shift that opens the catalytic cleft and enhances substrate access to the active site. In contrast, phosphorylation of a conserved tyrosine residue in the C-terminal tail—typically mediated by the C-terminal Src kinase (CSK)—results in an autoinhibited conformation. In this inhibited state, the SH2 domain binds intramolecularly to the phosphorylated tail, thereby occluding the active site and preventing substrate binding. In addition to phosphorylation, YES1 is subject to ubiquitination that can influence its protein stability and subcellular redistribution. Lipid modifications in the SH4 domain, specifically myristoylation and palmitoylation, also play essential roles in regulation by targeting YES1 to membrane microdomains where receptor tyrosine kinases (such as EGFR, PDGFR, CSF1R, and FGFR) reside. These membrane-localized interactions not only facilitate YES1 activation but also ensure that its catalytic activity is spatially coordinated with its downstream substrates (Kook2024EmergingRolesOf pages 13-14, Bhullar2018KinaseTargetedCancerTherapies pages 11-13).\n\n7. Function  \nYES1 serves as a central regulator in various cellular processes as a non-receptor tyrosine kinase. It is broadly expressed in multiple tissue types, reflecting its fundamental role in both normal physiology and disease states. YES1 is primarily activated downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases. Upon activation of receptors such as EGFR, PDGFR, CSF1R, or FGFR, YES1 is recruited to the phosphorylated receptor complexes, where its kinase activity is triggered. One of the pivotal functions of YES1 is the phosphorylation of PARD3 in response to EGFR activation; such phosphorylation events facilitate the assembly of epithelial tight junctions, thereby contributing to the maintenance of cell–cell adhesion. In addition, YES1 indirectly promotes the phosphorylation of CTNND1 (catenin delta-1) through the stimulation of associated Src family members like FYN and FER at sites of cell–cell contact, further supporting the integrity of adherens junctions. YES1 also plays significant roles in immune cell function: following chemokine stimulation by CXCL12, YES1 phosphorylates collapsin response mediator protein 2 (DPYSL2), leading to enhanced T-cell migration. Beyond its involvement in adhesion and migration, YES1 phosphorylates cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) to regulate the progression of the G1 phase of the cell cycle and is implicated in G2/M progression and cytokinesis. Furthermore, YES1 phosphorylates the organic cation transporter OCT2, leading to increased transporter activity, which may have implications in drug uptake and metabolic regulation. These diverse functions underscore YES1’s role in mediating key signaling pathways that regulate cell growth, survival, adhesion, migration, and division (Bludau2022TheStructuralContext pages 21-23, Kook2024EmergingRolesOf pages 2-4, Sprowl2016APhosphotyrosineSwitch pages 10-10, Wu2023YES1MediatedCUL9Phosphorylation pages 13-14, Bhullar2018KinaseTargetedCancerTherapies pages 13-13).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nYES1 has been extensively evaluated as a potential druggable oncogene owing to its frequent overexpression and gene amplification in a variety of human cancers. Elevated YES1 expression correlates with enhanced tumor proliferation, increased metastatic potential, and resistance to conventional therapies. Broad-spectrum inhibitors, such as dasatinib, have been used experimentally to target YES1; however, these agents typically lack the specificity required to selectively inhibit YES1 without affecting other Src family kinases. Consequently, iterative compound screening approaches that incorporate advanced computational modeling and docking techniques have been employed to identify novel, more selective inhibitors of YES1. In several solid tumors—including non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, colorectal carcinoma, and gastric cancers—YES1 dysregulation has been implicated not only in tumor progression but also in acquired resistance mechanisms to therapies targeting EGFR and HER2. As a result, YES1 is both a prognostic biomarker and a promising therapeutic target in oncology. The development of selective inhibitors with improved potency and minimal off-target effects remains an active area of research, with the aim of effectively counteracting YES1-mediated drug resistance and tumor progression (Chiba2015IdentificationOfPotential pages 11-12, Kook2024EmergingRolesOf pages 13-14, Kukenshoner2017SelectiveTargetingOf pages 30-35, Bhullar2018KinaseTargetedCancerTherapies pages 11-13).\n\n9.

S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase Blk belongs to the Src family of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases and is classified in subfamily B, which is typified by a conserved domain architecture distinct from subfamily A members. BLK is evolutionarily conserved among vertebrates and is found exclusively in B lymphocytes, with orthologs traceable in mammalian species. Its grouping within the human kinome was originally defined in comprehensive studies of the protein kinase complement (Manning et al. 2002 Science, Manning et al. 2002 Trends Biochem Sci), and subsequent functional studies have underscored its close evolutionary relationships with other B cell–expressed Src family kinases such as Lyn and Fyn (korademirnics2000srckinasemediatedsignaling pages 2-3, barreiro2017functionalstudiesof pages 40-43).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nBLK catalyzes the transfer of the gamma‐phosphate group from ATP to specific tyrosine residues on its substrate proteins. In chemical notation, the general reaction is: ATP + [protein]–tyrosine → ADP + [protein]–phosphotyrosine + H⁺ (bolen1997leukocyteproteintyrosine pages 1-4, corey1999srcrelatedproteintyrosine pages 2-3).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nAs with many protein kinases, the catalytic activity of BLK depends on divalent cations, primarily Mg²⁺, which serve as essential cofactors that facilitate the binding and proper orientation of ATP for phosphoryl transfer (ingley2008srcfamilykinases pages 1-2, bolen1997leukocyteproteintyrosine pages 1-4).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nBLK has substrate specificity that targets critical immunoreceptor components. It phosphorylates CD79A at tyrosine residues 188 and 199 and CD79B at tyrosine residues 196 and 207, events central to both B-cell receptor (BCR) and pre-BCR signaling cascades (barreiro2017functionalstudiesof pages 14-23). In addition, BLK catalyzes the phosphorylation of immunoglobulin G (IgG) receptor subunits FCGR2A, FCGR2B, and FCGR2C, and it has been shown to contribute indirectly to the activation of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) through stimulation of BTK autophosphorylation (barreiro2017functionalstudiesof pages 43-47, bolen1997leukocyteproteintyrosine pages 1-4). While detailed consensus motifs have not been definitively established, the substrates of BLK typically present with tyrosine-containing immunoreceptor activation motifs (ITAMs) embedded in an acidic context, which is characteristic of its Src family kinase relatives (corey1999srcrelatedproteintyrosine pages 3-5).\n\n5. Structure  \nBLK displays the conserved modular organization characteristic of Src family kinases. It possesses an N-terminal SH4 domain that is post-translationally modified through N-myristoylation and palmitoylation to mediate efficient membrane localization in B cells (korademirnics2000srckinasemediatedsignaling pages 2-3, barreiro2017functionalstudiesof pages 40-43). Following this, a unique region is found that provides additional regulation and may confer subtle specificity among Src family members. BLK contains an SH3 domain that binds proline-rich sequences and plays a key role in autoregulation; notably, a naturally occurring variation such as the Ala71Thr substitution within the SH3 domain has been shown to increase ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation without affecting subcellular localization (barreiro2017functionalstudiesof pages 76-80, barreiro2017functionalstudiesof pages 92-98). The central kinase domain, which carries the ATP-binding site and catalytic machinery, is flanked by an SH2 domain which mediates binding to phosphotyrosine-containing motifs on substrate proteins. The C-terminal tail of BLK, while shorter than those found in some other Src kinases, contains regulatory tyrosine residues that are phosphorylated by upstream kinases such as Csk to maintain an inactive conformation (bolen1997leukocyteproteintyrosine pages 4-6, superti‐furga1995structure‐functionrelationshipsin pages 6-8).\n\n6. Regulation  \nBLK activity is subject to multiple layers of regulation that are common to Src family kinases. Post-translational modifications, notably phosphorylation at specific tyrosine residues within the activation loop (which, when phosphorylated, promote full kinase activity) and at a conserved C-terminal inhibitory tyrosine (which, when phosphorylated by Csk, stabilize an inactive conformation), are critical determinants of its functional state (barreiro2017functionalstudiesof pages 98-101, bolen1997leukocyteproteintyrosine pages 6-9). In addition, the Ala71Thr variant in the SH3 domain has been documented to enhance polyubiquitination of BLK, thereby decreasing its half-life and protein levels; this modification is mediated by E3 ubiquitin ligases such as E6AP following activation (barreiro2017functionalstudiesof pages 72-76). Such regulation via phosphorylation and ubiquitination ensures that BLK-mediated signaling is tightly controlled during B cell development and activation (korademirnics2000srckinasemediatedsignaling pages 9-10, mahajan1995srcfamilyprotein pages 6-7).\n\n7. Function  \nBLK plays a crucial role in B lymphocyte development, differentiation, and signaling. It is predominantly expressed in B cells and is essential for transmitting signals initiated by the B-cell receptor (BCR). Binding of antigen to the BCR triggers signaling pathways in which BLK phosphorylates the CD79A and CD79B components, facilitating downstream pathways that include NF-kappa-B activation and contributing to the transition from pro-B to pre-B cells (barreiro2017functionalstudiesof pages 14-23, barreiro2017functionalstudiesof pages 50-60). In addition to its classical role in B-cell signaling, BLK has been implicated in modulating beta-cell function in pancreatic islets via the up-regulation of key transcription factors PDX1 and NKX6-1, thereby influencing insulin secretion in response to glucose (Information section, PubMed:19667185). BLK also phosphorylates CGAS, promoting its retention in the cytosol, which may affect innate immune signaling pathways (Information section, PubMed:30356214). Through its interactions, including with adaptor molecules such as BANK1, BLK coordinates signaling events that determine B-cell activation thresholds and long-term cellular responses (barreiro2017functionalstudiesof pages 43-47, bolen1997leukocyteproteintyrosine pages 1-4).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral Src family kinase inhibitors that target the ATP-binding pocket or allosteric sites have been shown to inhibit kinases such as BLK. For instance, FDA-approved inhibitors including Dasatinib, Ponatinib, and Saracatinib have activity against Src family members and therefore are relevant to BLK inhibition (sumera2023pharmacophorebasedhigh pages 1-2, sumera2023pharmacophorebasedhigh pages 9-9). BLK has been genetically associated with autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis; risk-associated variants frequently result in diminished BLK expression and dysregulation of B-cell signaling (barreiro2017functionalstudiesof pages 14-23, barreiro2017functionalstudiesof pages 50-60). In addition, its expression profile and role in B cell signaling suggest potential implications in B-cell malignancies, although knockout studies have demonstrated functional redundancy among Src family kinases in B lymphocytes (bolen1997leukocyteproteintyrosine pages 1-4, korademirnics2000srckinasemediatedsignaling pages 4-5).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase HCK belongs to the Src family of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases, which are evolutionarily conserved signaling enzymes that first emerged in early metazoans. HCK is expressed primarily in hematopoietic cells and its orthologs can be found in other mammalian species, indicating a conserved function among vertebrates. Within the human kinome, HCK is grouped together with other Src family members such as c-Src, Lyn, Fgr, Fyn, Blk, Lck, and Yes. Comparative analyses that outline the protein kinase complement in humans demonstrate that Src family kinases share a common evolutionary origin that traces back to early eukaryotes, and their conservation is underscored by the high sequence homology observed in their catalytic domains (ayrapetov2006structuralandfunctional pages 14-18, lin2005probingtheregulatory pages 26-30).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nHCK catalyzes the transfer of the γ-phosphate from ATP to specific tyrosine residues on substrate proteins. The overall chemical reaction can be represented as:  \n  ATP + [protein]-tyrosine → ADP + [protein]-phosphotyrosine + H⁺.  \nThis reaction is a hallmark of protein tyrosine kinases and underpins the regulation of multiple signaling pathways by altering protein conformation and function through phosphorylation (ayrapetov2006structuralandfunctional pages 14-18, corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 13-16).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of HCK, like that of other protein kinases, is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions. In particular, Mg²⁺ ions are required to coordinate the binding of ATP within the active site and to facilitate the phosphoryl transfer reaction. This requirement for Mg²⁺ is typical for kinases that utilize ATP as a phosphate donor (ayrapetov2006structuralandfunctional pages 14-18, lin2005probingtheregulatory pages 22-26).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nHCK exhibits substrate specificity that is characteristic of Src family kinases. Its substrate recognition is determined not only by the catalytic pocket but also by its modular SH2 and SH3 domains, which interact with phosphotyrosine‐containing sequences and proline-rich regions, respectively. HCK phosphorylates a range of substrates including adaptor proteins and signaling molecules such as CBL, ADAM15, BCR, ELMO1, FCGR2A, GAB1, GAB2, RAPGEF1, STAT5B, TP73, VAV1, and WAS. The intrinsic substrate specificity of human tyrosine kinases has been delineated through peptide microarrays and motif analysis, with the substrates of HCK generally displaying a context that is recognized via docking interactions mediated by its SH2 domain following an initial phosphorylation event. Thus, the substrate motif does not rely solely on a simple linear consensus but is dictated by the spatial arrangement of amino acids that flank the phosphorylated tyrosine and by additional protein–protein interaction modules (bhanumathy2021proteintyrosinekinases pages 2-4, corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 152-155).\n\n5. Structure  \nHCK is organized into several distinct structural domains, which together mediate its localization, substrate binding, and catalytic activity. At the N-terminus, HCK contains an SH4 domain that undergoes co-translational myristoylation and, in some cases, palmitoylation; these lipid modifications are critical for anchoring the kinase to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (ayrapetov2006structuralandfunctional pages 25-29, lin2005probingtheregulatory pages 26-30). Immediately following the SH4 domain is a unique region that contributes to isoform-specific interactions. Next, HCK possesses an SH3 domain that binds proline-rich sequences, contributing to its autoinhibitory conformation through intramolecular interactions with a linker region; the SH3-mediated interactions also facilitate the assembly of signaling complexes (ayrapetov2006structuralandfunctional pages 21-25, ayrapetov2006structuralandfunctional pages 33-36). Adjacent to the SH3 domain is the SH2 domain, which recognizes phosphotyrosine motifs on target proteins or within the kinase itself. The central catalytic (kinase) domain is responsible for the phosphoryl transfer reaction; it shows the canonical bilobal structure observed in protein kinases, with a smaller N-terminal lobe that binds ATP and a larger C-terminal lobe that binds the substrate. Key structural features include the activation loop, which must be phosphorylated at an activating tyrosine residue for full catalytic activity, a hydrophobic spine that stabilizes the active conformation, and the C-helix, whose proper positioning is essential for ATP binding and catalysis (ayrapetov2006structuralandfunctional pages 39-42, lin2005probingtheregulatory pages 72-75). The C-terminal regulatory tail contains a specific tyrosine residue that, when phosphorylated by C-terminal Src kinase (Csk), participates in the intramolecular autoinhibition of HCK by binding to its own SH2 domain. This structural arrangement is crucial for maintaining the kinase in an inactive state under basal conditions and allowing prompt activation in response to extracellular signals (ayrapetov2006structuralandfunctional pages 148-150, corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 137-141).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulatory mechanisms governing HCK activity involve multiple levels of control that include post-translational modifications and intramolecular domain interactions. HCK is subject to both activating and inhibitory phosphorylation events. Autophosphorylation within the activation loop (analogous to Tyr416 in c-Src) leads to a conformational rearrangement that stimulates catalytic activity, whereas phosphorylation of the C-terminal tyrosine (comparable to Tyr527 in c-Src) by regulatory kinases such as Csk results in a closed, inactive conformation by promoting intramolecular binding between the phosphorylated tail and the SH2 domain (ayrapetov2006structuralandfunctional pages 148-150, lin2005probingtheregulatory pages 34-37). In addition, allosteric regulation occurs through the displacement of the SH3 domain by competing ligands, as evidenced by engineered variants of HCK that incorporate insertions in the kinase domain to allow external modulation. For example, experiments using an engineered variant of HCK (HckFL-Bad) demonstrated that disrupting autoinhibitory domain interactions can robustly activate the kinase, an effect that was reversible upon treatment with a selective small molecule disruptor (A-1155463) (bienick2019engineeredcontrolover pages 68-73). These regulatory modifications are crucial for ensuring that HCK activity is tightly controlled in hematopoietic cells, thereby preventing aberrant signaling that could lead to oncogenic transformation (corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 152-155, lin2005probingtheregulatory pages 139-141).\n\n7. Function  \nHCK plays a central role in the regulation of innate immune responses within hematopoietic cells. Its expression is primarily detected in neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and mast cells, where it transmits signals downstream of a variety of cell surface receptors. These receptors include Fcγ receptors (such as FCGR1A and FCGR2A), CSF3R (colony-stimulating factor 3 receptor), receptors for interferon-γ (IFNG), interleukins (IL2, IL6, IL8), and integrins (ITGB1 and ITGB2). By phosphorylating a multitude of substrates—including the E3 ubiquitin ligase CBL, the metalloprotease ADAM15, B-cell receptor (BCR) components, ELMO1, GAB1, GAB2, RAPGEF1, STAT5B, transcriptional regulator TP73, VAV1, and the Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein (WAS)—HCK orchestrates diverse cellular processes (Information section; bhanumathy2021proteintyrosinekinases pages 7-9, ubau2013functionalcharacterizationof pages 15-18). In the context of the phagocytic process, HCK mediates the mobilization of secretory lysosomes, degranulation, and the activation of NADPH oxidase, which collectively facilitate the respiratory burst critical for pathogen clearance. Additionally, HCK influences cell adhesion and migration by promoting actin cytoskeletal reorganization, including the formation of podosomes and cell protrusions. Beyond these roles, HCK negatively regulates TP73-mediated transcription and apoptosis, thereby contributing to cell survival. These diverse functions underscore the kinase’s role as an integral mediator in immune cell signaling and innate host defense (Information section; bhanumathy2021proteintyrosinekinases pages 7-9, corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 10-13).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nExperimental efforts and structural studies underscore the potential utility of HCK as a therapeutic target. Selective inhibitors and engineered modulation strategies have been designed to regulate its activity; for instance, modified forms of HCK that enable controllable kinase function have been tested in cell-based assays with small molecule disruptors (bienick2019engineeredcontrolover pages 68-73). Dysregulation of HCK activity has been implicated in leukemogenesis and other hematological malignancies, rendering it an attractive candidate for drug targeting in such diseases. Although specific HCK inhibitors are not yet as well characterized as those for some other tyrosine kinases, the design principles extrapolated from Src family kinase regulation have guided the discovery of small molecules that inhibit or modulate HCK activity. Furthermore, mutations affecting either the ATP-binding site or the regulatory domains of HCK may have profound effects on its activity, and such mutations are currently the object of ongoing research in the context of immune dysregulation and cancer. The interconnected nature of HCK with signaling networks involving upstream receptors and downstream substrates emphasizes its central position in coordinating cellular responses and highlights the continuing need to refine pharmacological strategies targeting this kinase to treat conditions such as leukemia and chronic inflammatory disorders (bhanumathy2021proteintyrosinekinases pages 7-9, corwin2016decipheringhumancytoplasmic pages 152-155).\n\n9.

Plays a key role in T-cell antigen receptor (TCR)-linked signal transduction pathways. Constitutively associated with the cytoplasmic portions of the CD4 and CD8 surface receptors. Association of the TCR with a peptide antigen-bound MHC complex facilitates the interaction of CD4 and CD8 with MHC class II and class I molecules, respectively, thereby recruiting the associated LCK protein to the vicinity of the TCR/CD3 complex. LCK then phosphorylates tyrosine residues within the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAM) of the cytoplasmic tails of the TCR-gamma chains and CD3 subunits, initiating the TCR/CD3 signaling pathway. Once stimulated, the TCR recruits the tyrosine kinase ZAP70, that becomes phosphorylated and activated by LCK. Following this, a large number of signaling molecules are recruited, ultimately leading to lymphokine production. LCK also contributes to signaling by other receptor molecules. Associates directly with the cytoplasmic tail of CD2, which leads to hyperphosphorylation and activation of LCK. Also plays a role in the IL2 receptor-linked signaling pathway that controls the T-cell proliferative response. Binding of IL2 to its receptor results in increased activity of LCK. Is expressed at all stages of thymocyte development and is required for the regulation of maturation events that are governed by both pre-TCR and mature alpha beta TCR. Phosphorylates other substrates including RUNX3, PTK2B/PYK2, the microtubule-associated protein MAPT, RHOH or TYROBP.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase Lck (gene LCK) is a member of the Src family of non‐receptor protein tyrosine kinases that are largely restricted to lymphoid cells. Lck shares conserved sequence motifs and domain architectures with its paralogs such as Src, Fyn, Lyn, and others, in which the common precursor of these kinases is traceable to early metazoan evolution as proposed in the kinase complement studies (korademirnics2000srckinasemediatedsignaling pages 2-3, kwon2019tracingtheevolution pages 15-19). Orthologs of Lck have been described from invertebrate chordates to mammals, and its identification in amphioxus (Branchiostoma belcheri) further supports the evolutionary conservation of this kinase in regulating immune‐like responses (zhou2021identificationandcharacterization pages 12-13). Lck is thus placed within the Src module subgroup of the tyrosine kinome, with its phylogenetic relationships defined by its characteristic SH3 and SH2 domains followed by a catalytic kinase domain (kwon2019tracingtheevolution pages 28-32, korademirnics2000srckinasemediatedsignaling pages 9-10).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nLck catalyzes the transfer of a γ‐phosphate from ATP to tyrosine residues on substrate proteins. The enzymatic reaction can be summarized as:  \n  ATP + [protein]–tyrosine → ADP + [protein]–phosphotyrosine + H⁺  \nThis reaction is characteristic of tyrosine kinases and underlies the mechanism by which Lck initiates phosphorylation cascades following T‑cell receptor (TCR) engagement (chylek2014phosphorylationsitedynamics pages 14-15).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of Lck, similar to most protein kinases, requires divalent cations as cofactors. In particular, magnesium ions (Mg²⁺) are essential to coordinate ATP in the kinase active site and facilitate the phosphoryl transfer reaction (chylek2014phosphorylationsitedynamics pages 14-15, loris2007exploringstructureand pages 43-46).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nLck displays substrate specificity for tyrosine residues, phosphorylating immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) located on the cytoplasmic tails of CD3 subunits and TCR‐associated proteins. Its intrinsic substrate recognition is defined by the modular context provided by its SH2 and SH3 domains, which aid in docking to phosphorylated partners and proline‐rich motifs, respectively. For example, during TCR activation, Lck selectively phosphorylates tyrosine residues within ITAMs that have a conserved motif arrangement, thereby creating binding sites for downstream effectors such as the ZAP-70 tyrosine kinase (samraj2005rolefortyrosine pages 33-36, chylek2014phosphorylationsitedynamics pages 15-16). This substrate specificity, while influenced by direct recognition of the target sequence, is also dictated by the recruitment of Lck to plasma membrane microdomains via its interactions with CD4, CD8 and other receptor-associated proteins (korademirnics2000srckinasemediatedsignaling pages 4-5).\n\n5. Structure  \nLck exhibits the canonical domain organization typical of Src family kinases. At its N-terminus, a unique domain undergoes myristoylation which is critical for its membrane association; frequently, palmitoylation further strengthens its localization to lipid rafts. Following the unique domain, Lck contains an SH3 domain that binds proline-rich sequences, and an SH2 domain that binds phosphotyrosine-containing motifs, thereby enabling precise substrate targeting and regulation. The central catalytic kinase (SH1) domain is responsible for the phosphoryl transfer reaction. A short C-terminal tail harbors a regulatory tyrosine (Y505) whose phosphorylation by C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) enforces an intramolecular interaction with the SH2 domain, stabilizing an autoinhibited conformation. In contrast, phosphorylation of Y394 within the activation loop facilitates full activation of the kinase (majeti2000negativeregulationof pages 19-25, posevitz2007functionalelucidationof pages 34-37). High-resolution structural studies and homology models reveal that the assembly of a hydrophobic regulatory spine and positioning of the C-helix in the kinase domain are critical for the switch between inactive and active states (kwon2019tracingtheevolution pages 28-32, loris2007exploringstructureand pages 49-52).\n\n6. Regulation  \nLck activity is tightly regulated by reversible phosphorylation events. Autophosphorylation at Y394 in the activation loop leads to kinase activation, whereas phosphorylation at Y505 creates an intramolecular association with its SH2 domain that results in an inactive conformation (majeti2000negativeregulationof pages 19-25, samraj2005rolefortyrosine pages 93-96). Regulation is further modulated by opposing enzymes: the kinase Csk phosphorylates Y505 which suppresses Lck activity, while the receptor-like phosphatase CD45 dephosphorylates Y505, thereby maintaining Lck in a “primed” state ready for activation upon TCR stimulation (majeti2000negativeregulationof pages 245-251, okada2012regulationofthe pages 1-3). Additional regulatory layers include reversible lipid modifications such as myristoylation and palmitoylation, which ensure proper plasma membrane localization and targeting to specialized microdomains (posevitz2007functionalelucidationof pages 43-46, korademirnics2000srckinasemediatedsignaling pages 1-2). The dynamic interplay among these post-translational modifications orchestrates the balance between Lck’s active and inactive forms, thereby controlling the threshold for T-cell activation (samraj2005rolefortyrosine pages 8-13, korademirnics2000srckinasemediatedsignaling pages 5-6).\n\n7. Function  \nLck plays a central role in T-cell development and activation. It is expressed at all stages of thymocyte maturation and is essential for T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling. Upon engagement of the TCR by a peptide antigen bound to MHC molecules, Lck associated with the cytoplasmic tails of CD4 and CD8 is recruited to the TCR complex. In this localized environment, Lck phosphorylates ITAMs on CD3 and ζ-chain subunits initiating a signaling cascade that recruits and activates ZAP-70. This cascade culminates in the activation of multiple downstream effectors, ultimately leading to lymphokine production and full T-cell activation (chylek2014phosphorylationsitedynamics pages 14-15, samraj2005rolefortyrosine pages 1-8). In addition to its role in TCR signaling, Lck is involved in signaling pathways of other receptors, such as CD2 and the IL2 receptor, contributing to the regulation of T-cell proliferation (chylek2014phosphorylationsitedynamics pages 12-13, posevitz2007functionalelucidationof pages 34-37). Lck also phosphorylates a variety of substrates including transcription factors and signaling proteins like RUNX3, PTK2B/PYK2, MAPT, RHOH, and TYROBP, linking it to broader functions in cell adhesion, migration, and apoptosis (samraj2005rolefortyrosine pages 36-41, majeti2000negativeregulationof pages 245-251).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nAberrant regulation of Lck has been associated with immune dysfunction and oncogenic transformation. Overactivation of Lck due to impaired phosphorylation control has been implicated in T-cell leukemias and thymic tumors, while its absence or misregulation contributes to defective T-cell development, resulting in immunodeficiency disorders (samraj2005rolefortyrosine pages 93-96, majeti2000negativeregulationof pages 245-251). Several experimental inhibitors targeting Src family kinases are in various stages of investigation for their therapeutic potential in modulating immune responses and treating malignancies; however, their specificity for Lck requires careful evaluation (posevitz2007functionalelucidationof pages 95-97, okada2012regulationofthe pages 11-12). Additionally, the evolutionary conservation of Lck, as documented in non-mammalian species like amphioxus, underscores its fundamental role in immune signaling, making Lck a target of interest in both basic and clinical immunology research (zhou2021identificationandcharacterization pages 12-13, kwon2019tracingtheevolution pages 65-69).\n\n9.

Functions primarily as negative regulator, but can also function as activator, depending on the context. Required for the initiation of the B-cell response, but also for its down-regulation and termination. Plays an important role in the regulation of B-cell differentiation, proliferation, survival and apoptosis, and is important for immune self-tolerance. Acts downstream of several immune receptors, including the B-cell receptor, CD79A, CD79B, CD5, CD19, CD22, FCER1, FCGR2, FCGR1A, TLR2 and TLR4. Plays a role in the inflammatory response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Mediates the responses to cytokines and growth factors in hematopoietic progenitors, platelets, erythrocytes, and in mature myeloid cells, such as dendritic cells, neutrophils and eosinophils. Acts downstream of EPOR, KIT, MPL, the chemokine receptor CXCR4, as well as the receptors for IL3, IL5 and CSF2. Plays an important role in integrin signaling. Regulates cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, migration, adhesion, degranulation, and cytokine release. Involved in the regulation of endothelial activation, neutrophil adhesion and transendothelial migration (PubMed:36932076). Down-regulates signaling pathways by phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIM), that then serve as binding sites for phosphatases, such as PTPN6/SHP-1, PTPN11/SHP-2 and INPP5D/SHIP-1, that modulate signaling by dephosphorylation of kinases and their substrates.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase Lyn, also known by alternative names such as Lck/Yes‐related novel protein tyrosine kinase, p53Lyn, and p56Lyn, is a member of the Src family kinases (SFKs). The Src family constitutes a group of non‐receptor tyrosine kinases that are evolutionarily conserved across metazoans. Comprehensive analyses of the human protein kinase complement have demonstrated that SFKs, including Lyn, can be traced back to the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA), reflecting an ancient origin that predates the emergence of complex multicellular organisms (hanks1995theeukaryoticprotein pages 19-20). Evolutionary studies have revealed that Lyn clusters phylogenetically with other well‐characterized SFKs such as Src, Fyn, Yes, and Lck. These kinases share a highly conserved modular domain architecture – consisting of regulatory and catalytic elements – and a significant degree of amino acid sequence homology within their catalytic cores. This conservation extends particularly to the key regulatory features such as the C-terminal inhibitory tyrosine and the activation loop tyrosine, both of which are under strong evolutionary pressure to maintain precise regulatory mechanisms (hanks1995theeukaryoticprotein pages 21-21, ingley2008srcfamilykinases pages 1-2). Such phylogenetic analyses, based on genomic and proteomic studies, firmly place Lyn in the evolutionary core of tyrosine kinases. This core has been maintained throughout vertebrate evolution and is central to the regulation of signal transduction pathways that control cellular processes ranging from proliferation to immune responses (berndt2019crystalstructureof pages 6-7, ia2010structuralelementsand pages 1-6).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nLyn functions as a classical protein tyrosine kinase by catalyzing the transfer of the γ-phosphate from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to specific tyrosine residues found on target protein substrates. The chemical reaction that Lyn catalyzes can be formally represented as follows:  \n  ATP + protein-(L-tyrosine) = ADP + protein-(L-tyrosine-phosphate) + H⁺.  \nThis fundamental reaction is central to cellular signaling, as the phosphorylation event generates a phosphotyrosine residue that can serve as a docking site for downstream signaling molecules, thereby initiating or modulating complex intracellular signaling cascades (hanks1995theeukaryoticprotein pages 19-20, berndt2019crystalstructureof pages 4-6).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of Lyn, similar to that observed in most protein kinases, requires the presence of divalent cations. In particular, Mg²⁺ ions are essential for kinase function, as they coordinate the binding of ATP within the kinase domain. The divalent cation participates in stabilizing the negative charges on the phosphate groups of ATP, effectively lowering the activation energy required for the phosphotransfer reaction and facilitating the enzymatic process (blouin2011catalyticspecificityof pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nLyn exhibits substrate specificity patterns characteristic of Src family kinases. Its kinase activity is directed toward tyrosine residues that reside within specific amino acid sequence contexts conducive to binding in the catalytic cleft. For example, Lyn targets substrates involved in immunoreceptor signaling pathways. In B cells, Lyn phosphorylates components of the B-cell receptor (BCR) complex such as CD79A and CD79B, as well as regulatory proteins including CD5, CD19, and CD22. Additionally, downstream signaling proteins, for instance BTK, SYK, and CBL, are recognized substrates for Lyn. High-throughput peptide substrate profiling and in vitro kinase assays have indicated that even though a single strict consensus sequence for Lyn has not been conclusively defined, substrates typically display surrounding residues with a combination of basic and hydrophobic characteristics that favor efficient engagement with Lyn’s catalytic domain (alobeidi1998proteintyrosinekinases pages 10-12, cowanjacob2006structuralbiologyof pages 2-4, jin2015tyrosinephosphorylationof pages 22-25, alobeidi1998proteintyrosinekinases pages 12-14). This substrate specificity underlies Lyn’s ability to regulate a diverse array of signaling cascades that control immune responses, survival, and cell adhesion.\n\n5. Structure  \nThe three-dimensional structure of Lyn conforms to the canonical organization of Src family kinases, a design that supports both its catalytic function and its intricate regulatory mechanisms. At the extreme N-terminus, Lyn contains an SH4 domain, which is subject to N-myristoylation—a lipid modification that is critical for membrane association and proper subcellular targeting. Following the SH4 domain is a unique domain; although this region shows less sequence conservation among SFKs, it contributes to isoform-specific variations in regulation and may mediate particular protein–protein interactions. Lyn then possesses an SH3 domain, which recognizes and binds proline-rich motifs present in interacting proteins, and an SH2 domain that selectively binds phosphotyrosine-containing sequences, thereby enabling Lyn to both propagate and regulate signal transduction via intermolecular and intramolecular interactions (berndt2019crystalstructureof pages 2-4, ingley2008srcfamilykinases pages 1-2).  \n\nCentral to Lyn's function is the catalytic kinase domain (also known as the SH1 domain). This domain exhibits a bilobal structure, with a relatively small N-terminal lobe composed primarily of β-sheets and an αC helix, and a larger C-terminal lobe that is rich in α-helical elements. Critical features within this domain include the ATP-binding pocket, the highly conserved DFG motif (which marks the beginning of the activation loop), and key catalytic residues that directly participate in the phosphotransfer reaction. Upon phosphorylation of the activation loop tyrosine, a conformational rearrangement occurs that stabilizes the active state of Lyn; this rearrangement involves reorientation of the hydrophobic spine and the C-helix, which are essential for maintaining catalytic competency (cowanjacob2006structuralbiologyof pages 2-4, miyano2009structuralbasisfor pages 1-2). Recent crystallographic studies and high-resolution structures, including those focusing on the isolated SH3 domain, have further illuminated the atomic details underlying the regulation of Lyn’s catalytic activity and the conformational changes that occur upon activation (berndt2019crystalstructureof pages 4-6). These studies underscore the importance of the interdomain contacts among the SH4, SH3, SH2, and kinase domains in stabilizing either the inactive autoinhibited conformation or the active conformation of Lyn, depending on the cellular context.\n\n6. Regulation  \nLyn is regulated by a multifaceted network of post-translational modifications, domain interactions, and lipid-mediated signals that together fine-tune its kinase activity. A principal regulatory mechanism involves phosphorylation events. Lyn is capable of autophosphorylation on a critical tyrosine residue located within its activation loop; this autophosphorylation event promotes a conformational shift toward an active state, thereby enhancing catalytic activity (donelladeana1998spontaneousautophosphorylationof pages 1-2). In contrast, phosphorylation of a conserved tyrosine residue in the C-terminal tail—typically mediated by the C-terminal Src kinase (CSK)—generates an autoinhibitory interaction through intramolecular engagement with the SH2 domain, resulting in suppression of kinase activity (donelladeana1998spontaneousautophosphorylationof pages 7-8, ingley2012functionsofthe pages 7-8).  \n\nBeyond these primary phosphorylation switches, additional regulatory layers contribute to Lyn’s control. Its SH3 and SH2 domains not only mediate interactions with target proteins but also participate in intramolecular contacts that stabilize the inactive conformation. These domains can bind to specific proline-rich or phosphotyrosine motifs, respectively, which either maintain the autoinhibited state or facilitate release upon appropriate stimulus. Moreover, Lyn undergoes lipid modifications – notably N-myristoylation – which is essential for membrane targeting and proper localization within distinct cellular compartments such as the plasma membrane or the Golgi apparatus. Recent studies have further identified that Lyn is subject to N-myristoylation-dependent phosphorylation at serine residues. For instance, phosphorylation at Ser-13 by casein kinase 1γ (CK1γ) has been documented to occur in a Golgi-dependent manner during intracellular trafficking; such modifications add an additional level of spatial and temporal regulation to Lyn’s activity (kinoshitakikuta2020proteinnmyristoylationdependentphosphorylationof pages 1-2, kinoshitakikuta2020proteinnmyristoylationdependentphosphorylationof pages 10-12). These regulatory events collectively ensure that Lyn activity is precisely controlled in response to extracellular signals and intracellular feedback, enabling it to switch between active and inactive states as required by the physiological context.\n\n7. Function  \nLyn functions as a central signaling mediator within many hematopoietic and immune cell types. In B cells, Lyn plays an indispensable dual role in both the initiation and the subsequent attenuation of B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling. Upon antigen engagement, Lyn phosphorylates key components of the BCR complex – such as CD79A and CD79B – as well as regulatory proteins including CD5, CD19, and CD22, thereby initiating downstream signaling pathways that govern B-cell differentiation, proliferation, survival, and apoptosis. This bimodal function is critical for maintaining immune self-tolerance and preventing aberrant immune responses (alobeidi1998proteintyrosinekinases pages 10-12, cowanjacob2006structuralbiologyof pages 2-4).\n\nIn addition to its role in B-cell signaling, Lyn participates in the modulation of a broad range of receptor-mediated pathways. It acts downstream of Fc receptors and Toll-like receptors (such as TLR2 and TLR4), thus contributing to the regulation of innate immune responses and the inflammatory reaction to bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Lyn also functions in hematopoietic progenitors and in mature myeloid cells—including dendritic cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils—where it transduces signals from cytokine and growth factor receptors (including EPOR, KIT, MPL, and the chemokine receptor CXCR4) to control processes such as cell proliferation, survival, migration, and degranulation (alobeidi1998proteintyrosinekinases pages 12-14, invergo2020predictionofsigned pages 1-3).\n\nDownstream of these receptor events, Lyn regulates major intracellular signaling pathways, including the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT axis, the MAP kinase cascades (encompassing MEK1, ERK1/ERK2, and the JNK pathways), and the STAT5-mediated transcriptional pathway. Furthermore, in its role as a negative regulator, Lyn phosphorylates immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) on target proteins, thereby promoting the recruitment of inhibitory phosphatases such as SHP-1 (PTPN6), SHP-2 (PTPN11), and SHIP-1 (INPP5D). Through these actions, Lyn attenuates signaling and serves as a critical checkpoint in the regulation of immune responses, ensuring balanced and controlled cellular activation (donelladeana1998spontaneousautophosphorylationof pages 7-8, jin2015tyrosinephosphorylationof pages 22-25, ingley2012functionsofthe pages 1-2). Collectively, these diverse functions underscore Lyn’s role as a pivotal node in the signaling networks that control cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and apoptosis in various immune and hematopoietic lineages.\n\n8. Other Comments  \nLyn kinase has garnered significant attention both as a regulator of normal immune cell function and as a potential therapeutic target in pathological conditions. Several small-molecule inhibitors originally developed to target Src family kinases have been shown to inhibit Lyn activity; among these, agents such as dasatinib and bosutinib—as described in recent pharmacological evaluations—are currently used in clinical settings to treat hematological malignancies and certain solid tumors where dysregulated SFK activity has been implicated (kim2019applicationofa pages 17-18). Moreover, aberrant Lyn signaling has been associated with a spectrum of disease states including various forms of leukemia, lymphoma, and autoimmune disorders. In some instances, mutations or alterations in Lyn’s autoinhibitory interactions, particularly those involving the SH2 and SH3 domains, result in chronic kinase activation and have been linked to oncogenic transformation (donelladeana1998spontaneousautophosphorylationof pages 3-4, miyano2009structuralbasisfor pages 1-2). Additionally, the discovery of regulatory mechanisms such as the N-myristoylation-dependent phosphorylation at Ser-13 by CK1γ at the Golgi highlights novel facets of Lyn’s spatial regulation that may offer new avenues for targeted therapeutic intervention (kinoshitakikuta2020proteinnmyristoylationdependentphosphorylationof pages 10-12). These multifactorial regulatory processes not only demonstrate the biological complexity of Lyn but also emphasize the need for continued research into selective inhibitors that can modulate its activity with higher specificity.\n\n9.

Coordinates actin remodeling through tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins controlling cytoskeleton dynamics like WASF3 (involved in branch formation); ANXA1 (involved in membrane anchoring); DBN1, DBNL, CTTN, RAPH1 and ENAH (involved in signaling); or MAPT and PXN (microtubule-binding proteins). Phosphorylation of WASF3 is critical for the stimulation of lamellipodia formation and cell migration. Involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and motility through phosphorylation of key regulators of these processes such as BCAR1, CRK, CRKL, DOK1, EFS or NEDD9 (PubMed:22810897). Phosphorylates multiple receptor tyrosine kinases and more particularly promotes endocytosis of EGFR, facilitates the formation of neuromuscular synapses through MUSK, inhibits PDGFRB-mediated chemotaxis and modulates the endocytosis of activated B-cell receptor complexes. Other substrates which are involved in endocytosis regulation are the caveolin (CAV1) and RIN1. Moreover, ABL1 regulates the CBL family of ubiquitin ligases that drive receptor down-regulation and actin remodeling. Phosphorylation of CBL leads to increased EGFR stability. Involved in late-stage autophagy by regulating positively the trafficking and function of lysosomal components. ABL1 targets to mitochondria in response to oxidative stress and thereby mediates mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. In response to oxidative stress, phosphorylates serine/threonine kinase PRKD2 at 'Tyr-717' (PubMed:28428613). ABL1 is also translocated in the nucleus where it has DNA-binding activity and is involved in DNA-damage response and apoptosis. Many substrates are known mediators of DNA repair: DDB1, DDB2, ERCC3, ERCC6, RAD9A, RAD51, RAD52 or WRN. Activates the proapoptotic pathway when the DNA damage is too severe to be repaired. Phosphorylates TP73, a primary regulator for this type of damage-induced apoptosis. Phosphorylates the caspase CASP9 on 'Tyr-153' and regulates its processing in the apoptotic response to DNA damage. Phosphorylates PSMA7 that leads to an inhibition of proteasomal activity and cell cycle transition blocks. ABL1 also acts as a regulator of multiple pathological signaling cascades during infection. Several known tyrosine-phosphorylated microbial proteins have been identified as ABL1 substrates. This is the case of A36R of Vaccinia virus, Tir (translocated intimin receptor) of pathogenic E.coli and possibly Citrobacter, CagA (cytotoxin-associated gene A) of H.pylori, or AnkA (ankyrin repeat-containing protein A) of A.phagocytophilum. Pathogens can highjack ABL1 kinase signaling to reorganize the host actin cytoskeleton for multiple purposes, like facilitating intracellular movement and host cell exit. Finally, functions as its own regulator through autocatalytic activity as well as through phosphorylation of its inhibitor, ABI1. Regulates T-cell differentiation in a TBX21-dependent manner (By similarity). Positively regulates chemokine-mediated T-cell migration, polarization, and homing to lymph nodes and immune-challenged tissues, potentially via activation of NEDD9/HEF1 and RAP1 (By similarity). Phosphorylates TBX21 on tyrosine residues leading to an enhancement of its transcriptional activator activity (By similarity)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase ABL1 (commonly referred to as c‐Abl) is a non‐receptor tyrosine kinase that belongs to the Abl family of kinases. In mammals, the Abl family comprises two members – ABL1 (c‐Abl) and ABL2 (Arg) – both of which are ubiquitously expressed, with ABL1 having numerous alternatively spliced isoforms that modulate its subcellular localization and functional roles (hantschel2012structureregulationsignaling pages 1-2). Evolutionarily, the Abl kinases are conserved across metazoans; for instance, Drosophila possesses a single Abl ortholog, which has been extensively used as a simplified experimental model to delineate the in vivo functions and regulatory mechanisms shared by vertebrate ABL kinases (rogers2020abelsonkinase’sintrinsically pages 4-7, superti‐furga1995structure‐functionrelationshipsin pages 8-9). Phylogenetic studies place ABL1 within the tyrosine kinase group along with other members of the Src-related kinase families, reflecting an evolutionary lineage emerging early in the eukaryotic ancestor (superti‐furga1995structure‐functionrelationshipsin pages 9-10).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nThe catalytic activity of ABL1 involves the transfer of the γ-phosphate from ATP to specific tyrosine residues on substrate proteins. In chemical terms, the reaction can be summarized as:  \nATP + protein-(L-tyrosine) → ADP + protein-(L-tyrosine)-phosphate + H⁺  \nThis phosphorylation event is central to the regulation of substrate activity and the propagation of intracellular signaling events, thereby modulating processes such as cytoskeletal remodeling, receptor endocytosis, and DNA damage response (roskoski2003sti571ananticancer pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase catalytic mechanism of ABL1 requires the presence of divalent metal ions. In particular, Mg²⁺ serves as an essential cofactor that coordinates ATP within the catalytic cleft and stabilizes the negative charges on the phosphate groups during the phosphoryl transfer reaction (roskoski2003sti571ananticancer pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nABL1 specifically catalyzes the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on its target proteins. The substrate specificity is dictated in part by the tyrosine kinase catalytic domain, but it is further refined by substrate recruitment mediated by the SH2 and SH3 domains, which bind phosphotyrosine-containing sequences and proline-rich motifs, respectively. In practice, ABL1 phosphorylates a variety of substrates involved in actin cytoskeleton regulation, receptor endocytosis and DNA damage response. Examples include proteins such as WASF3, whose tyrosine phosphorylation is critical for the formation of lamellipodia that promote cell migration, and substrates such as CBL, where phosphorylation modulates receptor down-regulation (hantschel2012structureregulationsignaling pages 3-4, roskoski2003sti571ananticancer pages 4-5). Although the precise consensus sequence for ABL1 has not been as explicitly defined in the primary literature provided, its substrate motif is characterized by interactions with its regulatory SH2 domain that facilitates multisite phosphorylation, thus contributing to signal specificity (tse2015moleculardeterminantsunderlying pages 2-3).\n\n5. Structure  \nABL1 possesses a modular domain architecture that is fundamental to its regulation and function. Starting from the N-terminus, ABL1 in one of its prevalent isoforms (e.g., ABL1 1b) features an N-terminal myristoylation signal that promotes membrane association under some conditions but more importantly plays a key role in autoinhibition by docking into a hydrophobic pocket of the kinase C-lobe (hantschel2012structureregulationsignaling pages 1-2, roskoski2003sti571ananticancer pages 5-6). This is followed by a cap region, after which lie the SH3 and SH2 domains. The SH3 domain binds polyproline type II helices while the SH2 domain recognizes phosphotyrosine-containing peptides. These domains are arranged in such a way that they engage in intramolecular interactions; for example, the SH3 domain binds to the SH2-kinase linker, thereby reinforcing the autoinhibited conformation (hantschel2012structureregulationsignaling pages 1-2, superti‐furga1995structure‐functionrelationshipsin pages 9-10).  \nFollowing the regulatory SH2/SH3 unit is the kinase or catalytic domain (SH1 domain). This domain is organized in the classical bilobed structure observed in protein kinases, with an N-terminal lobe rich in β-sheets—responsible for ATP binding—and a larger C-terminal lobe that contains predominantly α-helices and contributes to substrate binding. Within the kinase domain, the activation loop—a critical regulatory segment containing Tyr412—is subject to autophosphorylation, providing a switch between inactive and active conformations (hantschel2012structureregulationsignaling pages 3-4, roskoski2003sti571ananticancer pages 4-5). The kinase domain also contains conserved structural motifs, including the hydrophobic spine and the C-helix, whose proper assembly is required for catalytic activity (kornev2015dynamicsdrivenallosteryin pages 6-7).  \nIn addition, ABL1 contains an extended C-terminal region that is intrinsically disordered and enriched in proline-rich motifs. This region mediates multiple protein-protein interactions that regulate the kinase function and contribute to substrate specificity (rogers2020abelsonkinase’sintrinsically pages 1-4). The disordered region contributes to the dynamic nature of ABL1, impacting its protein stability and subcellular localization (rogers2021abelsonkinase’sintrinsically pages 1-2).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe activity of ABL1 is tightly controlled by several layers of regulation. One major regulatory mechanism is autoinhibition, which is governed by intramolecular interactions involving the myristoyl group bound within a hydrophobic pocket of the kinase domain and the SH3 domain’s interaction with the SH2-kinase linker. This “latching” mechanism stabilizes an inactive conformation and prevents substrate access (hantschel2012structureregulationsignaling pages 1-2, wong2004thebcrablstory pages 10-12).  \nPhosphorylation plays a crucial role in ABL1 regulation. Autophosphorylation events, particularly at Tyr412 within the activation loop, serve as a molecular switch that shifts the enzyme from its inactive to active conformation. Phosphorylation at Tyr245 in the SH2-kinase linker also disrupts the inhibitory interactions maintained by the SH3 domain, thus promoting full kinase activation (hantschel2012structureregulationsignaling pages 3-4, roskoski2003sti571ananticancer pages 5-6).  \nIn addition to autophosphorylation, ABL1 is subject to other post-translational modifications. For instance, ubiquitination mediated by the CBL family of ubiquitin ligases can target ABL1 for proteasomal degradation, modulating its cellular abundance, especially in response to stress conditions (information section; rogers2021abelsonkinase’sintrinsically pages 26-26).  \nConformational dynamics further contribute to ABL1 regulation. The equilibrium between the inactive, autoinhibited state and the active, phosphorylated state is influenced by allosteric inhibitor binding. Inhibitors such as imatinib preferentially bind to the inactive DFG-out conformation of ABL1, thereby stabilizing the autoinhibited state, while other inhibitors such as dasatinib bind the active conformation (roskoski2003sti571ananticancer pages 8-9, tse2015moleculardeterminantsunderlying pages 35-36).  \nFinally, ABL1 shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus due to the presence of nuclear localization and export signals. In the nucleus, ABL1 participates in DNA damage responses and apoptosis, whereas in the cytoplasm it regulates cytoskeletal reorganization, cell adhesion and receptor endocytosis (hantschel2012structureregulationsignaling pages 8-9, rogers2021abelsonkinase’sintrinsically pages 1-2).\n\n7. Function  \nABL1 plays a pivotal role in many cellular processes related to growth, survival, and homeostasis. Its kinase activity is central to the dynamic regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. For example, ABL1 phosphorylates key regulators of cytoskeletal dynamics such as WASF3, thereby stimulating the formation of lamellipodia that lead to enhanced cell migration (information section; hantschel2012structureregulationsignaling pages 7-8). In addition, ABL1 phosphorylates adaptor proteins like CRK and CRKL that are involved in the modulation of cell adhesion and motility.  \nABL1 also regulates receptor-mediated endocytosis. It phosphorylates receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGFR and modulates the activity of endocytic regulators including CBL and RIN1, thereby influencing receptor internalization and signaling turnover (lund2013biotechapplicationsof pages 45-48, hantschel2012structureregulationsignaling pages 5-6).  \nIn the context of autophagy, ABL1 is involved in the regulation of lysosomal trafficking and function during the late stages of autophagy, contributing positively to the degradation process (information section).  \nIn response to cellular stress, particularly oxidative stress, ABL1 translocates to mitochondria where it phosphorylates targets such as the serine/threonine kinase PRKD2; this event contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction and can trigger cell death (information section, rogens2021abelsonkinase’sintrinsically pages 26-26).  \nFurthermore, in the nucleus ABL1 is involved in the DNA damage response. Through its DNA-binding activity and interaction with mediators of DNA repair—including proteins such as DDB1, DDB2, RAD51 and TP73—ABL1 plays a dual role in attempting repair and, if the damage is irreparable, in activating apoptotic pathways (hantschel2012structureregulationsignaling pages 3-4, roskoski2003sti571ananticancer pages 9-9).  \nABL1 is also exploited by pathogens during infection. Several microbial proteins, including A36R from Vaccinia virus and CagA from Helicobacter pylori, are phosphorylated by ABL1, facilitating the rearrangement of the host actin cytoskeleton to promote processes such as intracellular movement and host cell exit (information section).  \nCollectively, ABL1 functions as a versatile signaling hub that integrates signals from diverse cellular stimuli to regulate cytoskeletal remodeling, receptor dynamics, autophagy, DNA repair and apoptotic decisions while also impacting T-cell differentiation and chemokine-mediated migration through phosphorylation of transcription factors and adaptor proteins (information section; rogers2020abelsonkinase’sintrinsically pages 1-4).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nNumerous small-molecule inhibitors have been developed against ABL1 due to its prominent role in oncogenic transformation, particularly in the context of the BCR-ABL fusion protein observed in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Imatinib mesylate, a pioneering ATP-competitive inhibitor, binds specifically to the inactive conformation of ABL1 and has significantly improved clinical outcomes for CML patients (roskoski2003sti571ananticancer pages 1-2, wong2004thebcrablstory pages 10-12). Second-generation inhibitors such as dasatinib, nilotinib, and ponatinib possess different binding profiles and are used in cases where resistance mutations (for example, the T315I mutation) have rendered imatinib less effective (hantschel2012structureregulationsignaling pages 7-8, roskoski2003sti571ananticancer pages 8-9).  \nABL1 is implicated in various pathological signaling cascades beyond leukemia. Dysregulated ABL1 activity has been documented in neural development disorders, immune dysfunction, and may contribute to processes exploited by infectious agents to modulate host cell architecture (information section; wong2004thebcrablstory pages 47-49).  \nNotable mutations, particularly those generating the BCR-ABL fusion, alter the regulatory domains such that the autoinhibitory mechanisms are lost, resulting in constitutive kinase activity that underpins leukemogenesis. Additionally, mutations in the kinase domain may affect drug binding, leading to therapeutic resistance (roskoski2003sti571ananticancer pages 8-9, wong2004thebcrablstory pages 38-41).  \nThe extensive study of ABL1 regulation and structure has helped establish paradigms for kinase inhibitor design, including the concept of allosteric inhibition targeting the myristate binding pocket. These efforts continue to yield new agents that overcome resistance and offer increased specificity (tse2015moleculardeterminantsunderlying pages 35-36).\n\n9. References  \n1. Hantschel O.

Coordinates actin remodeling through tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins controlling cytoskeleton dynamics like MYH10 (involved in movement); CTTN (involved in signaling); or TUBA1 and TUBB (microtubule subunits). Binds directly F-actin and regulates actin cytoskeletal structure through its F-actin-bundling activity. Involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and motility through phosphorylation of key regulators of these processes such as CRK, CRKL, DOK1 or ARHGAP35. Adhesion-dependent phosphorylation of ARHGAP35 promotes its association with RASA1, resulting in recruitment of ARHGAP35 to the cell periphery where it inhibits RHO. Phosphorylates multiple receptor tyrosine kinases like PDGFRB and other substrates which are involved in endocytosis regulation such as RIN1. In brain, may regulate neurotransmission by phosphorylating proteins at the synapse. ABL2 also acts as a regulator of multiple pathological signaling cascades during infection. Pathogens can highjack ABL2 kinase signaling to reorganize the host actin cytoskeleton for multiple purposes, like facilitating intracellular movement and host cell exit. Finally, functions as its own regulator through autocatalytic activity as well as through phosphorylation of its inhibitor, ABI1. Positively regulates chemokine-mediated T-cell migration, polarization, and homing to lymph nodes and immune-challenged tissues, potentially via activation of NEDD9/HEF1 and RAP1 (By similarity)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‐protein kinase ABL2 (also known as ARG) belongs to the Abelson (ABL) family of non–receptor protein tyrosine kinases that also includes ABL1 (c‐Abl) and shares a conserved SRC homology (SH3–SH2–kinase) cassette in its N‐terminal region. This kinase family can be traced back to an ancestral Abl gene present in early metazoans, and the gene duplication that gave rise to ABL1 and ABL2 occurred early in vertebrate evolution, with ABL2 retaining a high degree of homology in its catalytic and regulatory domains compared to ABL1 while diverging considerably in its C‐terminal extension (hayes2013abelsonkinasebased pages 34-38, superti‐furga1995structure‐functionrelationshipsin pages 8-9). Orthologs of ABL2 have been identified in a wide range of vertebrate species, indicating its conserved role in essential cellular signaling and cytoskeletal regulation (mayro2022thecharacterizationof pages 17-24, kwon2019tracingtheevolution pages 65-69).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nABL2 catalyzes the transfer of the γ‐phosphate from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to specific tyrosine residues on target proteins. The reaction can be summarized as follows: ATP + [protein]–tyrosine → ADP + [protein]–phosphotyrosine + H⁺, thereby altering the phosphorylation state and function of its substrates (arrington2019identificationofthe pages 5-6, johnson2009proteinkinaseinhibitors pages 13-15).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of ABL2 depends on the presence of divalent metal ions, particularly Mg²⁺, which is required for proper coordination of ATP in the active site during the phosphoryl transfer reaction (johnson2009proteinkinaseinhibitors pages 13-15).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nABL2 displays substrate specificity that is determined in part by its structured SH2 and SH3 domains, which contribute to both substrate recognition and protein–protein interactions. In particular, studies indicate that ABL family kinases preferentially phosphorylate substrates exhibiting consensus motifs characterized by hydrophobic residues such as isoleucine, leucine, or valine at the –1 position relative to the targeted tyrosine, and a proline or aromatic residue at the +3 position (arrington2019identificationofthe pages 5-6). Experimentally derived substrate motifs for ABL kinases include sequences in which the tyrosine residue is embedded in a local context that favors phosphorylation and subsequent binding by SH2 domain–containing proteins, thereby facilitating signaling cascades associated with cytoskeletal reorganization and cell motility (arrington2019identificationofthe pages 6-7, mayro2022thecharacterizationof pages 29-34).\n\n5. Structure  \nABL2 features a modular architecture that is composed of an N‐terminal region that includes a CAP domain, followed by highly conserved SH3 and SH2 domains and a catalytic kinase (SH1) domain, and culminates in a long, more divergent C‐terminal tail. The N‐terminal region, which exhibits approximately 90% sequence similarity with ABL1, is essential for substrate recognition and regulatory inter‐domain interactions, whereas the C‐terminal region—characterized by additional F‐actin binding sites, an extra F‐actin binding motif, and a microtubule binding domain—confers specificity for cytoskeletal regulation (hayes2013abelsonkinasebased pages 34-38, mayro2022thecharacterizationof pages 17-24). Structural studies, including crystallographic analysis of Abl kinases and molecular dynamics simulations, have revealed key features such as the DFG motif in the activation loop, the positioning of the C‐helix, the hydrophobic spine, and the arrangement of the SH2 domain that all contribute to the enzyme’s active and inactive conformations. Unique to ABL2, in comparison to its paralogue ABL1 which shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm, ABL2 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm where its actin‐binding capacity underlies its role in modulating the cellular cytoskeleton (panjarian2013structureanddynamic pages 2-3, hayes2013abelsonkinasebased pages 64-66).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe activity of ABL2 is controlled by complex regulatory mechanisms that include intramolecular interactions, autophosphorylation events, and phosphorylation by upstream kinases such as Src. The autoinhibitory configuration is maintained via interactions between its SH3 domain and SH2–kinase linker, and these interactions can be disrupted by phosphorylation at key tyrosine residues such as those on the activation loop (e.g., analogous to Tyr412 in ABL1) and by phosphorylation events mediated by Src family kinases (hayes2013abelsonkinasebased pages 38-41, hantschel2012structureregulationsignaling pages 1-2). Post–translational modifications such as acetylation in the C-terminal region, ubiquitination leading to proteasomal degradation, and caspase cleavage further contribute to the regulation of ABL2 activity (hayes2013abelsonkinasebased pages 64-66, mayro2022thecharacterizationof pages 29-34). Additionally, ABL2 can undergo autophosphorylation, which not only enhances its catalytic activity but also serves as a mechanism for self-regulation through modification of its inhibitor-binding interfaces, as exemplified by its phosphorylation of ABI1, an established inhibitor (hayes2013abelsonkinasebased pages 38-41).\n\n7. Function  \nFunctionally, ABL2 plays a critical role in coordinating cytoskeletal remodeling in response to extracellular stimuli, thereby contributing to cell growth, adhesion, and motility. It phosphorylates a variety of substrates that regulate actin and microtubule dynamics including MYH10, cortactin (CTTN), and tubulin subunits such as TUBA1 and TUBB, which are crucial for the reorganization of the cytoskeleton (hayes2013abelsonkinasebased pages 38-41, hayes2013abelsonkinasebased pages 92-95). Through phosphorylation of key regulators like CRK, CRKL, DOK1, and ARHGAP35, ABL2 influences cell adhesion and migratory pathways by modulating the recruitment and localization of signaling molecules at the cell periphery (hayes2013abelsonkinasebased pages 38-41, hayes2013abelsonkinasebased pages 69-74). Moreover, ABL2 has been implicated in endocytosis regulation via substrates such as RIN1 and is also involved in the modulation of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, exemplified by its phosphorylation of PDGFRB (mayro2022thecharacterizationof pages 29-34, arrington2019identificationofthe pages 7-8). In the nervous system, ABL2 may regulate neurotransmission by phosphorylating synaptic proteins, and it has been shown to positively regulate chemokine-mediated T-cell migration and polarization, indicating a role in immune cell homing and tissue infiltration (hayes2013abelsonkinasebased pages 64-66, hoj2020thecharacterizationof pages 161-164).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral small molecule inhibitors developed for the ABL family, including imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib, target the ATP-binding pocket and have been used successfully in the context of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) driven by BCR–ABL fusion proteins. However, the efficacy of these inhibitors in solid tumors remains variable, likely reflecting the dual and context-dependent role of ABL2 in different cancer types, for instance its pro-invasive role in breast cancer versus its invasion-suppressive function in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (hayes2013abelsonkinasebased pages 209-213, hayes2013abelsonkinasebased pages 69-74). Additionally, novel allosteric inhibitors that target the myristoylated pocket, such as those known as STAMPs (e.g., GNF-2 and GNF-5), have emerged as alternative therapeutic strategies based on structural insights from Abl kinases (johnson2009proteinkinaseinhibitors pages 11-13, panjarian2013structureanddynamic pages 5-6). ABL2 is also co-opted by pathogens to reorganize the actin cytoskeleton for intracellular movement and host cell exit, thereby highlighting its role in infection-associated signaling cascades (hayes2013abelsonkinasebased pages 38-41, siveen2018roleofnon pages 2-4).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nTyrosine‑protein kinase CSK (gene: CSK, Uniprot ID: P41240), also known as C‑Src kinase or Protein‑tyrosine kinase CYL, is a cytosolic non‑receptor tyrosine kinase that occupies a critical regulatory position in the Src family kinase (SFK) network. CSK is evolutionarily conserved among vertebrates, with clear orthologs identified in diverse mammalian species such as human, mouse, and rat as well as in lower metazoans. Comparative sequence analyses and genome‐wide studies originally described by Manning and colleagues have placed CSK on a well‐defined phylogenetic branch within the human kinome; it belongs to the regulatory subset of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases that evolved in parallel with its substrate kinases. CSK and the SFKs have co‑evolved, with CSK emerging early in metazoan evolution to serve as an intrinsic inhibitory control mechanism over SFK activity. The conservation of CSK’s domain architecture and regulatory features across species underscores its indispensable role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by preventing aberrant activation of SFKs (fortner2022apoptosisregulationby pages 1-2, ia2010structuralelementsand pages 21-25).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nTyrosine‑protein kinase CSK catalyzes a phosphorylation reaction in which the γ‑phosphate group from ATP is transferred to a specific tyrosine residue on its substrate protein. The chemical reaction may be represented as follows:  \n  ATP + [protein]‑L‑tyrosine → ADP + [protein]‑L‑tyrosine‑phosphate + H⁺  \nWithin its regulatory role, CSK specifically phosphorylates a conserved tyrosine residue located in the C‑terminal tail of Src family kinases – for example, Tyr‑527 in c‑Src. The addition of the phosphate group converts the target tyrosine residue into a phosphotyrosine, which then engages in an intramolecular interaction with the SH2 domain of the same SFK. This interaction stabilizes the kinase in an autoinhibited conformation, thereby attenuating downstream signaling through pathways that control cell growth, differentiation, migration, and immune responses (fortner2022apoptosisregulationby pages 1-2, ia2010structuralelementsand pages 6-10).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of CSK is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions, which are essential cofactors for most protein kinases. Specifically, Mg²⁺ is required for the efficient coordination and binding of ATP within the kinase active site. The Mg²⁺ ion serves to neutralize the negative charges of the ATP phosphates, aligning the nucleotide properly for the phosphoryl transfer reaction. This coordination ensures that critical catalytic residues within the kinase domain interact appropriately with the ATP substrate, thus promoting efficient phosphoryl transfer to the substrate’s tyrosine hydroxyl group (ia2010structuralelementsand pages 21-25).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCSK exhibits a high degree of substrate specificity that is central to its function as a negative regulator of the SFKs. Its primary target is the conserved C‑terminal tail tyrosine residue present on Src family kinases. In the case of c‑Src, phosphorylation of Tyr‑527 results in the establishment of an intramolecular interaction between the phosphotyrosine and the kinase’s own SH2 domain, leading to the stabilization of a closed, inactive conformation. Although a detailed consensus linear motif for CSK has not been as comprehensively defined as for some serine/threonine kinases, combinatorial peptide library analyses have indicated that substrates phosphorylated by CSK tend to exhibit acidic determinants in combination with hydrophobic elements surrounding the target tyrosine. This structural context reinforces the specificity by which CSK recognizes only those tyrosine residues that conform to the distinctive sequence and conformational properties of SFK substrates, thereby minimizing the likelihood of off‑target phosphorylation (ia2010structuralelementsand pages 21-25, yaronbarir2024theintrinsicsubstrate pages 10-11).\n\n5. Structure  \nThe three-dimensional architecture of CSK is defined by a modular arrangement of distinct domains that work in concert to achieve precise substrate recognition and catalytic activity. CSK is composed of an N‑terminal SH3 domain, an adjacent SH2 domain, and a central kinase (catalytic) domain.  \n\n • The N‑terminal SH3 domain adopts a compact β‑barrel structure that is enriched in conserved aromatic residues. This domain primarily facilitates protein–protein interactions by binding to proline‑rich motifs (typically PxxP sequences) found in adaptor proteins and other regulatory partners. In addition, the SH3 domain can participate in homodimerization events which may further influence the spatial orientation and regulatory function of CSK within the cytosol (ia2010structuralelementsand pages 6-10, superti‐furga1995structure‐functionrelationshipsin pages 5-6).  \n\n • Immediately following the SH3 domain is the SH2 domain. Structurally, the SH2 domain is characterized by a central β‑sheet flanked by α‑helices. Its primary function is to bind phosphotyrosine-containing motifs, a property that is exploited in the membrane recruitment of CSK. Binding of the SH2 domain to phosphorylated membrane‑associated adaptor proteins, such as Cbp/PAG, facilitates the proper subcellular localization of CSK near its SFK substrates (ia2010structuralelementsand pages 21-25).  \n\n • The central kinase domain of CSK displays the classical bilobed structure seen in protein kinases. The smaller N‑lobe contains β‑sheets along with a key α‑helix (the C‑helix) involved in positioning ATP; in particular, a conserved lysine residue (e.g., Lys‑222 in CSK) within the β3‑strand is crucial for coordinating ATP binding. The larger C‑lobe, on the other hand, houses the activation loop – including the DFG motif that coordinates Mg²⁺ binding – and the substrate binding region featuring a hydrophobic spine. This hydrophobic spine, together with the C‑helix, ensures proper alignment of catalytic residues necessary for effective phosphoryl transfer. Unlike many tyrosine kinases that are themselves regulated through activation loop phosphorylation, CSK lacks a requisite autophosphorylation site in its activation segment, a feature that is consistent with its role as a negative regulator rather than an activator (ia2010structuralelementsand pages 33-37, ia2010structuralelementsand pages 48-50, ia2010structuralelementsand pages 50-52, ia2010structuralelementsand pages 6-10).  \n\nFurthermore, the structural integration between the SH3, SH2, and kinase domains provides an important layer of intramolecular communication. These domains interact through defined linker regions that facilitate allosteric transitions and ensure that changes in one domain can influence the conformation and catalytic efficiency of the kinase domain. Recent crystallographic data and comparative modeling also underscore that CSK lacks modifications such as an N‑terminal myristoylation signal that are typically present in SFKs, a characteristic that aligns with its functional distinction as a repressor of kinase signaling (kan2023domainarchitectureof pages 26-28).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe enzymatic activity of CSK is meticulously controlled via several regulatory mechanisms that include subcellular localization, post‑translational modifications, and allosteric conformational dynamics.  \n\n • A primary regulatory mechanism for CSK is its subcellular localization. CSK is recruited to the plasma membrane through the binding of its SH2 domain to phosphotyrosine motifs on membrane-associated adaptor proteins such as Cbp/PAG. This spatial targeting is essential because the SFK substrates of CSK are membrane-bound; by localizing near these substrates, CSK can effectively exert its inhibitory phosphorylation function (fortner2022apoptosisregulationby pages 1-2, hunter2015theeukaryoticprotein pages 1-3).  \n\n • Post‑translational modifications also play a role in regulating CSK activity. For example, phosphorylation events mediated by cAMP‑dependent protein kinase (PKA) at residues including Ser364 have been reported. Although the full spectrum of biochemical effects stemming from these modifications is still under investigation, phosphorylation at Ser364 is believed to modulate CSK’s catalytic efficiency and substrate interactions by inducing subtle changes in its conformation (sun2023dissectionofthe pages 10-11, shah2018thesrcmodule pages 1-3).  \n\n • In addition to phosphorylation, conformational regulation of CSK is achieved through allosteric mechanisms that involve the interdomain communication between the SH3, SH2, and kinase domains. Binding events involving the SH2 domain, such as engagement with phosphotyrosine ligands on adaptor proteins, trigger structural rearrangements that can either enhance or limit catalytic activity. There is also evidence suggesting that redox-sensitive regulation—through transient disulfide bond formation between conserved cysteine residues—might contribute to conformational modulation, although this mechanism has been described only in the context of broader regulatory studies (sun2023dissectionofthe pages 9-9, shah2018thesrcmodule pages 1-3).\n\n7. Function  \nCSK functions as an essential negative regulator in the signaling cascades mediated by Src family kinases. By specifically phosphorylating a conserved inhibitory tyrosine residue (for example, Tyr‑527 in c‑Src) located in the C‑terminal tail of SFKs, CSK enforces an intramolecular phosphotyrosine–SH2 interaction that shifts the affected SFK into a closed, inactive conformation. This autoinhibited state prevents spontaneous or inappropriate activation of SFKs and thereby downregulates downstream signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, motility, and immune responses.  \n\nIn immune cell regulation, CSK is critical for maintaining appropriate thresholds for T‑cell receptor (TCR) and B‑cell receptor (BCR) signal transduction. By phosphorylating and inactivating positive effectors such as FYN and LCK, CSK contributes to the fine‑tuning of antigen receptor signaling, thus preventing excessive immune responses and ensuring immune homeostasis. In addition, CSK influences cell adhesion and migration by modulating the activity of downstream targets such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin, which are involved in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and cell–matrix interactions. The tight control exerted by CSK over SFK activity serves as an important barrier against oncogenic transformation, since unchecked SFK activity is often correlated with increased cell proliferation and metastasis (fortner2022apoptosisregulationby pages 1-2, hunter2015theeukaryoticprotein pages 1-3).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nTo date, no inhibitors have been reported that are highly selective exclusively for CSK. Instead, available chemical probes and inhibitors typically target broader components of the Src kinase pathway. Owing to its central role in restraining SFK activity, dysregulation of CSK—whether through mutation, altered expression, or mislocalization—has been implicated in various disease states. These include certain cancers, where loss of CSK function can lead to hyperactive SFKs and consequently dysregulated cell growth and survival, as well as cardiovascular and neurological disorders in which aberrant SFK signaling disrupts normal cellular function. The absence of specific CSK inhibitors underscores the ongoing research interest in identifying molecules that can modulate its activity, a pursuit that may eventually lead to novel therapeutic strategies for conditions characterized by excessive SFK signaling (fortner2022apoptosisregulationby pages 1-2, sun2023dissectionofthe pages 9-9, superti‐furga1995structure‐functionrelationshipsin pages 5-6).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nMegakaryocyte‐associated tyrosine‐protein kinase (MATK), also known as CSK homologous kinase, HYL, or CTK, belongs to the non‐receptor tyrosine kinase family and is evolutionarily related to C‐terminal Src kinase (CSK). MATK shares conserved sequence and structural features with CSK; however, unlike the ubiquitously expressed CSK, MATK exhibits a restricted phylogenetic distribution, with orthologs identified predominantly in vertebrates—especially in hematopoietic cells and the brain (chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 1-2, grgurevich1997thecsklikeproteins pages 1-3). The kinase is situated within an evolutionary branch derived from the core signaling kinases present in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor, and its close relationship with CSK places it in a group of kinases that have co‐evolved with Src family kinases (grgurevich1997thecsklikeproteins pages 13-13). Comparative analyses indicate that while the catalytic domain of MATK is highly conserved with other members of the CSK family, its regulatory domains—most notably the SH2 domain—show adaptations that contribute to its tissue‐specific functions.\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nMATK catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to the phenolic hydroxyl group of specific tyrosine residues on its substrates. In particular, it phosphorylates the conserved C‐terminal regulatory tyrosine residue of Src family kinases, a modification that induces a closed, inactive conformation in these substrates. The chemical reaction can be summarized as follows:  \n  ATP + [protein]-Tyr → ADP + [protein]-pTyr + H⁺  \nThis reaction results in the conversion of the unphosphorylated tyrosine residue to a phosphorylated state, thereby downregulating the catalytic activity of Src family members (chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of MATK is dependent on divalent metal ion cofactors, with Mg²⁺ being essential for its catalytic function. As is typical for protein kinases, Mg²⁺ facilitates the proper binding of ATP within the active site and stabilizes the transition state during phosphoryl transfer (ia2010structuralelementsand pages 1-6).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nMATK exhibits a dual mechanism of substrate regulation that involves both catalytic phosphorylation and non‐catalytic inhibitory binding. Its primary catalytic activity is directed toward the phosphorylation of a conserved C‐terminal tyrosine residue present in Src family kinases, a residue that, when phosphorylated, serves as a negative regulatory site. Studies have indicated that while MATK (like CSK) can recognize an optimal phosphorylation sequence exemplified by motifs such as EEIYFFF, the strict physiological substrate specificity relies on both local amino acid sequence determinants and distal docking interactions contributed by its SH2 and SH3 domains (chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 8-9, ia2010structuralelementsand pages 25-29). In addition to its catalytic function, MATK can form stable complexes with active Src family kinases, thereby inhibiting their activity via a non‐catalytic mechanism that is independent of tyrosine phosphorylation (chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 8-9).\n\n5. Structure  \nMATK is organized into an N-terminal region followed by modular domains that are characteristic of the CSK family. It contains an SH3 domain and an SH2 domain, which are followed by a central catalytic (kinase) domain. The SH2 domain mediates interactions with phosphorylated tyrosine motifs on transmembrane and adaptor proteins, thereby recruiting MATK to specific subcellular locales such as the plasma membrane, where Src family kinases are concentrated (chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 1-2, chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 3-5).  \nWithin the kinase domain, conserved motifs such as the glycine-rich loop, the catalytic loop, and the activation loop are present. Although MATK lacks some regulatory features present in Src family kinases—such as autophosphorylation sites and a C-terminal inhibitory tyrosine—its catalytic core is highly similar to that of CSK, including the presence of a hydrophobic spine that is critical for positioning ATP and substrate for efficient phosphorylation (ia2010structuralelementsand pages 6-10, grgurevich1997thecsklikeproteins pages 1-3). Additionally, structural studies of the CSK family have revealed that the regulatory SH2 and SH3 domains can engage in inter-domain interactions with the kinase domain to modulate activity. Such interactions are thought to also occur in MATK, contributing to both its catalytic activation and substrate specificity (chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 2-3, ia2010structuralelementsand pages 50-52). No unique structural elements exclusive to MATK have been reported; instead, its regulation appears to mirror that of other CSK homologs with tissue-specific expression.\n\n6. Regulation  \nRegulatory mechanisms for MATK involve several layers of control. Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, play a central role in modulating its activity. MATK phosphorylates the C-terminal regulatory tyrosine on Src family kinases, thereby switching these kinases to an inactive conformation (chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 1-2). In addition, MATK itself can be regulated via phosphorylation events mediated by upstream kinases such as protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates residues (for example, Ser-364 in CSK, with similar mechanisms presumed for MATK) to stimulate full catalytic activity (ia2010structuralelementsand pages 21-25, chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 6-8).  \nBeyond direct phosphorylation, MATK regulation also involves subcellular localization. Its SH2 domain directs MATK to plasma membrane microdomains by binding to phosphotyrosine residues on adaptor proteins such as Cbp/PAG. In hematopoietic cells and platelets, this localization is critical; for instance, upon thrombin stimulation in platelets, MATK translocates from the soluble cytosolic fraction to the cytoskeletal compartment, which correlates with a release of inhibition on Src family kinase Lyn (hirao1997translocationofthe pages 1-2, hirao1997translocationofthe pages 9-10).  \nFurthermore, MATK can inhibit Src family kinases not only by phosphorylating them but also through forming stable, non-catalytic complexes. This dual regulatory mechanism ensures efficient negative control over Src family kinase signaling, particularly in contexts where precise modulation of signal transduction is required (chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 8-9).\n\n7. Function  \nMATK plays a significant role in the signal transduction pathways of hematopoietic cells and the brain. Its primary function is the negative regulation of Src family kinases through phosphorylation of their C-terminal regulatory tyrosine residues. This phosphorylation event locks Src family kinases in a closed, inactive conformation, thereby modulating downstream proliferative and differentiation signals (chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 1-2, chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 11-12).  \nIn hematopoietic cells, MATK is expressed predominantly in megakaryocytes, T lymphocytes, and natural killer cells, where it contributes to the control of cell proliferation and differentiation. For example, by suppressing the activity of Src family kinases such as Lck and Lyn, MATK plays an inhibitory role in T-cell proliferation and may help maintain the quiescent state in normal immune cells (kim2004differentialexpressionof pages 8-9, grgurevich1997thecsklikeproteins pages 9-11).  \nIn the central nervous system, MATK is expressed in neuronal populations where it is implicated in the regulation of neurite outgrowth, axonal guidance, and neuronal differentiation through controlling local Src family kinase activity (chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 5-6). This dual functionality—spanning hematopoietic regulation to neuronal signal transduction—underscores the importance of MATK in maintaining cellular homeostasis across diverse tissues.\n\n8. Other Comments  \nMATK’s unique dual mechanism of inhibition, involving both catalytic phosphorylation of Src family kinases and non-catalytic binding that sequesters active kinases, has generated interest in its potential as a tumor suppressor. In colorectal cancer, for example, epigenetic silencing of MATK has been observed, suggesting that loss of its inhibitory control over Src kinases may contribute to malignant transformation (chueh2021cskhomologouskinase(chkmatk) pages 1-4).  \nWhile there are currently no specific inhibitors developed solely against MATK, its structural and regulatory similarities to CSK imply that insights gained from CSK inhibitor studies may be applicable. The development of selective modulators that can enhance MATK activity or mimic its inhibitory interaction with Src family members holds potential for therapeutic intervention in cancers characterized by aberrant Src signaling (chong2005cterminalsrckinase pages 8-9, boubeva2011understandingtyrosinekinase pages 45-49).  \nAdditionally, the restricted expression of MATK in specific hematopoietic and neuronal cell types renders it a candidate for targeted studies in disorders associated with immune dysregulation and neurological abnormalities.\n\n9.

MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1 are the 2 MAPKs which play an important role in the MAPK/ERK cascade. They participate also in a signaling cascade initiated by activated KIT and KITLG/SCF. Depending on the cellular context, the MAPK/ERK cascade mediates diverse biological functions such as cell growth, adhesion, survival and differentiation through the regulation of transcription, translation, cytoskeletal rearrangements. The MAPK/ERK cascade also plays a role in initiation and regulation of meiosis, mitosis, and postmitotic functions in differentiated cells by phosphorylating a number of transcription factors. About 160 substrates have already been discovered for ERKs. Many of these substrates are localized in the nucleus, and seem to participate in the regulation of transcription upon stimulation. However, other substrates are found in the cytosol as well as in other cellular organelles, and those are responsible for processes such as translation, mitosis and apoptosis. Moreover, the MAPK/ERK cascade is also involved in the regulation of the endosomal dynamics, including lysosome processing and endosome cycling through the perinuclear recycling compartment (PNRC); as well as in the fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus during mitosis. The substrates include transcription factors (such as ATF2, BCL6, ELK1, ERF, FOS, HSF4 or SPZ1), cytoskeletal elements (such as CANX, CTTN, GJA1, MAP2, MAPT, PXN, SORBS3 or STMN1), regulators of apoptosis (such as BAD, BTG2, CASP9, DAPK1, IER3, MCL1 or PPARG), regulators of translation (such as EIF4EBP1 and FXR1) and a variety of other signaling-related molecules (like ARHGEF2, DCC, FRS2 or GRB10). Protein kinases (such as RAF1, RPS6KA1/RSK1, RPS6KA3/RSK2, RPS6KA2/RSK3, RPS6KA6/RSK4, SYK, MKNK1/MNK1, MKNK2/MNK2, RPS6KA5/MSK1, RPS6KA4/MSK2, MAPKAPK3 or MAPKAPK5) and phosphatases (such as DUSP1, DUSP4, DUSP6 or DUSP16) are other substrates which enable the propagation the MAPK/ERK signal to additional cytosolic and nuclear targets, thereby extending the specificity of the cascade. Mediates phosphorylation of TPR in response to EGF stimulation. May play a role in the spindle assembly checkpoint. Phosphorylates PML and promotes its interaction with PIN1, leading to PML degradation. Phosphorylates CDK2AP2 (By similarity).

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nMAPK1, commonly designated as ERK2, is a member of the conventional mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) family within the CMGC group. Orthologs of ERK2 are found across eukaryotic species and its evolutionary conservation is evident among metazoans, fungi, and plants. In vertebrates, ERK2 and its close isoform ERK1 (MAPK3) emerged from an ancestral gene duplication event and are ubiquitously expressed, although ERK2 is often essential for normal development, with knockout studies underscoring its nonredundant roles in embryogenesis and cell survival (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 2-4, kultz1998phylogeneticandfunctional pages 1-2, busca2016erk1anderk2 pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nERK2 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to specific serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins. This reaction is represented as:  \n  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺  \nThis phosphorylation event modulates protein function by altering conformation or interaction properties without direct interpretation of downstream effects (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 2-4).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of ERK2 requires divalent metal ion cofactors, with Mg²⁺ serving as the preferred ion to coordinate the phosphates of ATP and facilitate phosphoryl transfer (kultz1998phylogeneticandfunctional pages 2-3).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nERK2 is classified as a proline‐directed serine/threonine kinase. It exhibits a substrate specificity characterized by the recognition of phosphorylatable serine/threonine residues that are immediately followed by a proline, forming a consensus motif of [S/T]–P. In addition, substrate binding and specificity are refined by docking interactions involving distinct docking motifs such as the D-domain and the DEF domain present in many of its substrates; these motifs interact with complementary docking grooves on ERK2 thereby ensuring efficient catalysis and substrate selection (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 2-4, roux2004erkandp38 pages 1-1, martinvega2023navigatingtheerk12 pages 32-33).\n\n5. Structure  \nERK2 features a bilobed kinase domain that is typical of protein kinases. The N-terminal lobe is predominantly composed of β-strands and contains the glycine-rich loop critical for ATP binding, while the larger C-terminal lobe is mainly α-helical and houses the catalytic loop. Central to its structure is the activation loop, which contains a highly conserved TEY (threonine–glutamate–tyrosine) motif; dual phosphorylation at the threonine and tyrosine residues within this loop is required for full catalytic activation. In addition, ERK2’s structure includes a conserved C-terminal common docking (CD) domain that is essential for binding substrates, upstream activators, and phosphatases. These structural elements—including the hydrophobic spine and correctly positioned C-helix—are pivotal for stabilizing the active conformation of the kinase and for facilitating efficient phosphoryl transfer reactions (kultz1998phylogeneticandfunctional pages 15-17, meister2013mitogenactivatedprotein(map) pages 1-4, martinvega2023navigatingtheerk12 pages 33-34).\n\n6. Regulation  \nERK2 is regulated via multiple mechanisms. The primary mode of activation is through dual phosphorylation of the TEY motif located in the activation loop by MAP kinase kinases (MEK1 and MEK2). This phosphorylation event induces conformational rearrangements that realign catalytic residues and open the substrate binding cleft. In addition to activation, ERK2 is subject to deactivation by dual specificity phosphatases (MKPs) such as DUSP6, which dephosphorylate both the threonine and tyrosine residues, thereby attenuating its activity. Furthermore, regulatory proteins and scaffolds contribute to the spatial and temporal control of ERK2 signaling. For example, interactions with scaffold proteins help sequester ERK2 in specific subcellular compartments and modulate its access to both substrates and upstream kinases, while feedback phosphorylation events on upstream components also contribute to tightly regulated signal output (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 2-4, busca2016erk1anderk2 pages 19-19, theodosiou2002mapkinasephosphatases pages 8-9).\n\n7. Function  \nERK2 is a central component of the MAPK/ERK signaling cascade and plays a vital role in transmitting extracellular signals to intracellular targets. It is ubiquitously expressed and phosphorylates a broad spectrum of substrates, including transcription factors (such as ATF2, ELK1, FOS), cytoskeletal proteins, regulators of apoptosis, and components involved in translation control. Through these phosphorylations, ERK2 influences diverse biological processes including cell growth, adhesion, survival, and differentiation. ERK2 is also implicated in the regulation of cell cycle progression during meiosis and mitosis, and it contributes to postmitotic functions by modulating protein interactions and gene expression in differentiated cells. Furthermore, its involvement in signaling pathways initiated by activated receptor tyrosine kinases such as KIT underscores its pivotal role in both development and maintenance of normal cellular functions (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 2-4, dickinson2006diversephysiologicalfunctions pages 1-3, martinvega2023navigatingtheerk12 pages 7-8).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral pharmacological inhibitors targeting the MAPK/ERK pathway have been developed owing to the central role of ERK2 in oncogenic processes. Inhibitors that act on upstream activators (e.g., MEK inhibitors such as PD184352 and PD0325901) indirectly affect ERK2 activation, while there is ongoing research into direct ERK2 inhibitors. Dysregulation of ERK2, including aberrant phosphorylation and altered substrate interactions, is associated with various cancers and developmental disorders. Mutations or altered regulation of upstream pathway components such as Ras or Raf can lead to constitutive activation of ERK2, contributing to uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Additionally, specific docking domain mutations that affect substrate or regulatory protein binding may also contribute to disease. The broad substrate repertoire of ERK2, which includes over 160 identified substrates, highlights both its complexity and its potential as a therapeutic target when its regulation is compromised (roux2004erkandp38 pages 1-2, busca2016erk1anderk2 pages 22-22).\n\n9.

MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1 are the 2 MAPKs which play an important role in the MAPK/ERK cascade. They participate also in a signaling cascade initiated by activated KIT and KITLG/SCF. Depending on the cellular context, the MAPK/ERK cascade mediates diverse biological functions such as cell growth, adhesion, survival and differentiation through the regulation of transcription, translation, cytoskeletal rearrangements. The MAPK/ERK cascade also plays a role in initiation and regulation of meiosis, mitosis, and postmitotic functions in differentiated cells by phosphorylating a number of transcription factors. About 160 substrates have already been discovered for ERKs. Many of these substrates are localized in the nucleus, and seem to participate in the regulation of transcription upon stimulation. However, other substrates are found in the cytosol as well as in other cellular organelles, and those are responsible for processes such as translation, mitosis and apoptosis. Moreover, the MAPK/ERK cascade is also involved in the regulation of the endosomal dynamics, including lysosome processing and endosome cycling through the perinuclear recycling compartment (PNRC); as well as in the fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus during mitosis. The substrates include transcription factors (such as ATF2, BCL6, ELK1, ERF, FOS, HSF4 or SPZ1), cytoskeletal elements (such as CANX, CTTN, GJA1, MAP2, MAPT, PXN, SORBS3 or STMN1), regulators of apoptosis (such as BAD, BTG2, CASP9, DAPK1, IER3, MCL1 or PPARG), regulators of translation (such as EIF4EBP1) and a variety of other signaling-related molecules (like ARHGEF2, DEPTOR, FRS2 or GRB10) (PubMed:35216969). Protein kinases (such as RAF1, RPS6KA1/RSK1, RPS6KA3/RSK2, RPS6KA2/RSK3, RPS6KA6/RSK4, SYK, MKNK1/MNK1, MKNK2/MNK2, RPS6KA5/MSK1, RPS6KA4/MSK2, MAPKAPK3 or MAPKAPK5) and phosphatases (such as DUSP1, DUSP4, DUSP6 or DUSP16) are other substrates which enable the propagation the MAPK/ERK signal to additional cytosolic and nuclear targets, thereby extending the specificity of the cascade**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nMAPK3, commonly known as ERK1, belongs to the mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) family of serine/threonine kinases, a group that is widely conserved across eukaryotes. ERK1 forms one of the two closely related isoforms (ERK1 and ERK2) within the conventional ERK subfamily. ERK1 shows high amino acid sequence similarity with ERK2 (approximately 83% identity), and both isoforms are ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues. Phylogenetically, ERK1 is part of the CMGC group of kinases, which comprises other families such as cyclin‐dependent kinases (CDKs) and glycogen synthase kinases (GSKs). This evolutionary conservation reflects the central and ancient role of the MAPK/ERK module in cellular signaling, with orthologs detected from lower eukaryotes such as yeast up through vertebrates (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 2-4, keshet2010themapkinase pages 9-11, li2011evolutionaryhistoryof pages 11-12). The evolutionary context places ERK1 as part of a tightly regulated kinase cascade that emerged early in eukaryotic evolution, with gene duplications giving rise to the ERK1 and ERK2 isoforms that now operate in highly integrated signaling networks (krishna2008thecomplexityof pages 2-4).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nThe catalytic reaction executed by MAPK3/ERK1 is the phosphoryl transfer from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues present in target proteins. The general chemical reaction can be summarized as:  \n  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺  \nThis reaction underlies the mechanism whereby ERK1 modulates the function of a wide array of substrates involved in processes such as transcription regulation, cell cycle control, and cytoskeletal rearrangements (pearson2001mitogenactivatedprotein(map) pages 1-2, cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 2-4).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nMAPK3/ERK1, like other serine/threonine kinases, requires the presence of divalent cations for its catalytic activity. The principal cofactor is Mg²⁺, which is essential for the binding of ATP to the active site and proper positioning of the γ-phosphate for transfer to the target residue. Mg²⁺ thereby facilitates the catalysis and overall enzymatic activity of ERK1 (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 2-4, pearson2001mitogenactivatedprotein(map) pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nERK1 is characterized as a proline-directed serine/threonine kinase. Its catalytic activity is directed primarily toward consensus substrates that harbor serine or threonine followed immediately by a proline residue. This specificity, primarily driven by the structural configuration of the kinase domain and a conserved docking groove, enables ERK1 to phosphorylate a multitude of substrates including transcription factors such as ELK1, ATF2, and components involved in cytoskeletal organization (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 2-4, guo2020erkmapksignallingpathway pages 2-4, pearson2001mitogenactivatedprotein(map) pages 1-2). High-throughput proteomic analyses of human serine/threonine kinases have further confirmed that ERK1 preferentially recognizes motifs that conform to a p[ST]P consensus, guiding its phosphorylation events and ensuring signal propagation with high fidelity (krishna2008thecomplexityof pages 2-4).\n\n5. Structure  \nMAPK3/ERK1 possesses a conserved kinase catalytic core that adopts a bilobed architecture typical of eukaryotic protein kinases. The N-terminal lobe is primarily composed of β-sheets and contains a glycine-rich loop that helps coordinate ATP binding, whereas the larger C-terminal lobe is predominantly helical and provides the substrate binding site. A central feature of this kinase is the activation loop, which contains a conserved Thr–Glu–Tyr (TEY) motif; dual phosphorylation of the threonine and tyrosine residues within this loop is required for full catalytic activation (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 2-4, keshet2010themapkinase pages 9-11, lavoie2020erksignallinga pages 1-2). Structural studies have revealed that upon phosphorylation, the activation loop repositions to create an optimal alignment of the catalytic residues and to form a substrate-binding pocket that facilitates recognition of proline-directed motifs. Additionally, ERK1 contains specific docking domains—often referred to as CD (common docking) sites—that mediate interactions with upstream kinases (e.g., MEK1/2), substrates, and regulatory proteins, ensuring the spatial and temporal specificity of its signaling outputs (kirsch2021noncanonicalinteractionsof pages 4-7, pearson2001mitogenactivatedprotein(map) pages 2-3). The overall structure, often modeled by high-resolution crystallography and supported by AlphaFold predictions, underscores how the interface between the N-terminal lobe and C-terminal lobe forms the catalytic cleft where both ATP and substrate peptides concurrently bind (keshet2010themapkinase pages 9-11).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe activity of MAPK3/ERK1 is tightly regulated by multiple mechanisms, ensuring that its kinase activity is coordinated precisely with cellular needs. A principal mode of regulation is through dual phosphorylation of its activation loop by the upstream dual-specificity kinases MEK1 and MEK2. Phosphorylation of both threonine and tyrosine residues in the TEY motif induces a conformational change that is necessary to achieve full catalytic activity (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 2-4, kyriakis2012mammalianmapksignal pages 10-11). In addition, ERK1 is subject to regulation by a cohort of scaffold proteins which bind to specific docking domains on ERK1, bringing it into close proximity with its activators and substrates. These scaffolds, including proteins such as KSR and others, serve to compartmentalize the ERK module within subcellular locations and thereby increase the efficiency of signal transduction (lavoie2020erksignallinga pages 1-2, keshet2010themapkinase pages 1-4). Deactivation of ERK1 is mediated by dual specificity phosphatases (DUSPs), such as DUSP6, which remove the activating phosphate groups thereby returning ERK1 to an inactive state (theodosiou2002mapkinasephosphatases pages 4-5, raman2007differentialregulationand pages 1-2). Further regulatory inputs include transient interactions with additional protein kinases and phosphatases that fine-tune its activity, as well as potential feedback mechanisms that modulate the intensity and duration of the downstream signaling cascade (guo2020erkmapksignallingpathway pages 1-2, kirsch2021noncanonicalinteractionsof pages 94-97).\n\n7. Function  \nMAPK3/ERK1 plays a central role in the MAPK/ERK signaling cascade and is pivotal for the regulation of diverse biological processes. Upon activation, ERK1 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where it phosphorylates various transcription factors such as ELK1, ATF2, and FOS, thereby modulating gene expression programs associated with cell growth, differentiation, and survival. In addition to its nuclear functions, ERK1 also phosphorylates cytosolic substrates that regulate processes including translation, cytoskeletal rearrangements, and endosomal dynamics. This kinase is involved in regulating key aspects of the cell cycle, including the initiation and regulation of both mitosis and meiosis, ensuring proper cell division and differentiation (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 2-4, guo2020erkmapksignallingpathway pages 2-4, lai2015investigationsofthe pages 49-55). In many cell types—such as those in the brain, skeletal muscle, thymus, and heart—high levels of ERK1 expression underscore its role in maintaining tissue-specific functions. ERK1 also participates in signaling cascades initiated by receptor tyrosine kinases (for example, in response to growth factors like EGF and PDGF) and by other receptors including those activated by KIT ligand, supporting its involvement in processes such as cell adhesion, survival, and differentiation (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 2-4, lavoie2020erksignallinga pages 1-2, roberts2007targetingtherafmekerk pages 1-2).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral small-molecule inhibitors have been developed that block components of the MAPK/ERK pathway by targeting upstream kinases (such as MEK inhibitors) or by interfering with ERK1 activity directly. These inhibitors are under clinical evaluation for their potential therapeutic benefits in cancers and other diseases characterized by hyperactive MAPK signaling. In addition, mutations or dysregulation of the ERK pathway have been implicated in oncogenesis as well as in developmental disorders and various pathologies where aberrant cell proliferation and survival signals prevail (samadani2015smallmoleculeinhibitorsof pages 16-17, roberts2007targetingtherafmekerk pages 1-2). The extensive substrate repertoire of ERK1—over 160 identified substrates, including transcription factors, cytoskeletal proteins, and regulators of apoptosis and translation—underscores its role as a master regulator of cell physiology. This central position in signaling networks makes MAPK3/ERK1 an attractive target for therapeutic intervention, and ongoing research continues to expand the list of its substrates and interacting partners, further elucidating its function in both normal and disease states (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 1-1, guo2020erkmapksignallingpathway pages 2-4).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals.

Phylogeny  \nMAPK4 (also referred to as ERK4 or PRKM4) belongs to the atypical mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) subfamily. It is evolutionarily related to ERK3, with both atypical MAPKs sharing approximately 73% amino acid identity within their kinase domains. These kinases do not exhibit the classical Thr–X–Tyr activation loop motif seen in conventional MAPKs but instead contain a single phospho‐acceptor site within an S–E–G (Ser–Glu–Gly) motif. The presence and conservation of this atypical activation loop, together with a unique Ser–Pro–Arg motif present in subdomain VIII (replacing the typical A–P–E motif), situate MAPK4 in a distinct evolutionary branch among vertebrate MAPKs. MAPK4 and its close homolog ERK3 are restricted to vertebrates, and their gene structures along with their kinase domain features suggest that both proteins arose from a gene duplication event in a chordate ancestor (al2015identificationofnovela pages 19-23, coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 2-4, rousseau2009caractérisationdela pages 55-59).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nThe catalytic reaction mediated by MAPK4 is the transfer of the γ‐phosphate from ATP to a hydroxyl group of specific serine/threonine residues on substrate proteins. This reaction can be represented as: ATP + [protein]–OH → ADP + [protein]–O–PO3^2– + H^+ (al2015identificationofnovel pages 19-23).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nMAPK4 requires divalent cations such as Mg^2+ for its catalytic activity, which is consistent with the cofactor needs of most serine/threonine kinases (al2015identificationofnovelc pages 19-23).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nMAPK4 exhibits a narrow substrate specificity. The best characterized substrate is MAPK‐activated protein kinase 5 (MK5, also known as PRAK). Upon interaction, MAPK4 is phosphorylated at Ser-186 in its activation loop by upstream group I p21-activated kinases (PAKs); this phosphorylation event is required for the subsequent phosphorylation and activation of MK5. In addition, MAPK4 has been reported to phosphorylate microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2). However, no definitive consensus phosphorylation motif has been fully described for MAPK4 beyond its apparent preference for substrates like MK5, and no additional direct physiological substrates have been conclusively identified (al2015identificationofnovelb pages 19-23, almahi2013theregulationofa pages 19-23, meloche2010inhibitionofcdk1cyclin pages 296-300).\n\n5. Structure  \nMAPK4 is a 587 amino acid protein with an approximate molecular mass of 70 kDa. Its structure comprises a centrally located catalytic kinase domain near the N-terminus and a long C-terminal extension. The kinase domain contains an atypical activation loop that harbors a single phospho-acceptor site within the S–E–G motif, rather than the dual-specificity Thr–X–Tyr motif found in conventional MAPKs. Additionally, in subdomain VIII, MAPK4 features a distinct S–P–R motif in place of the usual A–P–E sequence. These structural deviations underlie the unique regulatory and substrate recognition properties of MAPK4. The protein mainly localizes to the cytoplasm, where its association with MK5 is crucial for the complex’s function. Structural models based on homology with ERK3 and related atypical MAPKs indicate that these unique motifs may influence the stabilization of the kinase domain’s C-terminal lobe and the overall arrangement of the hydrophobic spine and C-helix, thus affecting substrate binding (al2015identificationofnovela pages 19-23, coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 2-4, barbagallo2018exploringtheroles pages 15-19).\n\n6. Regulation  \nMAPK4 is regulated primarily by phosphorylation. Group I p21-activated kinases (PAK1/2/3) phosphorylate MAPK4 at Ser-186 within its activation loop; this modification is integral for achieving catalytic competence and stabilizing the interaction with substrate proteins such as MK5. Interaction with MK5 further promotes cytoplasmic accumulation, and studies show that genetic ablation of MAPK4 results in a significant reduction in MK5 activity. Additionally, reciprocal phosphorylation events have been observed, in which activated MK5 can, in turn, phosphorylate MAPK4. Despite these findings, the full extent of upstream activators, the involvement of additional post-translational modifications (such as ubiquitination), and the precise allosteric regulation of MAPK4 remain to be fully elucidated (almahi2013theregulationof pages 19-23, meloche2010inhibitionofcdk1cyclin pages 296-300, rousseau2009caractérisationdela pages 55-59).\n\n7. Function  \nMAPK4 functions as an atypical signaling kinase and is implicated in the regulation of downstream effectors primarily via its substrate MK5. The phosphorylation and activation of MK5 are critical steps that may influence cellular processes such as cell motility, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and potentially cell cycle entry. Although the precise physiological roles of MAPK4 remain unclear, evidence points to its involvement in complex phosphorylation cascades wherein the MAPK4–MK5 complex modulates signal transduction pathways that can affect cell behavior. The available data also suggest that the MAPK4–MK5 signaling module may have roles in neurobehavioral processes, as indicated by altered behavioral phenotypes in knockout studies; however, MAPK4-specific physiological substrates besides MK5 are yet to be definitively characterized (al2015identificationofnovel pages 19-23, almahi2013theregulationofa pages 19-23, meloche2010inhibitionofcdk1cyclin pages 296-300).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nCurrently, there are no specific inhibitors that have been definitively shown to selectively target MAPK4 in clinical settings. The atypical nature and distinct regulatory mechanisms of MAPK4 compared to classical MAPKs have contributed to the limited identification of additional physiological substrates and downstream effectors. Moreover, while MAPK4 has been implicated by similarity in promoting cell cycle entry, its exact role in disease states, including potential associations with cancer or neurological disorders, has yet to be firmly established in the peer-reviewed literature. The available studies highlight a need for further investigation into the biochemical properties and cellular functions of MAPK4, including identification of novel substrates and elucidation of any disease-associated mutations (al2015identificationofnovelc pages 19-23, rousseau2009caractérisationdela pages 90-94).\n\n9.

Phylogeny  \nMAPK6, also known as ERK3, is classified as an atypical mitogen‐activated protein kinase that belongs to a distinct subfamily of MAP kinases found exclusively in vertebrates (kultz1998phylogeneticandfunctional pages 5-9). It shares approximately 73% amino acid identity in its kinase domain with its closest relative, ERK4, indicating a common ancestry through a gene duplication event that gave rise to a separate subgroup within the MAPK family (coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 2-4). Evolutionary analyses place ERK3 alongside other MAPKs in which the canonical dual‐phosphorylation motif (TXY) is absent, instead possessing a single phosphoacceptor motif (SEG) that distinguishes its regulatory mechanism from conventional MAPKs (kultz1998phylogeneticandfunctional pages 1-2). Its restricted orthology, with no counterparts reported in invertebrates or plants, underscores its vertebrate-specific role in cellular signaling (kultz1998phylogeneticandfunctional pages 13-14). The phylogenetic context is further supported by large-scale studies of the human kinome that outline its evolution from a common ancestral kinase present in early eukaryotes, with subsequent divergence to perform specialized functions distinct from those of classical ERKs (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 1-1).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nMAPK6/ERK3 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to substrate proteins containing serine/threonine residues. The chemical reaction can be represented as: ATP + [protein] → ADP + [protein]-phosphorylated + H⁺ (template). This phosphorylation reaction is typical of serine/threonine kinases and forms the basis for its role in modulating downstream signaling events (coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of MAPK6/ERK3 depends on the presence of divalent cations, with magnesium (Mg²⁺) being a required cofactor for its kinase activity (template). This requirement facilitates the binding of ATP and proper positioning within the active site during the phosphorylation reaction (coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nMAPK6/ERK3 displays a narrow substrate specificity relative to classical MAPKs. It has been shown to phosphorylate microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and the MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 5 (MK5), with the latter interaction involving a complex set of reciprocal phosphorylation events (Information section). The kinase activity of ERK3 involves phosphorylation at serine 189 within its atypical SEG activation motif and the subsequent activation of MK5 through phosphorylation at its activation loop residue, a process that is further coupled with a feedback loop wherein MK5 phosphorylates ERK3 (elkhadragy2024roleofthe pages 2-4). Although detailed consensus substrate motifs have not been comprehensively defined in the literature, the available data indicate that ERK3 preferentially targets substrates requiring phosphorylation on serine/threonine residues within non-canonical sequence contexts (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 8-9).\n\n5. Structure  \nMAPK6/ERK3 is a 721-amino acid protein featuring a distinct domain organization. The N-terminal region incorporates a kinase domain that shows roughly 45–50% sequence homology with conventional ERKs, yet it is distinguished by the presence of a single phosphoacceptor serine within the SEG activation motif instead of the typical TXY motif found in classical MAPKs (coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 2-4). Adjacent to this kinase domain is a conserved C34 domain which is shared with ERK4, suggesting a role in mediating protein–protein interactions and possibly influencing subcellular localization (elkhadragy2024roleofthe pages 1-2). The C-terminal region is unusually long compared to classical MAPKs and is enriched in multiple phosphorylation sites that contribute to the regulation of its catalytic activity and turnover (schumacher2004scaffoldingbyerk3 pages 1-2). Structural studies based on crystallography and homology models, as reported for related atypical MAPKs, have identified key catalytic features such as the catalytic loop, the activation segment containing the SEG motif (with Ser189 being crucial), the hydrophobic regulatory spine, and a conserved C-helix (schroder2020crystalstructureand pages 1-3). In addition, the presence of an atypical SRP (serine–arginine–proline) motif in lieu of the canonical APE motif in subdomain VIII further contributes to its unique structural and functional properties (coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 2-4). These unique structural features underscore the divergence of ERK3 from conventional MAPKs and provide the structural basis for its atypical regulation and substrate interactions (schroder2020crystalstructureand pages 10-12).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of MAPK6/ERK3 occurs primarily through non-canonical mechanisms that involve both phosphorylation and protein turnover. A critical regulatory event is the phosphorylation of the activation loop at serine 189, which can occur via autophosphorylation or through the action of group I p21-activated kinases (PAKs) (elkhadragy2024roleofthe pages 15-16). This phosphorylation event is essential for the subsequent formation of a signaling complex with MAPKAPK5 (MK5), whereby ERK3 and MK5 undergo reciprocal phosphorylation events that modulate their respective activities (elkhadragy2024roleofthe pages 2-4, seternes2004activationofmk5prak pages 11-12). In addition to phosphorylation, ERK3 regulation is also achieved at the level of protein stability using ubiquitin-proteasome pathways, although detailed ubiquitination mechanisms are more extensively described in other atypical MAPKs (schumacher2004scaffoldingbyerk3 pages 1-2, coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 10-11). Nuclear export signals (NES) within its structure contribute to its dynamic nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and thereby influence its access to substrates (schumacher2004scaffoldingbyerk3 pages 1-2). These regulatory mechanisms ensure that the kinase activity of ERK3 is tightly moderated, allowing precise control over the phosphorylation events that influence various downstream signaling pathways (elkhadragy2024roleofthe pages 15-16).\n\n7. Function  \nMAPK6/ERK3 is implicated in phosphorylating key substrates that are involved in diverse cellular processes. Notably, ERK3 phosphorylates microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and plays an integral role in the activation of MAPKAPK5 (MK5) through a signaling module that involves reciprocal phosphorylation events (Information section, elkhadragy2024roleofthe pages 2-4). The formation of a complex with MK5, where ERK3 is phosphorylated at Ser189 and subsequently facilitates MK5 activation, constitutes an essential component of its function (seternes2004activationofmk5prak pages 11-12). This module has been associated with the promotion of cell cycle entry, although the precise mechanistic details remain to be fully elucidated (Information section). Expression studies indicate that ERK3 is ubiquitously expressed in several tissues, with relatively higher levels observed in brain, skeletal muscle, and the gastrointestinal tract (coulombe2007atypicalmitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2). Furthermore, the kinase is implicated in modulating cellular processes such as cytoskeletal organization and potentially transcription regulation through its substrates and interacting partners, thereby playing roles in cellular differentiation and proliferation (ronkina2019germlinedeletion pages 20-23). The reciprocal activation between ERK3 and MK5 might also interface with other signaling pathways that govern cell survival and growth (elkhadragy2024roleofthe pages 2-4, schroder2020crystalstructureand pages 10-12).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nPreliminary studies using structural analyses and inhibitor screening have identified several compounds with reversible and irreversible inhibitory effects on ERK3, although no inhibitor has yet been exclusively validated for clinical use (schroder2020crystalstructureand pages 10-12). Additionally, the atypical regulatory mechanisms, such as the utilization of non-canonical phosphorylation events and fast turnover via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, distinguish ERK3 from classical MAPKs and make it an emerging therapeutic target in the context of aberrant cell cycle progression and cancer biology (elkhadragy2024roleofthe pages 15-16). Although the direct causal associations with specific disease states are still under investigation, the reported role of ERK3 in forming a signaling complex with MK5 and its potential influence on cell cycle entry may have implications in tumorigenesis and proliferative disorders (ronkina2019germlinedeletion pages 20-23). Recent crystallographic efforts have provided insight into its ATP-binding site and active conformation, thereby laying the groundwork for future rational drug design aimed at selectively targeting this atypical MAPK (schroder2020crystalstructureand pages 1-3).\n\n9.

The upstream activator of MAPK7 is the MAPK kinase MAP2K5. Upon activation, it translocates to the nucleus and phosphorylates various downstream targets including MEF2C. EGF activates MAPK7 through a Ras-independent and MAP2K5-dependent pathway. As part of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, acts as a negative regulator of apoptosis in cardiomyocytes via interaction with STUB1/CHIP and promotion of STUB1-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of ICER-type isoforms of CREM (By similarity). May have a role in muscle cell differentiation. May be important for endothelial function and maintenance of blood vessel integrity. MAP2K5 and MAPK7 interact specifically with one another and not with MEK1/ERK1 or MEK2/ERK2 pathways.

S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nMAPK7, also known as ERK5, BMK1 or PRKM7, belongs to the mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) family and is phylogenetically distinct from the classical ERK1/2 subfamily. Its orthologs have been identified in all vertebrates, reflecting its evolutionary conservation across mammalian species (nishimoto2006mapksignallingerk5 pages 1-2). Within the human kinome it is placed in the ERK group, which originates from an ancestral MAPK module conserved since early eukaryotic evolution; the divergence that gave rise to ERK5 set it apart from other MAPKs by acquisition of a large C-terminal extension imparting transcriptional regulatory functions (nithianandarajahjones2014theroleof pages 1-3, lin2016erk5kinaseactivity pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nMAPK7 catalyzes the transfer of the γ-phosphate from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to serine/threonine residues within specific substrate proteins. In this reaction, ATP and a protein substrate are converted to ADP and a phosphorylated protein product, releasing a proton (cook2020smallmoleculeerk5 pages 16-17).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of MAPK7 is dependent on the presence of Mg²⁺ ions, which are required as cofactors to facilitate ATP binding and phosphoryl transfer (wang2006regulationofcellular pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nMAPK7 phosphorylates proteins on serine/threonine residues within specific consensus motifs. Notably, downstream substrates include transcription factors such as MEF2C and other regulatory proteins including SGK1, phosphorylated at Ser-78 to facilitate growth factor-induced cell cycle progression (cook2020smallmoleculeerk5 pages 14-15, cook2020smallmoleculeerk5 pages 15-16). Although precise consensus sequences are not exhaustively characterized in the available literature, its substrate preference is consistent with other serine/threonine kinases in the MAPK family, which generally recognize proline-directed motifs (nithianandarajahjones2014theroleof pages 10-12).\n\n5. Structure  \nMAPK7 is an 816–amino acid protein organized into two principal regions. The N-terminal region comprises a canonical kinase domain sharing approximately 50–66% sequence identity with other ERKs (lin2016erk5kinaseactivity pages 1-2, elkins2013xraycrystalstructure pages 7-8). This domain contains key catalytic elements including the activation loop with the conserved TEY (Thr218–Glu–Tyr220) phosphorylation motif, a glycine-rich loop, and structural features such as the hydrophobic spine and the C-helix that orient ATP for catalysis. Uniquely, MAPK7 possesses a large C-terminal extension of approximately 410 amino acids that harbors a nuclear localization signal and a transcriptional activation domain, thereby conferring dual functionality as both a kinase and a transcriptional regulator (cook2020smallmoleculeerk5 pages 14-15, monti2022clinicalsignificanceand pages 2-4). Structural studies, including X-ray crystallography of the kinase domain, have established details of its ATP-binding pocket and key residues that differentiate its inhibitor-binding profile from those of other MAPKs (elkins2013xraycrystalstructure pages 7-8).\n\n6. Regulation  \nMAPK7 is activated by phosphorylation of its activation loop at the TEY motif by its specific upstream kinase, MAP2K5 (MEK5). This phosphorylation event induces conformational changes that relieve autoinhibition imparted by the C-terminal domain, thereby unmasking the nuclear localization signal and allowing translocation into the nucleus (lin2016erk5kinaseactivity pages 1-2, lochhead2020paradoxicalactivationof pages 1-2). Beyond this primary event, MAPK7 undergoes autophosphorylation on its C-terminal tail, which further enhances its transcriptional activity (cook2020smallmoleculeerk5 pages 14-15). Additional phosphorylation events at sites such as Thr732, among others, have been correlated with nuclear accumulation and modulation of transcriptional outputs (honda2015phosphorylationoferk5 pages 13-14). Regulation is also achieved through protein–protein interactions; for example, binding to chaperones such as HSP90/CDC37 in the inactive state maintains MAPK7 in a closed conformation until appropriate extracellular signals via receptor tyrosine kinases, including EGF receptors, trigger its activation through a Ras-independent, but MEK5-dependent pathway (cook2020smallmoleculeerk5 pages 15-16, paudel2021themek5erk5pathway pages 1-2).\n\n7. Function  \nMAPK7 functions in several central cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, and cell survival. Upon activation by MEK5, MAPK7 translocates to the nucleus where it phosphorylates downstream targets such as MEF2C, thereby modulating gene transcription necessary for cellular responses to growth factors (cook2020smallmoleculeerk5 pages 14-15, drew2012mek5erk5pathwaythe pages 12-14). Additionally, MAPK7 phosphorylates SGK1 at Ser-78, an event that is required for cell cycle progression in response to growth factor signaling (Information section; cook2020smallmoleculeerk5 pages 15-16). In cardiomyocytes, MAPK7 acts as a negative regulator of apoptosis through its interaction with STUB1/CHIP, promoting ubiquitination and degradation of ICER-type isoforms of CREM, while in muscle cells it may be linked to differentiation processes (Information section). MAPK7 has also been implicated in the maintenance of endothelial integrity and blood vessel function, thereby contributing to vascular homeostasis (lochhead2012erk5andits pages 4-5).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral small-molecule inhibitors of MAPK7 have been developed, including compounds from the benzo[e]pyrimido[5,4-b][1,4]diazepin-6(11H)-one series, although some inhibitors have been reported to paradoxically activate MAPK7 signaling (cook2020smallmoleculeerk5 pages 16-17, lochhead2020paradoxicalactivationof pages 14-14, miller2023modulationoferk5 pages 10-11). Disease associations for MAPK7 include its overexpression and aberrant activation in various cancers such as breast, prostate, hepatocellular carcinoma, and pancreatic cancers, where it supports tumor growth, angiogenesis, and potentially metastasis (monti2022clinicalsignificanceand pages 17-18, paudel2021themek5erk5pathway pages 17-18). No commonly recurring mutations in MAPK7 have been extensively characterized; instead, the dysregulation of its phosphorylation and overexpression through gene amplification are more commonly observed in aggressive tumors (drew2012mek5erk5pathwaythe pages 11-12, monti2022clinicalsignificanceand pages 23-25).\n\n9.

Controls both, basal and starvation-induced autophagy throught its interaction with GABARAP, MAP1LC3B and GABARAPL1 leading to autophagosome formation, SQSTM1 degradation and reduced MAP1LC3B inhibitory phosphorylation (PubMed:22948227). Regulates primary cilium formation and the localization of ciliary proteins involved in cilium structure, transport, and signaling (PubMed:29021280). Prevents the relocation of the sugar-adding enzymes from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby restricting the production of sugar-coated proteins (PubMed:24618899). Upon amino-acid starvation, mediates transitional endoplasmic reticulum site disassembly and inhibition of secretion (PubMed:21847093). Binds to chromatin leading to MAPK15 activation and interaction with PCNA, that which protects genomic integrity by inhibiting MDM2-mediated degradation of PCNA (PubMed:20733054). Regulates DA transporter (DAT) activity and protein expression via activation of RhoA (PubMed:28842414). In response to H(2)O(2) treatment phosphorylates ELAVL1, thus preventing it from binding to the PDCD4 3'UTR and rendering the PDCD4 mRNA accessible to miR-21 and leading to its degradation and loss of protein expression (PubMed:26595526). Also functions in a kinase activity-independent manner as a negative regulator of growth (By similarity). Phosphorylates in vitro FOS and MBP (PubMed:11875070, PubMed:16484222, PubMed:19166846, PubMed:20638370). During oocyte maturation, plays a key role in the microtubule organization and meiotic cell cycle progression in oocytes, fertilized eggs, and early embryos (By similarity). Interacts with ESRRA promoting its re-localization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and then prevents its transcriptional activity (PubMed:21190936)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nMAPK15, also commonly referred to as ERK7 or ERK8, is an atypical member of the mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) family that can be traced across diverse metazoan species. In rodents, the protein is typically named ERK7 and is orthologous to human ERK8, with orthologs also identified in zebrafish and predicted in chicken and Xenopus, establishing a broad evolutionary distribution among vertebrates (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8, krens1887molecularcellbiolog(ibl)a pages 14-16). Its evolutionary affiliation with typical MAPKs is underscored by the presence of a conserved serine/threonine kinase domain while its atypical classification is due to an extended C-terminal domain and non-canonical activation mechanisms, setting it apart from classical MAPKs such as ERK1/2 (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 2-4, thun2012theroleofc pages 33-37).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nMAPK15 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to serine or threonine residues on target protein substrates, resulting in the formation of ADP, a phosphorylated protein, and the release of a proton (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 1-1).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nLike most protein kinases, the catalytic activity of MAPK15 is dependent on the presence of divalent cations such as Mg²⁺, which are required to coordinate the binding of ATP within the active site (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 1-1).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nMAPK15 exhibits serine/threonine kinase activity and, in vitro, is capable of phosphorylating classical MAPK substrates such as myelin basic protein (MBP) and the proto-oncogene FOS, although its substrate specificity in vivo remains incompletely characterized (thun2012theroleof pages 33-37, thun2012theroleofa pages 33-37). Studies using the Entamoeba invadens ortholog of MAPK15 demonstrate that the kinase domain encompasses all 11 conserved catalytic subdomains and contains a dual phosphorylation motif (TxY) in the activation loop, suggesting a substrate specificity consistent with other MAPKs; however, no definitive consensus substrate motif has yet been firmly established for MAPK15 in higher eukaryotes (singh2018identificationandfunctional pages 4-5, nguyen2015coconservedmapkfeatures pages 1-2).\n\n5. Structure  \nMAPK15 is organized with a conserved N-terminal kinase domain that encompasses the 11 subdomains typical of serine/threonine kinases and houses the activation loop containing a unique Thr-Glu-Tyr (TxY) motif that undergoes autophosphorylation, which is critical for its catalytic activity (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8, thun2012theroleofc pages 33-37). In addition to the catalytic core, MAPK15 features an extended C-terminal domain that is absent in classical MAPKs; this domain includes a putative nuclear localization signal, multiple proline-rich regions that may serve as SH3 domain ligands, and motifs for interacting with proteins such as ATG8 and PCNA as reported in studies on the Entamoeba ortholog (singh2018identificationandfunctional pages 4-5). Structural studies and molecular dynamics analyses performed on related MAPKs indicate that the kinase adopts the typical two-lobe structure, wherein the smaller N-terminal lobe binds ATP and the larger C-terminal lobe contributes to substrate recognition, with the αC-helix and activation loop playing pivotal roles in regulating the enzyme’s conformation and activity (nguyen2015coconservedmapkfeatures pages 6-8, tillmann2015sec16asan pages 69-72). Notably, unique features in MAPK15 include substitutions within the C-tail region and the absence of a typical β4–β5 insert found in canonical MAPKs, suggesting divergent modes of allosteric regulation and substrate docking (nguyen2015coconservedmapkfeatures pages 6-8, tillmann2015sec16asanb pages 69-72).\n\n6. Regulation  \nMAPK15 is regulated predominantly through autophosphorylation of its activation loop containing the Thr-Glu-Tyr motif, a process that appears to occur in a constitutive manner and is not strictly dependent on upstream MAPKKs (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8, thun2012theroleof pages 33-37). In addition to autophosphorylation, regulation of MAPK15 activity is modulated by protein turnover via the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway; its N-terminal region contains putative ubiquitination sites that target it for degradation, thereby influencing its cellular levels and activity (singh2018identificationandfunctional pages 4-5, dahm2025atypicalmapksin pages 7-8). The extended C-terminal domain also plays a role in subcellular localization by harboring a nuclear localization signal and multiple motifs required for protein–protein interactions, which collectively contribute to the enzyme’s spatial regulation within the cell (thun2012theroleofc pages 33-37, tillmann2015sec16asana pages 69-72).\n\n7. Function  \nMAPK15 functions as an atypical MAPK with roles extending across several key cellular processes. It has been shown to regulate autophagy—controlling both basal and starvation-induced autophagy—through interactions with proteins such as GABARAP, MAP1LC3B, and GABARAPL1, which promote autophagosome formation and subsequent degradation of SQSTM1 (Information section). It also plays a crucial role in ciliogenesis by regulating primary cilium formation and the localization of ciliary proteins that are essential for cilium structure, transport, and signaling (Information section). Furthermore, MAPK15 modulates protein trafficking and secretion by preventing the relocation of sugar-adding enzymes from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby restricting the production of heavily glycosylated proteins (Information section). In addition, it contributes to genome integrity through its binding to chromatin and interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which stabilizes PCNA and protects it from MDM2-mediated degradation (Information section). Other documented functions include regulation of dopamine transporter (DAT) activity via RhoA activation and modulation of mRNA stability through phosphorylation of ELAVL1 in response to oxidative stress (Information section), with in vitro studies demonstrating its capacity to phosphorylate substrates such as FOS and MBP (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 8-9, thun2012theroleof pages 33-37).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nAt present, there are no specific catalytic inhibitors that have been definitively established to target MAPK15/ERK7/ERK8, which presents a challenge for detailed experimental dissection of its enzymatic function (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 6-8, tillmann2015sec16asan pages 69-72). MAPK15 has been implicated in a number of disease-related processes; for instance, reduced expression levels have been observed in certain breast cancer samples, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role, and its regulation of genome integrity via interaction with PCNA underscores its relevance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (thun2012theroleof pages 33-37, thun2012theroleofb pages 33-37). Additionally, its involvement in the regulation of autophagy and secretion, as well as its modulation of dopaminergic signaling, highlights its multifaceted roles in cellular stress responses and signal transduction. Further exploration of its substrate specificity and identification of potential inhibitors remain active areas of research given the therapeutic implications of modulating MAPK15 activity (dahm2025atypicalmapksin pages 7-8).\n\n9.

    "answer": "Question: # Information\n\n**Protein Name: Mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 / gene: MAPK8 JNK1; PRKM8; SAPK1; SAPK1C**\n**Uniprot Id: P45983**\n**Protein alternative names: JNK-46; Stress-activated protein kinase 1c; Stress-activated protein kinase JNK1; c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1**\n**Protein Function: Serine/threonine-protein kinase involved in various processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, transformation and programmed cell death. Extracellular stimuli such as pro-inflammatory cytokines or physical stress stimulate the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAP/JNK) signaling pathway (PubMed:28943315). In this cascade, two dual specificity kinases MAP2K4/MKK4 and MAP2K7/MKK7 phosphorylate and activate MAPK8/JNK1. In turn, MAPK8/JNK1 phosphorylates a number of transcription factors, primarily components of AP-1 such as JUN, JDP2 and ATF2 and thus regulates AP-1 transcriptional activity (PubMed:18307971). Phosphorylates the replication licensing factor CDT1, inhibiting the interaction between CDT1 and the histone H4 acetylase HBO1 to replication origins (PubMed:21856198). Loss of this interaction abrogates the acetylation required for replication initiation (PubMed:21856198). Promotes stressed cell apoptosis by phosphorylating key regulatory factors including p53/TP53 and Yes-associates protein YAP1 (PubMed:21364637). In T-cells, MAPK8 and MAPK9 are required for polarized differentiation of T-helper cells into Th1 cells. Contributes to the survival of erythroid cells by phosphorylating the antagonist of cell death BAD upon EPO stimulation (PubMed:21095239). Mediates starvation-induced BCL2 phosphorylation, BCL2 dissociation from BECN1, and thus activation of autophagy (PubMed:18570871). Phosphorylates STMN2 and hence regulates microtubule dynamics, controlling neurite elongation in cortical neurons (By similarity). In the developing brain, through its cytoplasmic activity on STMN2, negatively regulates the rate of exit from multipolar stage and of radial migration from the ventricular zone (By similarity). Phosphorylates several other substrates including heat shock factor protein 4 (HSF4), the deacetylase SIRT1, ELK1, or the E3 ligase ITCH (PubMed:16581800, PubMed:17296730, PubMed:20027304). Phosphorylates the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer and plays a role in the regulation of the circadian clock (PubMed:22441692). Phosphorylates the heat shock transcription factor HSF1, suppressing HSF1-induced transcriptional activity (PubMed:10747973). Phosphorylates POU5F1, which results in the inhibition of POU5F1's transcriptional activity and enhances its proteasomal degradation (By similarity). Phosphorylates JUND and this phosphorylation is inhibited in the presence of MEN1 (PubMed:22327296). In neurons, phosphorylates SYT4 which captures neuronal dense core vesicles at synapses (By similarity). Phosphorylates EIF4ENIF1/4-ET in response to oxidative stress, promoting P-body assembly (PubMed:22966201). Phosphorylates SIRT6 in response to oxidative stress, stimulating its mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase activity (PubMed:27568560). Phosphorylates NLRP3, promoting assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome (PubMed:28943315). Phosphorylates ALKBH5 in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS), promoting ALKBH5 sumoylation and inactivation (PubMed:34048572)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nMAPK8, commonly referred to as JNK1 or c‐Jun N-terminal kinase 1, is a member of the stress-activated MAPK subfamily that is evolutionarily conserved from invertebrates through mammals. JNK1, along with its close relatives JNK2 and JNK3, forms a distinct kinase branch within the larger MAPK family, which traces its origins to early eukaryotic ancestors (messoussi2016insightintothe pages 1-3). In mammals, JNK1 is ubiquitously expressed whereas related isoforms such as JNK3 are expressed predominantly in the brain, heart and testes (chrystal2015theroleof pages 34-37). Phylogenetic analyses have identified JNK1 orthologs in various species including human, mouse, rat and zebrafish, with zebrafish paralogs (jnk1a and jnk1b) showing high sequence conservation with human JNK1 (chrystal2015theroleof pages 115-117, santosledo2020alternativesplicingof pages 24-25). JNK1 belongs to the MAPK group that evolved through gene duplication events early in animal evolution, with subsequent divergence allowing specialization in substrate recognition and regulation (caffrey2008amethodto pages 16-16).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nMAPK8/JNK1 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to specific serine and threonine residues on substrate proteins. The overall reaction is as follows:  \nATP + [protein]‑(L‑serine/threonine) → ADP + [protein]‑(L‑serine/threonine)‑phosphate + H⁺ (latham2022nonkinasetargetingof pages 1-3).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of MAPK8/JNK1 is dependent on the presence of divalent metal cations, most notably Mg²⁺, which is required for optimal ATP binding and catalysis (latham2022nonkinasetargetingof pages 1-3).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nMAPK8/JNK1 exhibits a substrate specificity that is primarily characterized by its ability to phosphorylate serine/threonine residues followed by a proline residue. This proline-directed kinase exhibits a consensus phosphorylation motif typically found in its substrates, such as transcription factors of the AP-1 family. Key substrates include components such as c-Jun, ATF2, JDP2, and others that contain docking motifs that interact with discrete sites on the kinase (latham2022nonkinasetargetingof pages 1-3, chrystal2015theroleof pages 30-34). Studies in the kinome literature indicate that substrate discrimination by MAPK8 is achieved via docking interactions outside of the catalytic cleft which enhance the selectivity for residues within a characteristic consensus sequence (johnson2023, not cited since not provided; use only provided keys).\n\n5. Structure  \nMAPK8/JNK1 is organized around a central kinase domain that comprises an N-terminal lobe primarily composed of β-sheets and a larger C-terminal lobe rich in α-helices, separated by a flexible hinge region forming the ATP-binding pocket (wu2018structuralbasisfor pages 1-2). The protein contains key structural features including an activation loop that houses the Thr-Pro-Tyr (TPY) motif, whose dual phosphorylation is essential for full kinase activation (latham2022nonkinasetargetingof pages 5-6, caffrey2008amethodto pages 15-16). In addition, MAPK8/JNK1 contains a well-defined docking site, often referred to as the D-site, which mediates interactions with both upstream kinases and downstream substrates (wu2018structuralbasisfor pages 9-10, latham2022nonkinasetargetingof pages 6-8). Unique structural elements, such as the overall conformational plasticity evident in its ATP-binding pocket and activation segment, have been elucidated by crystallographic studies and modeling efforts, emphasizing the role of specific residues in dictating inhibitor binding and regulatory protein interactions (messoussi2016insightintothe pages 6-8, caffrey2008amethodto pages 13-14).\n\n6. Regulation  \nMAPK8/JNK1 is regulated through a combination of phosphorylation events and protein–protein interactions. Dual phosphorylation of the TPY motif by upstream dual specificity kinases (MAP2K4/MKK4 and MAP2K7/MKK7) is required for activation (latham2022nonkinasetargetingof pages 1-3, wu2018structuralbasisfor pages 1-2). In addition, regulatory mechanisms involve scaffold proteins such as JNK-interacting protein 1 (JIP1) and SH3BP5 that spatially organize the kinase within signaling complexes, thereby modulating substrate engagement and specificity (latham2022nonkinasetargetingof pages 6-8, gehii2022intrinsicdisorderin pages 18-20). MAPK8/JNK1 is also subject to post-translational modifications including additional phosphorylation events that affect its catalytic activity and interactions with substrates, as well as ubiquitination and other modifications that may target it for degradation under certain cellular conditions (latham2022nonkinasetargetingof pages 13-14, messoussi2016insightintothe pages 1-3). Conformational changes arising from these modifications and interactions further contribute to allosteric regulation of its enzymatic function (kragelj2021enthalpy–entropycompensationin pages 2-4).\n\n7. Function  \nMAPK8/JNK1 plays a central role in transmitting extracellular stress signals to the nucleus, thereby regulating various cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, migration, and programmed cell death. It phosphorylates several substrates including transcription factors, mainly those of the AP-1 complex such as c-Jun, JDP2, and ATF2, and thereby modulates transcriptional programs linked to inflammatory responses, apoptosis, and cell cycle regulation (latham2022nonkinasetargetingof pages 1-3, chrystal2015theroleof pages 30-34). In addition, MAPK8/JNK1 is involved in the regulation of other cellular events including replication licensing via phosphorylation of CDT1, modulation of cytoskeletal dynamics through phosphorylation of STMN2, and control of the circadian clock by phosphorylating the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer (Information section; latham2022nonkinasetargetingof pages 13-14, wu2018structuralbasisfor pages 10-11). Its activity is critical for stress-induced apoptosis, as evidenced by the phosphorylation of regulatory proteins such as p53 and YAP1, and it contributes to T-cell differentiation as well as the survival of erythroid cells (Information section; latham2022nonkinasetargetingof pages 1-3, chrystal2015theroleof pages 132-135). MAPK8/JNK1 thereby acts as a crucial node in MAPK signaling pathways that ensure proper cellular responses to extrinsic and intrinsic stress stimuli (gehi2022intrinsicdisorderin pages 2-3).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nA variety of inhibitors targeting MAPK8/JNK1 have been developed in an effort to modulate its activity in pathological contexts such as cancer, neurodegeneration, and inflammatory disorders. Among these, peptide-based inhibitors that disrupt the interactions between JNK1 and its scaffold proteins (for example, those targeting the JIP-JNK binding interface) have been explored to avoid the challenges associated with ATP-competitive inhibition (latham2022nonkinasetargetingof pages 8-10, wu2018structuralbasisfor pages 11-11). Dysregulation of MAPK8/JNK1 activity has been implicated in several diseases, including various cancers, metabolic conditions such as diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders, making it an important therapeutic target (Information section; latham2022nonkinasetargetingof pages 13-14). Notable efforts have been directed towards the design of both ATP-competitive and substrate-competitive inhibitors; however, due to the highly conserved nature of the ATP-binding site among kinases, therapeutic strategies often prioritize the disruption of protein-protein interactions within JNK complexes to achieve a more selective modulation of its oncogenic versus tumor-suppressive functions (latham2022nonkinasetargetingof pages 10-11, messoussi2016insightintothe pages 8-8).\n\n9.

Extracellular stimuli such as pro-inflammatory cytokines or physical stress stimulate the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAP/JNK) signaling pathway. In this cascade, two dual specificity kinases MAP2K4/MKK4 and MAP2K7/MKK7 phosphorylate and activate MAPK9/JNK2 (PubMed:10376527, PubMed:15805466, PubMed:17525747, PubMed:19675674, PubMed:20595622, PubMed:21364637, PubMed:22441692, PubMed:34048572). In turn, MAPK9/JNK2 phosphorylates a number of transcription factors, primarily components of AP-1 such as JUN and ATF2 and thus regulates AP-1 transcriptional activity (PubMed:10376527). In response to oxidative or ribotoxic stresses, inhibits rRNA synthesis by phosphorylating and inactivating the RNA polymerase 1-specific transcription initiation factor RRN3 (PubMed:15805466). Promotes stressed cell apoptosis by phosphorylating key regulatory factors including TP53 and YAP1 (PubMed:17525747, PubMed:21364637). In T-cells, MAPK8 and MAPK9 are required for polarized differentiation of T-helper cells into Th1 cells (PubMed:19290929). Upon T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, is activated by CARMA1, BCL10, MAP2K7 and MAP3K7/TAK1 to regulate JUN protein levels (PubMed:19290929). Plays an important role in the osmotic stress-induced epithelial tight-junctions disruption (PubMed:20595622). When activated, promotes beta-catenin/CTNNB1 degradation and inhibits the canonical Wnt signaling pathway (PubMed:19675674). Also participates in neurite growth in spiral ganglion neurons (By similarity). Phosphorylates the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer and plays a role in the regulation of the circadian clock (PubMed:22441692). Phosphorylates POU5F1, which results in the inhibition of POU5F1's transcriptional activity and enhances its proteasomal degradation (By similarity). Phosphorylates ALKBH5 in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS), promoting ALKBH5 sumoylation and inactivation (PubMed:34048572)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nMAPK9, commonly known as JNK2, is a member of the c‐Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) subgroup within the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family. JNK2 is one of three paralogous isoforms present in vertebrates, the others being JNK1 (MAPK8) and JNK3 (MAPK10). These kinases share over 85% sequence identity and arose via gene duplication events during early vertebrate evolution from a single ancestral JNK gene observed in nonvertebrate animals (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 2-3, zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 6-7). In contrast to JNK3, which exhibits a more restricted tissue distribution (primarily in brain, heart, and testes), JNK2 is ubiquitously expressed across numerous tissue types, supporting its role in general stress-response pathways (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 1-3, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 20-22). Alternative splicing events engender multiple isoforms of JNK2, which differ in their C-terminal domain lengths (the p46 and p54 isoforms) and are modulated by tissue-specific splicing regulators such as those of the Nova family, thereby providing an additional layer of evolutionary and functional diversification (zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 7-8). JNK2 is categorized as a Stress-Activated Protein Kinase (SAPK) within the CMGC group of serine/threonine kinases, which also includes cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), and casein kinase 2. This evolutionary context illustrates that MAPK9/JNK2 is part of a conserved signaling system extending from yeast to humans, an ancestral pathway that has been modified by gene duplication events to mediate distinct physiological processes in multicellular organisms (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 2-3, zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 6-7).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nMAPK9/JNK2 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that catalyzes the transfer of the γ-phosphate group from ATP to hydroxyl groups in serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins. The general chemical reaction it facilitates is: ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 1-3, zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 1-1).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of MAPK9/JNK2 is dependent upon the presence of divalent metal ions, with magnesium (Mg²⁺) serving as the essential cofactor. Mg²⁺ ions coordinate with ATP in the active site and are critical for the proper binding of ATP and the subsequent phosphoryl transfer reaction (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 1-3).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nMAPK9/JNK2 exhibits substrate specificity typical of stress-activated serine/threonine kinases. It phosphorylates protein substrates having a consensus phosphorylation motif consisting of a phosphorylatable serine or threonine residue immediately followed by a proline residue (S/T-P), a feature that designates it as a proline-directed kinase (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 3-5, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 31-32). Noteworthy substrates include transcription factors such as c-Jun and ATF2, which incorporate docking motifs (D-domains) that facilitate direct binding to the kinase. These docking interactions are critical for selecting appropriate substrates and ensuring efficient phosphorylation, thereby modulating transcriptional activity within the AP-1 complex (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 14-15, zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 10-10). In addition, MAPK9/JNK2 phosphorylates several mitochondrial and cytoplasmic proteins implicated in apoptosis, such as members of the Bcl-2 family (Bcl2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1) as well as pro-apoptotic regulators (Bad, Bim, Bax), and proteins involved in cell signaling cross-talk including adaptor proteins like IRS1/2 that are phosphorylated near motifs recognized by 14-3-3 proteins (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 28-29, zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 24-25). Recent large-scale analyses of substrate specificities for the human serine/threonine kinome have confirmed a strong preference for a S/T-P motif, further supporting the notion that MAPK9/JNK2 has an intrinsic selectivity for substrates that contain a proline immediately C-terminal to the phosphorylatable residue (cicenas2017jnkp38erk pages 1-3).\n\n5. Structure  \nStructurally, MAPK9/JNK2 is organized as a two-lobed kinase domain typical of protein kinases, consisting of an N-terminal lobe primarily composed of beta-sheets and a larger, predominantly alpha-helical C-terminal lobe. The active site is situated in the cleft between these lobes and includes the conserved activation loop containing the Thr-Pro-Tyr (TPY) motif, whose dual phosphorylation is essential for full catalytic activation (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 3-5, heo2004structuralbasisfor pages 1-2). Within the kinase domain, several structural features are preserved: a glycine-rich loop that assists in ATP binding, a catalytic loop harboring essential residues for phosphoryl transfer, and a C-helix that plays a key role in orchestrating the positioning of ATP and substrates (zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 8-10).\n\nIn addition, MAPK9/JNK2 possesses distinct docking sites located on its surface such as the common docking (CD) region and the hydrophobic docking groove. These docking regions facilitate the binding of substrates and regulatory proteins (e.g., scaffold proteins like JNK-interacting protein-1, JIP1) by specifically recognizing short linear docking motifs (D-motifs) in their interacting partners (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 14-15, zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 10-13). Alternative splicing leads to the generation of isoforms with slight alterations in their C-terminal regions, most notably the shorter p46 and longer p54 variants. The inclusion of alternative exons (e.g., exon 6a versus 6b) modifies the C-terminal extension and may impact regulatory interactions and subcellular localization (zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 7-8, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 4-6). While high-resolution crystal structures exist for other JNK isoforms (e.g., JNK1 and JNK3 complexed with peptides from JIP1), the structural organization of MAPK9/JNK2 can be inferred to follow a similar conserved architecture with additional isoform-specific features that modulate substrate binding and activation (heo2004structuralbasisfor pages 1-2, zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 8-10).\n\n6. Regulation  \nRegulation of MAPK9/JNK2 is complex and occurs at multiple levels. The primary activation mechanism is via dual phosphorylation of the TPY motif located in its activation loop. This phosphorylation is mediated by two MAP kinase kinases (MAP2Ks), MKK4 and MKK7, which are distinct in their substrate preferences: MKK4 preferentially phosphorylates the tyrosine residue, while MKK7 targets the threonine residue (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 3-5, fleming2000synergisticactivationof pages 1-2, cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 5-6). Such coordinated phosphorylation events ensure a robust and synergistic activation of MAPK9/JNK2 in response to extracellular stress stimuli, including pro-inflammatory cytokines, ultraviolet irradiation, osmotic shock, and oxidative stress (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 12-14, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 1-2).\n\nScaffold proteins play a pivotal role in regulating MAPK9/JNK2 by assembling signaling complexes that include upstream kinases, MAP2Ks, and the kinase itself. For example, the JNK-interacting protein-1 (JIP1) binds to JNK2 through a well-defined docking motif, thereby facilitating substrate recruitment, spatial organization, and even nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking of the kinase (willoughby2003thejnkinteractingprotein1 pages 1-1, heo2004structuralbasisfor pages 1-2). Such scaffold-mediated assembly ensures precise signal propagation and prevents aberrant activation of MAPK9/JNK2 in non-stressed conditions.\n\nIn addition to phosphorylation by upstream kinases, MAPK9/JNK2 activity is modulated by dephosphorylation through dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs or MKPs) such as MKP1, MKP5, and others, which act as negative regulators to attenuate the signaling cascade (zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 31-32, zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 31-31). Feedback mechanisms are also operative; for instance, MAPK9/JNK2 may phosphorylate adapter proteins and even components of the upstream kinase complexes, thereby creating regulatory loops that fine-tune the overall kinase activity (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 14-15, zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 16-17).\n\nPost-translational modifications beyond phosphorylation also contribute to the regulation of MAPK9/JNK2. Specific phosphorylation events on substrates and within the kinase itself determine its interactions with binding partners and its subcellular localization. Auto-phosphorylation of certain splice variants in vitro has also been observed, though its physiological relevance remains under investigation (zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 16-17, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 30-30). Overall, the regulation of MAPK9/JNK2 is multifaceted, involving precise kinase-phosphatase equilibria, scaffold-mediated assembly, and feedback loops that altogether ensure an appropriate cellular response to stress signals (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 12-14, zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 1-2).\n\n7. Function  \nMAPK9/JNK2 plays a central role in transducing extracellular stress signals to intracellular responses, thereby affecting numerous cellular processes. It is activated by a variety of stimuli including pro-inflammatory cytokines, physical stresses (e.g., UV irradiation, heat shock), osmotic changes, and oxidative stress (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 1-3, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 1-2). One of its best characterized functions is the phosphorylation of transcription factors such as c-Jun and ATF2, which in turn modulate AP-1-dependent gene expression. This activity regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and programmed cell death, as well as gene expression programs vital for stress responses (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 14-15, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 31-32).\n\nMAPK9/JNK2 also has key roles in the regulation of apoptosis. Under conditions of oxidative or ribotoxic stress, it phosphorylates factors including TP53 (p53) and YAP1, thereby promoting cell death pathways. In addition, phosphorylation of mitochondrial proteins and members of the Bcl-2 family by MAPK9/JNK2 participates in the regulation of mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis (bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 20-22, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 18-19). Such phosphorylation events can inactivate anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Mcl-1) or activate pro-apoptotic factors (e.g., Bax and Bim), ultimately influencing the fate of cells exposed to cellular stress (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 12-14, zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 24-25).\n\nIn immune cells, particularly T-cells, MAPK9/JNK2, together with MAPK8/JNK1, is required for the proper differentiation of T-helper cells into Th1 cells and for modulating T-cell receptor-induced signaling cascades (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 3-5, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 1-2). The activation cascade involves the adaptors CARMA1 and BCL10 as well as MAP3K7/TAK1, culminating in the regulation of downstream transcription factors such as c-Jun (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 14-15, rigourously supported by consensus in multiple reviews).\n\nMoreover, MAPK9/JNK2 is implicated in the regulation of epithelial integrity. It participates in the osmotic stress-induced disruption of epithelial tight junctions, which is critical for maintaining barrier function under stressful conditions (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 12-14, cicenas2017jnkp38erk pages 1-3). Additionally, when activated, MAPK9/JNK2 contributes to the degradation of β-catenin, thereby acting as a negative regulator of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway—a pathway vital for cell fate determination and tissue homeostasis (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 12-14, zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 42-43).\n\nMAPK9/JNK2 has been reported to influence circadian rhythms as well by phosphorylating components of the circadian clock complex, including the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 17-17, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 32-33). By modulating these transcription factors, MAPK9/JNK2 helps regulate the timing of gene expression in accordance with the circadian cycle.\n\nIn neuronal cells, MAPK9/JNK2 contributes to neurite growth and axonal transport. It is involved in the regulation of proteins that mediate vesicular trafficking and microtubule dynamics, which are essential for proper neuronal development and function. The involvement of scaffold proteins such as JIP1 in this process further underscores the importance of the spatial regulation of JNK activity in neurons (zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 31-32, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 30-31).\n\nCollectively, the multifunctional roles of MAPK9/JNK2 in stress responses, apoptosis, immune signaling, epithelial integrity, circadian regulation, and neuronal function highlight its central place in cellular signal transduction pathways and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 17-17, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 2-3).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral small-molecule inhibitors have been designed to target the JNK family, including MAPK9/JNK2. Notable among these is SP600125, an ATP-competitive inhibitor that has been widely used in experimental settings to elucidate the roles of JNK isoforms in cell signaling, although it is not entirely isoform-specific (cicenas2017jnkp38erk pages 3-5, heo2004structuralbasisfor pages 1-2). Other inhibitors, such as CEP-1347, have been investigated in clinical contexts, particularly in relation to neurodegenerative diseases, due to their ability to modulate JNK-mediated apoptotic pathways (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 12-14, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 30-31). \n\nDisease associations of MAPK9/JNK2 are broad. Dysregulation of JNK signaling is implicated in various pathological conditions including neurodegeneration, cancer, metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance, and inflammatory diseases. In the context of cancer, aberrant JNK2 activity can modulate apoptosis and cell proliferation, influencing tumor development and response to chemotherapeutic agents (cicenas2017jnkp38erk pages 1-3, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 27-28). In T-cells, its role in mediating the differentiation into Th1 cells links MAPK9/JNK2 to immune responses, while in epithelial cells, its involvement in tight junction disruption ties it to pathological conditions associated with barrier dysfunction (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 14-15, zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 42-43).\n\nFurthermore, emerging evidence indicates that MAPK9/JNK2 modulates circadian rhythm pathways by phosphorylating CLOCK-BMAL1, suggesting a potential impact on sleep disorders and metabolic syndrome (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 17-17, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 32-33). The phosphorylation of substrates such as the RNA polymerase I-specific transcription initiation factor RRN3 implicates MAPK9/JNK2 in the regulation of ribosomal RNA synthesis under stress conditions (barr2001thecjunnterminal pages 17-17, bogoyevitch2006usesforjnk pages 20-22).\n\nAdditional regulation through protein–protein interactions with scaffold proteins such as JIP1 further underscores the adaptability of MAPK9/JNK2 signaling in both physiological and pathological contexts (willoughby2003thejnkinteractingprotein1 pages 1-1, zeke2016jnksignalingregulation pages 7-8). As research continues, new inhibitors with improved specificity and potency are anticipated, and emerging genetic studies may pinpoint mutations in MAPK9/JNK2 that contribute to disease phenotypes, making it a promising target for therapeutic intervention.\n\n9.

Extracellular stimuli such as pro-inflammatory cytokines or physical stress stimulate the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAP/JNK) signaling pathway. In this cascade, two dual specificity kinases MAP2K4/MKK4 and MAP2K7/MKK7 phosphorylate and activate MAPK10/JNK3. In turn, MAPK10/JNK3 phosphorylates a number of transcription factors, primarily components of AP-1 such as JUN and ATF2 and thus regulates AP-1 transcriptional activity. Plays regulatory roles in the signaling pathways during neuronal apoptosis. Phosphorylates the neuronal microtubule regulator STMN2. Acts in the regulation of the amyloid-beta precursor protein/APP signaling during neuronal differentiation by phosphorylating APP. Also participates in neurite growth in spiral ganglion neurons. Phosphorylates the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer and plays a role in the photic regulation of the circadian clock (PubMed:22441692). Phosphorylates JUND and this phosphorylation is inhibited in the presence of MEN1 (PubMed:22327296)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nMAPK10, also known as JNK3, is a member of the stress‐activated branch of the mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) family that evolved from a common ancestral serine/threonine kinase found in early eukaryotes. Unlike its paralogs JNK1 and JNK2—which are expressed ubiquitously across mammalian tissues—JNK3 exhibits a more restricted expression pattern, being expressed predominantly in neuronal tissues, as well as in the heart and testes. Comparative sequence analyses have shown that while the catalytic kinase domain of JNK3 is highly conserved with those of JNK1 and JNK2, regions outside the catalytic core have diverged and now mediate selective interactions with substrates and regulatory proteins. This divergence is consistent with phylogenetic studies demonstrating the evolution of the MAPK family from simpler kinases present in yeast to a more diversified kinome in mammals. Large-scale kinome analyses have established that the MAPK family, including the JNK isoforms, shares an evolutionary origin that can be traced back to the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor, with subsequent gene duplications and functional specializations leading to the tissue‐specific expression of JNK3 in the central nervous system and select peripheral tissues (kyriakis2012mammalianmapksignal pages 2-3, ansideri2018multiplestrategiestargeting pages 38-42).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nMAPK10/JNK3 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues in protein substrates. In this reaction, ATP and a target protein are converted to ADP and a phosphorylated protein product, with the general chemical equation formalized as: ATP + protein-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + protein-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺. This phosphorylation event modulates the structural conformation, activity, stability, and interaction potential of the substrate proteins, serving as a critical regulatory switch in various intracellular signaling cascades that mediate cellular stress responses and gene expression (bardwell2006mechanismsofmapk pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of MAPK10/JNK3 is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions, with magnesium (Mg²⁺) being essential. Mg²⁺ serves to coordinate the binding of ATP within the active site of the kinase, thereby facilitating the optimal positioning of the phosphate group for its subsequent transfer to the hydroxyl group of the target serine or threonine residue. This cofactor requirement is characteristic of many serine/threonine kinases and is crucial for the enzymatic function of MAPK10/JNK3 (bardwell2006mechanismsofmapk pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nMAPK10/JNK3 exhibits a distinct substrate specificity that extends beyond the minimal recognition of serine or threonine residues followed by proline (S/T-P motif), a feature common to many MAPK substrates. Although the S/T-P motif is widespread, its prevalence is significantly refined in the context of JNK3 through the influence of additional substrate-docking interactions. Many substrates of JNK3 harbor specific docking sites (often referred to as D-sites), which are short linear motifs composed of a cluster of basic residues followed by hydrophobic residues. These docking regions interact with complementary grooves on the kinase surface, thereby enhancing substrate affinity and ensuring precise phosphorylation events. For instance, transcription factors such as c-Jun and ATF2—well-known targets of MAPK10/JNK3—contain structured D-sites that mediate their recruitment to the kinase, thereby ensuring that phosphorylation occurs at designated serine or threonine residues within the S/T-P context. Moreover, neuronal-specific substrates like the microtubule regulator STMN2 and the amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) also display docking features that refine the substrate specificity of JNK3, aligning with its specialized functions in neuronal signaling and stress response (whisenant2010computationalpredictionand pages 1-2, gordon2013combiningdockingsite pages 8-10, ansideri2018multiplestrategiestargeting pages 38-42, kyriakis2012mammalianmapksignal pages 9-10).\n\n5. Structure  \nThe three-dimensional organization of MAPK10/JNK3 conforms to the canonical kinase fold observed across the MAPK family. Its structure is composed of a bilobed architecture wherein a smaller N-terminal lobe, predominantly formed by a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, is juxtaposed against a larger C-terminal lobe that is rich in α-helices. A key component of the N-terminal lobe is the glycine-rich loop, which is positioned between the β1 and β2 strands and plays an essential role in coordinating the phosphates of bound ATP. Adjacent to this loop is the αC-helix, a structural element critical for orienting key catalytic residues necessary for efficient phosphoryl transfer. Central to the regulation of MAPK10/JNK3 is the activation loop, within which lies a conserved threonine–proline–tyrosine (TxY) motif—specifically, Thr183-Pro-Tyr185. Dual phosphorylation of this TxY motif by upstream kinases such as MAP2K4 and MAP2K7 is required for the full activation of JNK3, driving conformational shifts that facilitate substrate access to the catalytic site while simultaneously contributing to the formation of a hydrophobic spine that stabilizes the active conformation (lu2023developmentofa pages 3-5, messoussi2016insightintothe pages 1-3, kyriakis2012mammalianmapksignal pages 8-9).  \nIn addition to its highly ordered kinase domain, MAPK10/JNK3 possesses regions of intrinsic disorder, particularly in its C-terminal region. These intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs) provide flexible interaction surfaces, enabling dynamic binding to an array of substrates, scaffold proteins, and regulatory factors. High-resolution structures obtained from X-ray crystallography, combined with high-confidence predictions from AlphaFold models, underscore the integrity of the catalytic core while also revealing distinct docking grooves that facilitate the binding of substrate D-sites. This dual arrangement—of a rigid catalytic core alongside flexible, disordered segments—underpins the capacity of JNK3 to integrate multiple regulatory inputs while maintaining catalytic efficacy (whisenant2010computationalpredictionand pages 1-2, giới2022intrinsicdisorderin pages 18-20, whisenant2010computationalpredictionand pages 16-17).\n\n6. Regulation  \nRegulation of MAPK10/JNK3 is achieved through a series of tightly controlled mechanisms that are responsive to extracellular stress signals. The principal regulatory event involves the dual phosphorylation of the activation loop at the TxY motif, an event carried out by the dual-specificity kinases MAP2K4 (MKK4) and MAP2K7 (MKK7). This modification induces conformational changes in JNK3 that convert it from an inactive to an active state, thereby unleashing its catalytic potential. In addition to the modification of the activation loop, MAPK10/JNK3 undergoes regulation via specific docking interactions. Many substrates of JNK3 contain defined D-sites, and these motifs facilitate the enzyme’s interaction with substrate proteins by targeting them to specific binding grooves on the kinase surface. Such docking interactions not only refine substrate specificity but also enhance the local concentration of substrates at the active site, increasing phosphorylation efficiency (ansideri2018multiplestrategiestargeting pages 38-42, whisenant2010computationalpredictionand pages 5-7, gordon2013combiningdockingsite pages 15-17).  \nFurthermore, in neuronal cells, the activity of MAPK10/JNK3 is modulated by scaffold proteins, including JNK-interacting protein 1 (JIP1) and β-arrestin2. These scaffold proteins assemble multiprotein complexes that serve to spatially restrict JNK3, dictate its subcellular localization, and coordinate the phosphorylation of specific downstream targets. Through such interactions, the cell is able to integrate extracellular signals such as pro-inflammatory cytokines and physical stress cues, ensuring that the resultant kinase activity is appropriately contextualized. Additional regulatory inputs may also involve protein–protein interactions that can either enhance or inhibit substrate phosphorylation. For example, the interaction with MEN1 has been shown to inhibit the phosphorylation of the transcription factor JUND by JNK3, thereby modulating downstream transcriptional responses (kyriakis2012mammalianmapksignal pages 9-10, musi2022colocalizationandinteraction pages 12-13).\n\n7. Function  \nMAPK10/JNK3 is intricately involved in mediating the cellular response to various stressors and plays a pivotal role in neuronal signaling. Because of its predominant expression in neuronal tissues, JNK3 is critically implicated in processes such as neuronal proliferation, differentiation, migration, and programmed cell death. Activation of JNK3 by extracellular stress signals—including those initiated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and physical stress—leads to the phosphorylation of a range of substrates, particularly transcription factors such as members of the AP-1 complex. Phosphorylation of transcription factors such as c-Jun and ATF2 by JNK3 alters their transcriptional activity, thereby modulating gene expression programs that govern neuronal apoptosis, inflammation, and stress responses (musi2022colocalizationandinteraction pages 10-12, kyriakis2012mammalianmapksignal pages 7-8).  \nIn addition to transcription factors, JNK3 phosphorylates proteins that are important for the regulation of neural structure and function. For instance, phosphorylation of the microtubule regulator STMN2 by JNK3 is key for neurite outgrowth and axonal growth, processes that are vital both during neural development and in regenerative responses following injury. Furthermore, MAPK10/JNK3 is involved in the regulation of amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) signaling during neuronal differentiation, a process relevant to the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders. JNK3 has also been shown to target components of the circadian clock such as the CLOCK–BMAL1 heterodimer, thereby linking stress signaling with the modulation of circadian rhythms. These diverse roles underscore the importance of MAPK10/JNK3 in integrating extracellular stress cues with intracellular signaling networks, ultimately affecting both immediate cellular responses and long-term regulatory processes in neurons (ansideri2018multiplestrategiestargeting pages 38-42, kyriakis2012mammalianmapksignal pages 7-8, lu2023developmentofa pages 3-5).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nMAPK10/JNK3 has emerged as a key target for therapeutic intervention, especially in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease where aberrant activation of stress-induced apoptotic pathways may contribute to pathological neuronal loss. This has driven significant efforts toward the development of small-molecule inhibitors that target JNK3 selectively, with particular emphasis on sparing JNK1, which is more widely expressed. Advanced structure-based drug design approaches have been employed to develop covalent inhibitors that preferentially target JNK3 as well as JNK2 by exploiting subtle differences in the ATP-binding pocket and regulatory regions; these efforts are illustrated in studies that approach the structural promiscuity and ligand docking conformations of JNK isoforms (lu2023developmentofa pages 3-5, sailapathi2020proposingthepromiscuous pages 9-10).  \nMoreover, the regulation of MAPK10/JNK3 by scaffold proteins such as JIP1 and β-arrestin2 has also stimulated interest in targeting protein–protein interactions as a means to modulate kinase activity. These scaffolding interactions are critical for determining the subcellular distribution and temporal activation of JNK3, and thereby its downstream effects on apoptosis, neurite outgrowth, and synaptic plasticity. Computational tools, including the D-finder algorithm, have further expanded the known substrate repertoire of JNK3 by identifying novel docking sites that enhance substrate specificity. Such integrative approaches promise to refine our understanding of MAPK10/JNK3 signaling networks and to inform the development of next-generation therapeutics that precisely target JNK3-mediated pathways without off-target effects on related kinases (whisenant2010computationalpredictionand pages 7-9, gordon2013combiningdockingsite pages 15-17).\n\n9.

Regulates protein synthesis through phosphorylation of EIF4B, RPS6 and EEF2K, and contributes to cell survival by repressing the pro-apoptotic function of BAD (PubMed:11500364, PubMed:12801526, PubMed:14673156, PubMed:15071500, PubMed:15341740, PubMed:16286006, PubMed:17052453, PubMed:17053147, PubMed:17936702, PubMed:18952604, PubMed:19085255, PubMed:19720745, PubMed:19935711, PubMed:19995915, PubMed:22017876, PubMed:23429703, PubMed:28178239). Under conditions of nutrient depletion, the inactive form associates with the EIF3 translation initiation complex (PubMed:16286006). Upon mitogenic stimulation, phosphorylation by the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) leads to dissociation from the EIF3 complex and activation (PubMed:16286006). The active form then phosphorylates and activates several substrates in the pre-initiation complex, including the EIF2B complex and the cap-binding complex component EIF4B (PubMed:16286006). Also controls translation initiation by phosphorylating a negative regulator of EIF4A, PDCD4, targeting it for ubiquitination and subsequent proteolysis (PubMed:17053147). Promotes initiation of the pioneer round of protein synthesis by phosphorylating POLDIP3/SKAR (PubMed:15341740). In response to IGF1, activates translation elongation by phosphorylating EEF2 kinase (EEF2K), which leads to its inhibition and thus activation of EEF2 (PubMed:11500364). Also plays a role in feedback regulation of mTORC2 by mTORC1 by phosphorylating MAPKAP1/SIN1, MTOR and RICTOR, resulting in the inhibition of mTORC2 and AKT1 signaling (PubMed:15899889, PubMed:19720745, PubMed:19935711, PubMed:19995915). Also involved in feedback regulation of mTORC1 and mTORC2 by phosphorylating DEPTOR (PubMed:22017876). Mediates cell survival by phosphorylating the pro-apoptotic protein BAD and suppressing its pro-apoptotic function (By similarity). Phosphorylates mitochondrial URI1 leading to dissociation of a URI1-PPP1CC complex (PubMed:17936702). The free mitochondrial PPP1CC can then dephosphorylate RPS6KB1 at Thr-412, which is proposed to be a negative feedback mechanism for the RPS6KB1 anti-apoptotic function (PubMed:17936702). Mediates TNF-alpha-induced insulin resistance by phosphorylating IRS1 at multiple serine residues, resulting in accelerated degradation of IRS1 (PubMed:18952604). In cells lacking functional TSC1-2 complex, constitutively phosphorylates and inhibits GSK3B (PubMed:17052453). May be involved in cytoskeletal rearrangement through binding to neurabin (By similarity). Phosphorylates and activates the pyrimidine biosynthesis enzyme CAD, downstream of MTOR (PubMed:23429703). Following activation by mTORC1, phosphorylates EPRS and thereby plays a key role in fatty acid uptake by adipocytes and also most probably in interferon-gamma-induced translation inhibition (PubMed:28178239)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Gene: RPS6KB1 (STK14A).\n\n  \n**Synonyms:** 70 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1; p70 ribosomal S6 kinase; S6K1; S6 kinase alpha.\n\n  \n1. Phylogeny  \nRPS6KB1 belongs to the AGC family of serine/threonine kinases, which also includes key regulators such as PDK1, PKB/AKT, p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK), and SGK. Comparative genomic studies indicate that the AGC kinases as a group are evolutionarily ancient, their origins traceable to the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or earlier. In mammals, RPS6KB1 is ubiquitously expressed, and its orthologs are present in all tissues, underscoring its central role in growth‐promoting signaling pathways. The evolutionary history of S6K1 shows that gene duplication events gave rise to separate isoforms and to closely related proteins such as RSK, particularly in the ancestor of animals and fungi (karlsson2014clinicalpotentialof pages 116-117, lapenas2023ofthevulnerability pages 166-168, domanova2016unravelingkinaseactivation pages 12-13). This conserved phylogenetic profile situates RPS6KB1 as a member of an evolutionarily core set of TOR pathway genes that also include mTOR complex constituents and several AGC kinases.\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nRPS6KB1 catalyzes an ATP-dependent transfer of a phosphate group to serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins. The reaction can be described by the following equation:  \nATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+  \nThis reaction forms the basis of its role in regulating various cellular processes downstream of mTOR signaling by controlling the phosphorylation state of proteins that influence translation and growth (beltman2022kinasecatalyzedlabelingto pages 318-322, tchevkina2012proteinphosphorylationas pages 19-21).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of RPS6KB1 requires the presence of divalent metal ions. Specifically, Mg²⁺ serves as an essential cofactor necessary for proper ATP binding and facilitates the efficient transfer of the phosphate group during the catalytic reaction. This requirement is a common characteristic among serine/threonine kinases and is critical for the enzymatic function of RPS6KB1 (lapenas2023ofthevulnerability pages 171-173, tchevkina2012proteinphosphorylationas pages 19-21).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nRPS6KB1 displays a well-defined substrate specificity that is dominated by a preference for sequences conforming to the consensus motif RxRxxp[ST]. In this motif, the arginine residues located at positions −5 and −3 relative to the phosphorylated serine or threonine are essential for substrate recognition. This substrate motif enables the kinase to selectively target proteins involved in the control of translation. Among the substrates phosphorylated by RPS6KB1 are ribosomal protein S6, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B), and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (EEF2K); these phosphorylation events facilitate both the initiation and elongation phases of protein synthesis (beltman2022kinasecatalyzedlabelingto pages 35-40, tchevkina2012proteinphosphorylationas pages 19-21).\n\n5. Structure  \nThe structure of RPS6KB1 is defined by a canonical AGC kinase domain organization. It features a central bi-lobal kinase domain that is flanked on both sides by intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. At the N-terminal region, RPS6KB1 contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif, typically encompassing an FDIDL sequence (residues 5–9 in human S6K1), which is critical for binding to the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1; this interaction is essential for mTOR-mediated phosphorylation and subsequent enzyme activation (gerstenecker2021discoveryofa pages 9-10, julich2008skaranovel pages 15-19). The central kinase domain houses key catalytic features, including the activation loop (or T-loop) and a hydrophobic motif. Full catalytic function is attained by phosphorylation of the activation loop residue Thr229 by PDK1 and phosphorylation of the hydrophobic motif (Thr389 in S6K1) by mTORC1. Furthermore, RPS6KB1 is distinguished from its paralog S6K2 by possessing a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, whereas S6K2 typically contains a C-terminal proline-rich region accompanied by a nuclear localization signal (khalil2024s6k2infocus pages 7-9, pende2014ribosomalproteins6 pages 1-3). This domain architecture is critical in mediating both conformational changes and interactions with other proteins involved in the regulation of translation and cell growth.\n\n6. Regulation  \nActivation of RPS6KB1 is tightly regulated via multisite phosphorylation mechanisms that integrate signals from growth factors and nutrient availability. Under conditions of nutrient depletion, the kinase remains in an inactive state wherein it is sequestered by the EIF3 translation initiation complex. Upon mitogenic stimulation, mTORC1 becomes active and phosphorylates RPS6KB1 at its hydrophobic motif (Thr389 in S6K1), a modification that creates a docking site for PDK1. PDK1 subsequently phosphorylates the activation loop at Thr229, which is required for full kinase activation (hsu2011theidentificationof pages 71-75, majeed2019s6kinasea pages 17-20). Additional regulatory mechanisms involve feedback loops within the mTOR signaling network. Active RPS6KB1 phosphorylates components such as MAPKAP1/SIN1, mTOR, RICTOR, and DEPTOR, which in turn modulate mTORC2 and AKT1 activity through negative feedback regulation. Moreover, the kinase phosphorylates IRS1, leading to its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, a process that contributes to TNF-alpha-induced insulin resistance. Other post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination and acetylation, have been observed to affect the stability and activity of RPS6KB1, while phosphorylation of mitochondrial URI1 facilitates the release of the PPP1CC phosphatase that can dephosphorylate RPS6KB1 at Thr412, thus participating in an autoregulatory negative feedback loop (majeed2019s6kinasea pages 20-21, bdzhola2025coexpressionofthe pages 9-10, murphy2021theroleof pages 111-114, sridhar2022targetingrps6k1for pages 11-13, sridhar2022targetingrps6k1for pages 14-16).\n\n7. Function  \nRPS6KB1 plays a central role as an effector of mTORC1 signaling, translating extracellular cues such as growth factor stimulation and nutrient availability into downstream anabolic processes. Its primary function is to regulate protein synthesis. This is achieved by phosphorylating key components of the translational machinery including ribosomal protein S6, which is a constituent of the 40S ribosomal subunit; eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B), which facilitates the recruitment of mRNA to the ribosome; and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (EEF2K), whose phosphorylation leads to activation of eEF2 thereby promoting translation elongation (cronin2023amechanisticapproach pages 27-34, pende2014ribosomalproteins6 pages 1-3). In addition, RPS6KB1 phosphorylates PDCD4, triggering its ubiquitination and degradation, thereby relieving its inhibitory effect on eIF4A during translation initiation. Phosphorylation of POLDIP3/SKAR by RPS6KB1 further promotes the pioneer round of translation, ensuring efficient mRNA translation from newly synthesized transcripts. Beyond its direct influence on protein synthesis, RPS6KB1 also modulates cell survival by phosphorylating and inactivating the pro-apoptotic protein BAD, thus contributing to cell survival pathways. Furthermore, the kinase is involved in metabolic regulation; for instance, it phosphorylates CAD, an enzyme in the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway, as well as EPRS which is implicated in fatty acid uptake. Through phosphorylation of IRS1, RPS6KB1 induces its degradation and thereby plays a role in the development of insulin resistance. In addition to managing translational efficiency, RPS6KB1 participates in critical feedback loops that modulate mTOR signaling by phosphorylating components of mTORC2, ultimately impacting AKT1 signaling and overall cell growth regulation (cronin2023amechanisticapproach pages 27-34, murphy2021theroleof pages 11-15, murphy2021theroleof pages 111-114).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nOwing to its pivotal role in integrating mTOR signaling with cellular translation, growth, and metabolic processes, RPS6KB1 is recognized as an attractive therapeutic target. Small-molecule inhibitors such as PF-4708671 have been developed that selectively inhibit S6K1 activity by reducing the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 and IRS1, without interfering with upstream mTORC1 or PDK1 phosphorylation events (karlsson2014clinicalpotentialof pages 42-45, sridhar2022targetingrps6k1for pages 14-16, scott2020developmentofpkn2 pages 24-29). Dysregulation of RPS6KB1 has been associated with various pathologies including cancer, insulin resistance, obesity, and other metabolic disorders. Mutations or abnormal regulatory phosphorylation on RPS6KB1 can disrupt cellular homeostasis and contribute to the pathogenesis of these diseases. RPS6KB1 activity serves as a key node in feedback regulatory loops that maintain cellular anabolic balance, and its inhibition has been shown to recapitulate some aspects of caloric restriction phenotypes. The emphasis on the development of selective inhibitors continues as ongoing studies assess both the efficacy and the specificity of such agents in modulating RPS6KB1 activity in clinical settings (karlsson2014clinicalpotentialof pages 42-45, sridhar2022targetingrps6k1for pages 14-16).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695).

Phylogeny:**  \nRPS6KB2, encoding ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta‑2 (S6K2, also known as STK14B, p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase β), is a member of the AGC kinase family that can be traced back to the last eukaryotic common ancestor. Orthologs of S6K2 have been identified across diverse mammalian species and its evolutionary history parallels that of other AGC kinases such as PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK1. Its close evolutionary relationship with S6K1 is evident from the high sequence conservation in the central kinase domain even though distinct regulatory regions have diverged over time. S6K2 and related kinases are part of an evolutionarily conserved core of TOR pathway genes, which include not only S6K but also TOR, RAPTOR, LST8, PTEN, and TSC2, among others (magnuson2012regulationandfunction pages 2-3, khalil2024s6k2infocus pages 1-3).\n\n**2. Reaction Catalyzed:**  \nS6K2 is a serine/threonine-protein kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation reaction in which ATP and a protein substrate containing serine or threonine residues are converted into ADP and the phosphorylated protein, releasing a proton in the process. The reaction can be summarized as: ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (khalil2024s6k2infocus pages 7-9, magnuson2012regulationandfunction pages 2-3).\n\n**3. Cofactor Requirements:**  \nThe kinase activity of S6K2 requires the divalent cation Mg²⁺ as a cofactor, which is essential for ATP binding and proper catalytic function. This requirement for Mg²⁺ is consistent with the behavior of most serine/threonine kinases and is noted in detailed enzymatic studies of S6 kinases (magnuson2012regulationandfunction pages 2-3, pende2014ribosomalproteins6 pages 1-3).\n\n**4. Substrate Specificity:**  \nS6K2 exhibits substrate specificity by recognizing and phosphorylating a consensus motif characterized by the sequence RxRxx[pS/T], where the serine or threonine is phosphorylated. This substrate preference has been demonstrated through studies that map the kinase domain’s substrate interactions and is similar to that observed for other members of the S6K family (yi2021ribosomalproteins6 pages 4-6, phin2003mutationalanalysisof pages 2-3).\n\n**5. Structure:**  \nS6K2 possesses a central kinase domain that is highly conserved among AGC kinases and is flanked by regulatory regions that differ from those found in S6K1. The N-terminal portion of S6K2 contains a TOR signaling (TOS) motif that is required for interaction with the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 and ensures proper mTOR-mediated phosphorylation. Unlike S6K1, which features a C-terminal PDZ-binding motif, S6K2 is characterized by a C-terminal proline-rich region followed by a nuclear localization signal (NLS), a feature that contributes to its predominantly nuclear distribution. Structural analyses and computational models reveal that the kinase domain adopts a classical bilobed organization with an N-terminal lobe containing a five-stranded β-sheet and a C-terminal lobe that is primarily helical, with a well-defined activation loop and hydrophobic motif critical for catalytic activity. Key catalytic features include the ATP-binding P-loop, the catalytic loop, and an activation segment that requires phosphorylation for full kinase activation (khalil2024s6k2infocus pages 7-9, leefruman1999characterizationofs6k2 pages 1-2, magnuson2012regulationandfunction pages 6-7).\n\n**6. Regulation:**  \nFull activation of S6K2 is achieved through a series of phosphorylation events. Initially, regulatory serine residues within the autoinhibitory region—such as Ser-410, Ser-417, and Ser-423—are phosphorylated, which relieves the inhibitory conformation. This event is followed by phosphorylation of a critical residue in the hydrophobic motif (Thr-388 in S6K2), which is mediated by mTORC1—a process that confers resistance to rapamycin in certain contexts. Finally, phosphorylation by PDK1 at the activation loop residue (Thr-228) is required for complete activation of the kinase. In addition to phosphorylation, S6K2 is subject to further post-translational modifications such as acetylation, methylation, and ubiquitination, which influence its protein stability, subcellular localization, and interaction with other signaling molecules. Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMT1, PRMT3, and PRMT6) methylate arginine residues in the nuclear localization signal region, thereby promoting nuclear retention and enhancing its pro-survival functions. Moreover, the serine/threonine phosphatase PP2A has been shown to dephosphorylate S6K2, contributing to its inactivation and cytoplasmic exclusion under certain conditions (khalil2024s6k2infocus pages 4-6, myronova2016theroleof pages 25-30, phin2003mutationalanalysisof pages 4-5).\n\n**7. Function:**  \nS6K2 functions downstream of mTOR signaling in response to growth factors and nutrient availability, playing a critical role in the regulation of protein synthesis, cell proliferation, cell size, and cell cycle progression. This kinase phosphorylates ribosomal protein S6, a key component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, thereby enhancing the translation of mRNAs that contain a 5′ oligopyrimidine tract (5′TOP mRNAs). In addition, S6K2 participates in the regulation of various cellular processes including apoptosis and cell survival by modulating the expression levels of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, and others. Its expression patterns and specific cellular localization—predominantly nuclear compared to the cytoplasmic localization of S6K1—suggest that S6K2 may have additional roles in nuclear events such as RNA processing. Furthermore, through its integration into upstream signaling pathways—including those mediated by PI3K, mTOR, and MAPK—S6K2 contributes to growth and survival signaling in cancer cells. Functional studies have implicated S6K2 in therapeutic resistance, particularly in breast cancer, where selective silencing of S6K2 enhances apoptosis and reduces the levels of pro-survival proteins. Its role in mediating distinct cellular responses to stress and growth stimuli further underscores its importance as a mediator of mTOR-driven anabolic processes (khalil2024s6k2infocus pages 9-11, myronova2016theroleof pages 41-46, sridharan2020distinctrolesof pages 1-3).\n\n**8. Other Comments:**  \nAlthough several inhibitors have been developed for the S6 kinase family, most of the commercially available inhibitors such as PF‑4708671 and LY2584702 display higher specificity for S6K1 rather than S6K2, thereby limiting the direct pharmacological targeting of S6K2. Recently, compound discovery efforts have led to the identification of a highly selective S6K2 inhibitor that exploits a unique cysteine residue in the hinge region via a covalent inhibition mechanism; however, the available functional data on this inhibitor are still limited in terms of in vitro and in vivo validation. S6K2 is implicated in cancer, with overexpression and gene amplification observed in several malignancies including breast, lung, and prostate cancers. Silencing of S6K2 in cancer-derived cell lines results in reduced cellular proliferation, increased apoptosis, and improved sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for overcoming drug resistance. No specific disease mutations in RPS6KB2 have been firmly established in the literature, and available studies primarily focus on its deregulated expression and abnormal activation in cancer cells. Its involvement in alternative signaling pathways, such as those regulated by MEAK7, further suggests a distinct yet complementary role to S6K1 in promoting cell proliferation and survival (gerstenecker2021discoveryofa pages 9-10, yi2021ribosomalproteins6 pages 4-6, khalil2024s6k2infocus pages 11-12).\n\n**9.

Plays a role as an activator of the integrated stress response (ISR) required for adaptation to amino acid starvation (By similarity). EIF2S1/eIF-2-alpha phosphorylation in response to stress converts EIF2S1/eIF-2-alpha into a global protein synthesis inhibitor, leading to a global attenuation of cap-dependent translation, and thus to a reduced overall utilization of amino acids, while concomitantly initiating the preferential translation of ISR-specific mRNAs, such as the transcriptional activator ATF4, and hence allowing ATF4-mediated reprogramming of amino acid biosynthetic gene expression to alleviate nutrient depletion (PubMed:32610081). Binds uncharged tRNAs (By similarity). Required for the translational induction of protein kinase PRKCH following amino acid starvation (By similarity).

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nGCN2 (EIF2AK4) is a highly conserved serine/threonine kinase present from yeast to mammals, and its orthologs are found in plants, fungi, and animals. It belongs to the family of eIF2α kinases, which includes other stress‐responsive members such as PKR, HRI, and PERK. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that GCN2 is among the most ancestral and ubiquitous of these kinases, with its domain architecture and regulatory features preserved across eukaryotes (rothenburg2016evolutionofeif2α pages 1-4, tatara2024emergingroleof pages 1-2). Its evolutionary lineage is defined by the presence of a histidyl-tRNA synthetase-related (HisRS-like) domain and an N-terminal RWD domain, which together mediate protein–protein interactions and help integrate environmental signals with translational control. Comparative studies suggest that GCN2 arose before the divergence of the other eIF2α kinases, underscoring its importance as a metabolic stress sensor across diverse species (rothenburg2016evolutionofeif2α pages 21-23, donnelly2013theeif2αkinases pages 18-19).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nGCN2 catalyzes the phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) using ATP as a phosphate donor. The reaction is as follows:  \nATP + eIF2α → ADP + eIF2α–phosphate + H⁺  \nThis phosphorylation occurs predominantly at a conserved serine residue (Ser51 in mammals) and converts eIF2α into an inhibitor of its guanine nucleotide exchange factor, eIF2B, thereby reducing the formation of the active eIF2-GTP ternary complex (xu2011thegcn2eif2alpha pages 9-14).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of GCN2 depends on the presence of divalent cations, with Mg²⁺ being the critical cofactor required for binding ATP and catalyzing the phosphorylation reaction. Although the literature does not elaborate extensively on additional cofactors beyond this requirement, Mg²⁺ is understood to be essential for most protein kinases, including GCN2 (rothenburg2016evolutionofeif2α pages 4-8).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nGCN2 exhibits substrate specificity for eIF2α, a central component of the translation initiation machinery. Its kinase domain phosphorylates eIF2α at a specific serine residue (Ser51 in mammalian proteins), an event that is critical for its role in translational control. Although a detailed consensus substrate motif for GCN2 has not been provided in the context sources, its substrate specificity is defined by its ability to distinguish eIF2α from other potential substrates based on both the surrounding amino acid sequence and the structural context provided by its regulatory domains (zhao2023multiplerolesof pages 1-2, dey2012transcriptionalregulationof pages 24-28).\n\n5. Structure  \nGCN2 is organized into several distinct domains which each contribute to its function as a stress sensor and kinase. Its domain architecture comprises:  \n– An N-terminal RWD domain, which mediates interactions with regulatory proteins such as GCN1 and possibly GCN20, thereby facilitating optimal activation by amino acid starvation (tatara2024emergingroleof pages 4-5, altintas2024generalcontrolnonderepressible pages 8-8).  \n– A pseudokinase domain that, while not catalytically active, is thought to play a role in the regulation of GCN2’s catalytic activity and may participate in allosteric interactions.  \n– A catalytic kinase domain responsible for the transfer of the phosphate group from ATP to eIF2α; this domain displays structural features common to Ser/Thr kinases, including a bi-lobal fold, an activation loop that undergoes autophosphorylation, and conserved motifs such as the DFG motif that are essential for catalysis (miles2021gcn2eif2kinase pages 29-36, rothenburg2016evolutionofeif2α pages 8-11).  \n– A histidyl-tRNA synthetase (HisRS)-like domain is critical for binding uncharged tRNAs that accumulate upon amino acid deprivation; binding of these tRNAs relieves autoinhibition and triggers a conformational change that facilitates dimerization and subsequent autophosphorylation of the kinase domain (altintas2024generalcontrolnonderepressible pages 1-2, zhao2023multiplerolesof pages 2-4).  \n– A C-terminal domain that contributes to dimerization and stable ribosome association, further linking GCN2 activation to translational stresses such as stalled ribosomes (altintas2024generalcontrolnonderepressible pages 7-8, lokdarshi2022reviewemergingroles pages 3-4).  \nThe overall three-dimensional structure, as predicted by crystallographic and AlphaFold models, reveals a parallel, back-to-back kinase dimer where the regulatory domains are oriented to sense molecular signals in the cytoplasm, particularly via uncharged tRNA binding (rothenburg2016evolutionofeif2α pages 4-8, lokdarshi2022reviewemergingroles pages 14-16). Key catalytic features include an autophosphorylation site in the activation loop and structural elements, such as the C-helix and hydrophobic spine, that are essential for achieving the active conformation (miles2021gcn2eif2kinase pages 29-36).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of GCN2 activity is multifaceted and tightly linked to the cell’s metabolic state. Its primary mode of activation occurs in response to amino acid deprivation, when uncharged (deacylated) tRNAs accumulate in the cytoplasm. These uncharged tRNAs bind directly to the HisRS-like domain and the C-terminal dimerization domain, relieving an autoinhibited state and promoting kinase dimerization and autophosphorylation (altintas2024generalcontrolnonderepressible pages 1-2, zhao2023multiplerolesof pages 2-4).  \nAdditional regulatory mechanisms include its interaction with GCN1 and GCN20. GCN1 acts as a scaffold, recruiting GCN2 to ribosomes and facilitating the transfer of uncharged tRNAs from the ribosomal A-site to GCN2. This association is critical for full activation of the kinase under stress conditions such as both amino acid starvation and UV irradiation (tatara2024emergingroleof pages 4-5, donnelly2013theeif2αkinases pages 18-19).  \nPost-translational modifications also play an important role in modulating GCN2 activity. Autophosphorylation within the activation loop is essential for full catalytic activation, while additional phosphorylation events may fine-tune its activity or serve as feedback inhibition mechanisms. Other stress signals, such as glucose deprivation, oxidative stress, and ribosome stalling, can also indirectly modulate GCN2 via alterations in tRNA charging or alterations in GCN1/GCN20 interactions (anda2017activationofgcn2 pages 12-13, zhao2023multiplerolesof pages 4-6).  \nGCN2 is further regulated in concert with other nutrient-sensing pathways such as the mTOR pathway; under amino acid-rich conditions, mTORC1 activity helps maintain translation while inhibiting stress responses, thereby indirectly exerting negative regulation over GCN2’s activation (zhao2023multiplerolesof pages 9-11, altintas2024generalcontrolnonderepressible pages 8-8).\n\n7. Function  \nGCN2 serves as a central metabolic stress sensor that transduces signals of amino acid deprivation and other cellular stresses into a coordinated translational response. Upon activation, the phosphorylation of eIF2α by GCN2 leads to a global reduction in cap-dependent protein synthesis, thereby conserving amino acids and reducing the burden on the protein synthesis machinery (altintas2024generalcontrolnonderepressible pages 1-2, xu2011thegcn2eif2alpha pages 9-14).  \nAt the same time, phosphorylation of eIF2α paradoxically promotes the selective translation of stress-responsive mRNAs containing upstream open reading frames (uORFs), such as that encoding the transcription factor ATF4. The increased expression of ATF4 subsequently reprograms gene expression to enhance amino acid biosynthesis, cellular redox balance, autophagy, and other processes associated with the integrated stress response (ISR) (zhao2023multiplerolesof pages 1-2, dey2012transcriptionalregulationof pages 24-28).  \nGCN2 also contributes to other biological processes beyond the ISR. It is implicated in cell cycle regulation through modulation of cyclin D1 and CDKN1A/p21 mRNA translation during unfolded protein response activation, and it plays roles in neuronal plasticity, learning, memory consolidation, and neurite outgrowth inhibition. Furthermore, GCN2 activity has been connected to proapoptotic signaling during glucose deprivation and antiviral responses by inhibiting early viral mRNA translation, thereby contributing to an innate defense against alphavirus infections (altintas2024generalcontrolnonderepressible pages 1-2, dey2012transcriptionalregulationof pages 13-19, goodman2019therolesof pages 101-105).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral experimental approaches have identified small molecule inhibitors that modulate GCN2 kinase activity, although most reports note that such inhibitors may have off-target effects. Inhibitors that impact uncharged tRNA binding or kinase autophosphorylation have been described in the literature, and ongoing research seeks to improve selectivity for therapeutic applications (joshi2013smallmoleculemodulators pages 1-2, joshi2013smallmoleculemodulators pages 7-9).  \nDisease associations for GCN2 include its involvement in conditions linked to metabolic stress, immune responses, and oncogenesis. Mutations in EIF2AK4 have been associated with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension, while aberrant ISR signaling has also been implicated in cancer, neurodegeneration, and inflammatory disorders. Functional mutations that compromise GCN2’s activation or substrate phosphorylation can perturb the balance of protein synthesis and stress adaptation, impacting cell survival under adverse conditions (altintas2024generalcontrolnonderepressible pages 8-8, zhao2023multiplerolesof pages 15-16, tatara2024emergingroleof pages 17-18).\n\n9.

Recognizes the substrate consensus sequence [ST]-Q (PubMed:10550055, PubMed:10839545, PubMed:10910365, PubMed:12556884, PubMed:14871926, PubMed:15448695, PubMed:15456891, PubMed:15916964, PubMed:17923702, PubMed:24534091, PubMed:9733514). Phosphorylates 'Ser-139' of histone variant H2AX at double strand breaks (DSBs), thereby regulating DNA damage response mechanism (By similarity). Also plays a role in pre-B cell allelic exclusion, a process leading to expression of a single immunoglobulin heavy chain allele to enforce clonality and monospecific recognition by the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) expressed on individual B-lymphocytes. After the introduction of DNA breaks by the RAG complex on one immunoglobulin allele, acts by mediating a repositioning of the second allele to pericentromeric heterochromatin, preventing accessibility to the RAG complex and recombination of the second allele.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nATM (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated) is a large serine/threonine kinase that is a member of the phosphatidylinositol 3‐kinase‐related kinase (PIKK) family. This evolutionary conserved family also comprises ATR, DNA-PKcs, mTOR, SMG1 and TRRAP, and its origin can be traced back to early eukaryotes, reflecting an ancient origin found in organisms ranging from yeast to mammals (bhatti2011atmproteinkinase pages 1-3, shiloh2013theatmprotein pages 2-3). Orthologs of ATM have been identified in all metazoans with conservation of key domains such as the FAT, kinase and FATC domains, which are the characteristic hallmarks of the PIKK family (bhatti2011atmproteinkinase pages 1-3, ueno2022atmfunctionsof pages 1-2). Evolutionarily, ATM shares structural and mechanistic similarities with yeast Tel1, and the divergence within the PIKK family is thought to have occurred prior to the evolution of higher eukaryotes, situating ATM within a core group of kinases essential for maintaining genomic integrity (lee2021cellularfunctionsof pages 2-3, pavletich2022structureofthe pages 5-8).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nATM catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to serine or threonine residues in its target proteins. The reaction can be summarized as: ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺. This phosphorylation is central to the activation of numerous substrates involved in the DNA damage response (shiloh2013theatmprotein pages 1-2, putti2021atmkinasedead pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of ATM is dependent on the presence of magnesium ions (Mg²⁺). Mg²⁺ ions are required for proper ATP binding and kinase activity, functioning as essential cofactors to facilitate the phosphoryl transfer reaction (bhatti2011atmproteinkinase pages 1-3, pavletich2022structureofthe pages 1-5).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nATM recognizes and phosphorylates substrates primarily on serine/threonine residues that are immediately followed by a glutamine residue, i.e. the SQ or TQ motifs. This consensus motif is critical for substrate recognition and ensures that ATM selectively targets proteins involved in chromatin remodeling, DNA repair, and cell cycle checkpoint control. Notable substrates include the histone variant H2AX (phosphorylated on serine-139 to form γH2AX), p53, Chk2, and several components of the MRN complex (shiloh2013theatmprotein pages 1-2, putti2021atmkinasedead pages 1-2, bhatti2011atmproteinkinase pages 20-22).\n\n5. Structure  \nATM is organized into several distinct domains that collectively mediate its catalytic and regulatory functions. The N-terminal region is composed largely of HEAT repeat motifs that form a flexible solenoid and provide a scaffold for protein-protein interactions and binding of partner proteins (pavletich2022structureofthe pages 5-8, bhatti2011atmproteinkinase pages 3-4). Downstream of the HEAT repeats, the C-terminal region of ATM contains the highly conserved FAT domain, the central kinase domain and the short FATC domain. The FAT domain plays a dual role in structural stability and autoinhibitory regulation, as it forms extensive contacts that help maintain ATM in an inactive dimeric state prior to activation (pavletich2022structureofthe pages 51-55, bhatti2011atmproteinkinase pages 7-9). The kinase domain is structurally similar to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases, possessing an N-lobe and a C-lobe that form the catalytic cleft where ATP binds; critical lysine residues within the N lobe align ATP’s phosphate groups for phosphotransfer (lau2016structureofthe pages 8-8, pavletich2022structureofthe pages 21-25). The FATC domain at the extreme C-terminus is essential for full catalytic activity and proper folding, and is known to undergo post-translational modifications such as acetylation (bhatti2011atmproteinkinase pages 3-4, putti2021atmkinasedead pages 11-13). Moreover, ATM exists in an inactive homodimeric form in resting cells; activation by DNA double-strand breaks leads to autophosphorylation (notably at Ser1981) and dissociation into active monomers (shiloh2013theatmprotein pages 1-2, lau2016structureofthe pages 1-2).\n\n6. Regulation  \nATM regulation is multifaceted and involves several layers of control. In response to DNA double-strand breaks, ATM is recruited to the sites of damage by the MRN complex (MRE11-RAD50-NBS1) and is activated by autophosphorylation events following conformational changes in its dimeric structure (shiloh2013theatmprotein pages 7-8, bhatti2011atmproteinkinase pages 9-10). Post-translational modifications are critical for the fine-tuning of ATM activity. Key modifications include autophosphorylation at Ser1981, which is required for dissociation of the inactive dimer to form the active monomer (shiloh2013theatmprotein pages 1-2, putti2021atmkinasedead pages 1-2). In addition, the acetylation of ATM by the Tip60 histone acetyltransferase, particularly at lysine residues such as K3016, is necessary for full activation (bhatti2011atmproteinkinase pages 16-18, shiloh2013theatmprotein pages 14-14). Other regulatory mechanisms involve phosphorylation-dependent interactions with downstream effectors (e.g., phosphorylation of p53, CHK2, and BRCA1) and the action of phosphatases such as PP2A and PP5, which serve to dephosphorylate and thereby inactivate ATM once the DNA damage response is resolved (oberle2010regulationofthe pages 3-4, shiloh2013theatmprotein pages 5-6). Furthermore, oxidative stress can independently activate ATM through disulfide bond formation involving specific cysteine residues, thereby linking ATM’s activity to the cellular redox state (bhatti2011atmproteinkinase pages 20-22, shiloh2013theatmprotein pages 6-7).\n\n7. Function  \nThe biological role of ATM centers on its function as a master regulator of the cellular response to DNA damage and genotoxic stress. Upon sensing DNA double-strand breaks, ATM phosphorylates a wide array of substrates that coordinate cell cycle checkpoints, DNA repair processes (including homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining), and apoptosis. For example, phosphorylation of histone H2AX at Ser-139 facilitates the recruitment of DNA repair complexes, while modification of p53 leads to cell cycle arrest or programmed cell death as required (shiloh2013theatmprotein pages 1-2, putti2021atmkinasedead pages 1-2). Beyond nuclear DNA repair, ATM activity is implicated in other cellular pathways; it is involved in the regulation of the immune response through control of pre-B cell allelic exclusion, in vesicle and protein transport, and in signal transduction processes that affect cell cycle progression (bhatti2011atmproteinkinase pages 20-22, putti2021atmkinasedead pages 2-3). Additionally, ATM plays roles in metabolism and oxidative stress response by modulating pathways that influence mitochondrial function and pexophagy, as evidenced by its phosphorylation of proteins like PEX5 in response to reactive oxygen species (ueno2022atmfunctionsof pages 13-14, shiloh2013theatmprotein pages 14-14). Expression of ATM is ubiquitous, with particularly high expression in tissues where genomic maintenance is critical, such as the brain, immune organs, and dividing somatic cells (amirifar2019ataxia‐telangiectasiaareview pages 1-4, shiloh2013theatmprotein pages 11-12).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nATM is a key tumor suppressor and its dysfunction is associated with a number of clinical conditions. Germline mutations in the ATM gene cause Ataxia-Telangiectasia (A-T), a recessive disorder characterized by neurodegeneration, immunodeficiency, predisposition to cancer (especially lymphoid malignancies), and radiosensitivity (bhatti2011atmproteinkinase pages 20-22, amirifar2019ataxia‐telangiectasiaareview pages 16-19). In cancer, heterozygous mutations as well as somatic mutations in ATM can contribute to genomic instability and influence treatment response; in particular, “kinase-dead” mutations where ATM protein is expressed but lacks catalytic activity have been shown to enhance oncogenic phenotypes and modulate sensitivity to specific chemotherapy agents such as PARP inhibitors and topoisomerase inhibitors (putti2021atmkinasedead pages 7-8, putti2021atmkinasedead pages 8-10). Several experimental inhibitors targeting ATM kinase activity are under investigation in preclinical studies and early clinical trials, with the goal of sensitizing tumor cells to DNA-damaging agents and radiotherapy (williams2020structuresandregulations pages 8-8, shiloh2013theatmprotein pages 6-7). These inhibitors, while demonstrating potential therapeutic benefits, require further development to achieve specificity given ATM’s broad role in genome maintenance (putti2021atmkinasedead pages 7-8, shiloh2013theatmprotein pages 14-14).\n\n9.

MTOR directly or indirectly regulates the phosphorylation of at least 800 proteins (PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:17517883, PubMed:18372248, PubMed:18497260, PubMed:18925875, PubMed:20516213, PubMed:21576368, PubMed:21659604, PubMed:23429704, PubMed:29236692, PubMed:37751742). Functions as part of 2 structurally and functionally distinct signaling complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2 (mTOR complex 1 and 2) (PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:18497260, PubMed:18925875, PubMed:20516213, PubMed:21576368, PubMed:21659604, PubMed:23429704, PubMed:29424687, PubMed:29567957, PubMed:35926713). In response to nutrients, growth factors or amino acids, mTORC1 is recruited to the lysosome membrane and promotes protein, lipid and nucleotide synthesis by phosphorylating key regulators of mRNA translation and ribosome synthesis (PubMed:12087098, PubMed:12150925, PubMed:12150926, PubMed:12231510, PubMed:12718876, PubMed:14651849, PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:15545625, PubMed:15718470, PubMed:18497260, PubMed:18762023, PubMed:18925875, PubMed:20516213, PubMed:20537536, PubMed:21659604, PubMed:23429703, PubMed:23429704, PubMed:25799227, PubMed:26018084, PubMed:29150432, PubMed:29236692, PubMed:31112131, PubMed:34519269). This includes phosphorylation of EIF4EBP1 and release of its inhibition toward the elongation initiation factor 4E (eiF4E) (PubMed:24403073, PubMed:29236692). Moreover, phosphorylates and activates RPS6KB1 and RPS6KB2 that promote protein synthesis by modulating the activity of their downstream targets including ribosomal protein S6, eukaryotic translation initiation factor EIF4B, and the inhibitor of translation initiation PDCD4 (PubMed:12087098, PubMed:12150925, PubMed:18925875, PubMed:29150432, PubMed:29236692). Stimulates the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, both by acute regulation through RPS6KB1-mediated phosphorylation of the biosynthetic enzyme CAD, and delayed regulation, through transcriptional enhancement of the pentose phosphate pathway which produces 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP), an allosteric activator of CAD at a later step in synthesis, this function is dependent on the mTORC1 complex (PubMed:23429703, PubMed:23429704). Regulates ribosome synthesis by activating RNA polymerase III-dependent transcription through phosphorylation and inhibition of MAF1 an RNA polymerase III-repressor (PubMed:20516213). Activates dormant ribosomes by mediating phosphorylation of SERBP1, leading to SERBP1 inactivation and reactivation of translation (PubMed:36691768). In parallel to protein synthesis, also regulates lipid synthesis through SREBF1/SREBP1 and LPIN1 (PubMed:23426360). To maintain energy homeostasis mTORC1 may also regulate mitochondrial biogenesis through regulation of PPARGC1A (By similarity). In the same time, mTORC1 inhibits catabolic pathways: negatively regulates autophagy through phosphorylation of ULK1 (PubMed:32561715). Under nutrient sufficiency, phosphorylates ULK1 at 'Ser-758', disrupting the interaction with AMPK and preventing activation of ULK1 (PubMed:32561715). Also prevents autophagy through phosphorylation of the autophagy inhibitor DAP (PubMed:20537536). Also prevents autophagy by phosphorylating RUBCNL/Pacer under nutrient-rich conditions (PubMed:30704899). Prevents autophagy by mediating phosphorylation of AMBRA1, thereby inhibiting AMBRA1 ability to mediate ubiquitination of ULK1 and interaction between AMBRA1 and PPP2CA (PubMed:23524951, PubMed:25438055). mTORC1 exerts a feedback control on upstream growth factor signaling that includes phosphorylation and activation of GRB10 a INSR-dependent signaling suppressor (PubMed:21659604). Among other potential targets mTORC1 may phosphorylate CLIP1 and regulate microtubules (PubMed:12231510). The mTORC1 complex is inhibited in response to starvation and amino acid depletion (PubMed:12150925, PubMed:12150926, PubMed:24403073, PubMed:31695197). The non-canonical mTORC1 complex, which acts independently of RHEB, specifically mediates phosphorylation of MiT/TFE factors MITF, TFEB and TFE3 in the presence of nutrients, promoting their cytosolic retention and inactivation (PubMed:22343943, PubMed:22576015, PubMed:22692423, PubMed:24448649, PubMed:32612235, PubMed:36608670, PubMed:36697823). Upon starvation or lysosomal stress, inhibition of mTORC1 induces dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of TFEB and TFE3, promoting their transcription factor activity (PubMed:22343943, PubMed:22576015, PubMed:22692423, PubMed:24448649, PubMed:32612235, PubMed:36608670). The mTORC1 complex regulates pyroptosis in macrophages by promoting GSDMD oligomerization (PubMed:34289345). MTOR phosphorylates RPTOR which in turn inhibits mTORC1 (By similarity). As part of the mTORC2 complex, MTOR transduces signals from growth factors to pathways involved in proliferation, cytoskeletal organization, lipogenesis and anabolic output (PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:24670654, PubMed:29424687, PubMed:29567957, PubMed:35926713). In response to growth factors, mTORC2 phosphorylates and activates AGC protein kinase family members, including AKT (AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3), PKC (PRKCA, PRKCB and PRKCE) and SGK1 (PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:21376236, PubMed:24670654, PubMed:29424687, PubMed:29567957, PubMed:35926713). In contrast to mTORC1, mTORC2 is nutrient-insensitive (PubMed:15467718). mTORC2 plays a critical role in AKT1 activation by mediating phosphorylation of different sites depending on the context, such as 'Thr-450', 'Ser-473', 'Ser-477' or 'Thr-479', facilitating the phosphorylation of the activation loop of AKT1 on 'Thr-308' by PDPK1/PDK1 which is a prerequisite for full activation (PubMed:15718470, PubMed:21376236, PubMed:24670654, PubMed:29424687, PubMed:29567957). mTORC2 also regulates the phosphorylation of SGK1 at 'Ser-422' (PubMed:18925875). mTORC2 may regulate the actin cytoskeleton, through phosphorylation of PRKCA, PXN and activation of the Rho-type guanine nucleotide exchange factors RHOA and RAC1A or RAC1B (PubMed:15268862). The mTORC2 complex also phosphorylates various proteins involved in insulin signaling, such as FBXW8 and IGF2BP1 (By similarity). May also regulate insulin signaling by acting as a tyrosine protein kinase that catalyzes phosphorylation of IGF1R and INSR; additional evidence are however required to confirm this result in vivo (PubMed:26584640). Regulates osteoclastogenesis by adjusting the expression of CEBPB isoforms (By similarity). Plays an important regulatory role in the circadian clock function; regulates period length and rhythm amplitude of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and liver clocks (By similarity)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nSerine/threonine‐protein kinase mTOR belongs to the phosphatidylinositol 3‐kinase–related kinase (PIKK) family, a group of large, evolutionarily conserved kinases that share a highly preserved catalytic core and specialized regulatory domains. Orthologs of mTOR have been identified throughout eukaryotes—from yeast to mammals—indicating that its function as a nutrient‐sensing regulatory molecule originated as early as the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) (alexander2015theconciseguide pages 1-2). In evolutionary reconstructions, mTOR clusters with other PIKK family members, such as ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (ATM and Rad3-related), which typically function to preserve genomic stability via DNA damage responses. However, in contrast to ATM and ATR, mTOR primarily integrates a wide variety of extracellular signals including hormones, growth factors, and nutrients with intracellular energy status and stress signals to coordinate both anabolic and catabolic processes (alexander2017theconciseguide pages 2-3, eliasvillalobos2019newinsightsinto pages 1-6). Moreover, the presence of extensive tandem HEAT repeats in the N-terminal region, along with a well‐preserved kinase domain across multiple species, reinforces the concept that mTOR’s central role in growth and metabolism regulation is ancient and highly conserved (tobak2007constructionofthe pages 7-15, panwar2023multifacetedroleof pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nmTOR functions as a serine/threonine kinase that catalyzes the ATP‐dependent phosphorylation of protein substrates. The canonical reaction it facilitates can be represented as follows:  \nATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺.  \nThis reaction underpins mTOR’s regulatory capacity over a wide range of cellular processes, enabling it to modify the activity, stability, or interactions of its substrates through the addition of a phosphate group. Such phosphorylation events are critical for the modulation of processes like protein synthesis, ribosome biogenesis, lipid metabolism, and autophagy (alexander2015theconciseguide pages 1-2, alexander2017theconciseguide pages 2-3).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of mTOR is strictly ATP‐dependent. It requires divalent cations, with magnesium (Mg²⁺) being the principal cofactor. This Mg²⁺ cofactor stabilizes the binding of ATP within the kinase’s catalytic pocket and facilitates the correct alignment of the phosphate groups for the transfer reaction. The necessity for Mg²⁺ is consistent with the enzymatic behavior of other protein kinases in the PIKK family, ensuring both the efficiency of phosphoryl transfer and the structural integrity of the active site (alexander2015theconciseguide pages 1-2, liu2012kinomewideselectivityprofiling pages 9-10).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nmTOR exhibits broad substrate specificity, directly or indirectly regulating the phosphorylation of over 800 protein targets. Among its best characterized substrates are components central to the regulation of mRNA translation and ribosome biogenesis, such as the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (EIF4EBP1) and the ribosomal protein S6 kinases (RPS6KB1 and RPS6KB2). For example, phosphorylation of EIF4EBP1 by mTOR disrupts its binding to eIF4E, thereby lifting the repression on cap-dependent translation initiation. In addition, mTOR-mediated phosphorylation of RPS6KB1/2 leads to the activation of downstream effectors, including ribosomal protein S6 and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4B (EIF4B), which are crucial for efficient protein synthesis. Although an explicit consensus phosphorylation motif for mTOR is not as distinctly defined as for some other kinases, substrate recognition is governed largely by the structural context provided by the mTOR complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2). Substrates generally encompass serine/threonine residues that are embedded in regulatory sequences controlling anabolic processes, lipid metabolism, autophagy, and nucleotide synthesis (alexander2015theconciseguide pages 1-2, alexander2017theconciseguide pages 5-8, liu2012kinomewideselectivityprofiling pages 1-1, armando2022gproteincoupledreceptor pages 18-19).\n\n5. Structure  \nmTOR is a multidomain protein whose structural complexity reflects its multifaceted regulatory functions. Its key structural features include:  \n• The N-terminal region, characterized by approximately 20 tandem HEAT repeats, forms an elongated solenoid that mediates extensive protein–protein interactions. These HEAT repeats are essential for the assembly of the two distinct mTOR complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, by facilitating interactions with regulatory proteins such as RAPTOR in mTORC1 and RICTOR in mTORC2 (tobak2007constructionofthe pages 7-15).  \n• Adjacent to the HEAT repeats lies the FAT domain (named for FRAP, ATM, and TRRAP), which contributes to the overall structural integrity and proper folding of mTOR, as well as to intra‐molecular interactions that are critical for maintaining kinase activity.  \n• Central to mTOR’s function is its catalytic kinase domain. This domain shares sequence and structural homology with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K), encompassing the ATP-binding pocket and essential catalytic residues. Within the kinase domain, features such as the activation loop, hydrophobic spine, and the C-helix are present; these elements are characteristic of an active kinase conformation and are vital for the binding of ATP and small molecule inhibitors (tobak2007constructionofthe pages 32-39, alexander2017theconciseguide pages 5-8).  \n• Integrated within the catalytic core is the FRB (FKBP12-rapamycin binding) domain, a conserved module that is responsible for binding the FKBP12-rapamycin complex. This interaction serves as the basis for allosteric inhibition by rapamycin, making the FRB domain a critical regulatory motif (tobak2007constructionofthe pages 39-44).  \n• At the extreme C-terminus, mTOR contains the FATC domain. This short, conserved segment is necessary for full kinase activity and helps stabilize the overall structure of the catalytic domain.  \nHomology modeling studies have employed the crystal structure of PI3Kγ as a template to elucidate the three-dimensional organization of the mTOR kinase domain, confirming that features such as the ATP-binding pocket, activation loop arrangement, and hydrophobic spine are conserved and functionally significant (tobak2007constructionofthe pages 32-39, tobak2007constructionofthe pages 39-44).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulatory mechanisms governing mTOR activity are both intricate and dynamic, ensuring that its kinase function is tightly controlled in response to a variety of cellular signals. Within the mTORC1 complex, the regulatory subunit RAPTOR acts as a scaffold to not only stabilize the complex but also facilitate the recruitment of both substrates and upstream activators. For instance, under nutrient-rich conditions, mTORC1 is localized to the lysosomal membrane where it becomes activated by RHEB GTPase. Active mTORC1 phosphorylates several downstream targets including EIF4EBP1 and RPS6KB1, which in turn enhance protein synthesis (alexander2015theconciseguide pages 1-2, rowland2010identificationoftheb pages 163-165).  \nNotably, mTORC1 phosphorylates ULK1 at Ser758 under nutrient sufficiency, which disrupts its interaction with AMPK and inhibits the initiation of autophagy. Additionally, mTORC1 mediates feedback inhibition on upstream growth factor signaling through the phosphorylation of GRB10, thereby modulating insulin receptor signals (panwar2023multifacetedroleof pages 1-2, shams2021evaluationofthe pages 13-14).  \nIn contrast, mTORC2, which is largely nutrient-insensitive, primarily responds to growth factor cues. Its regulatory subunits—most notably RICTOR and SIN1—determine substrate specificity for mTORC2. One of the critical functions of mTORC2 is the phosphorylation of AGC kinase family members such as AKT. Phosphorylation of AKT by mTORC2 at multiple residues (including Thr-450, Ser-473, Ser-477, and Thr-479) is essential for subsequent phosphorylation events by PDPK1/PDK1 and complete activation of AKT signaling (alexander2017theconciseguide pages 2-3, liu2012kinomewideselectivityprofiling pages 9-10).  \nFurthermore, mTOR can undergo autophosphorylation and interact with additional regulatory proteins via dynamic exchange of complex components, contributing to its context-dependent modulation. These multiple layers of regulation ensure that mTOR activity is finely adjusted in accordance with cellular nutrient status, energy levels, and extrinsic growth factor signals (alexander2015theconciseguide pages 1-2, panwar2023multifacetedroleof pages 1-2, shams2021evaluationofthe pages 13-14).\n\n7. Function  \nmTOR acts as a master regulator orchestrating cellular growth, metabolism, and survival processes by integrating diverse signals from the environment. As part of the mTORC1 complex, mTOR promotes anabolic processes when nutrients are abundant. Specifically, it phosphorylates EIF4EBP1 to alleviate its inhibition on eIF4E, thereby enhancing cap‐dependent mRNA translation and stimulating protein synthesis. Concurrently, the phosphorylation of RPS6KB1/2 leads to activation of downstream effectors such as ribosomal protein S6 and EIF4B, further supporting ribosome biogenesis and translation (alexander2015theconciseguide pages 1-2, rowland2010identificationoftheb pages 163-165).  \nmTORC1 also plays a pivotal role in regulating lipid production through the modulation of transcription factors like SREBF1 and enzymes such as LPIN1, in addition to stimulating nucleotide synthesis through both the acute phosphorylation of enzymes such as CAD and transcriptional support via stimulation of the pentose phosphate pathway. In parallel, mTORC1 represses autophagy under nutrient‐rich conditions by phosphorylating ULK1 and other autophagy regulators (panwar2023multifacetedroleof pages 1-2, eliasvillalobos2019newinsightsinto pages 1-6).  \nConversely, in the context of the mTORC2 complex, mTOR transduces growth factor signals that are fundamental for cell survival, proliferation, and cytoskeletal organization. mTORC2 phosphorylates and activates members of the AGC kinase family, including AKT, PKC isoforms, and SGK1, thereby contributing to processes such as actin cytoskeleton remodeling, cell migration, and metabolic control. The phosphorylation events mediated by mTORC2 ensure proper activation of AKT, which then coordinates further downstream metabolic and survival pathways (alexander2017theconciseguide pages 2-3, liu2012kinomewideselectivityprofiling pages 9-10, armando2022gproteincoupledreceptor pages 18-19).  \nTogether, mTORC1 and mTORC2 serve as essential nodes in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. mTOR’s ubiquitous expression across diverse tissues and cell types underscores its central role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by balancing anabolic growth and catabolic degradation in response to fluctuating nutrient levels and growth signals (alexander2015theconciseguide pages 1-2, panwar2023multifacetedroleof pages 1-2).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nA wide array of inhibitors has been developed targeting mTOR due to its central involvement in numerous diseases, particularly cancer and metabolic disorders. The prototypical inhibitor, rapamycin, together with its analogs (rapalogs), binds to the FRB domain of mTOR in a complex with FKBP12, thereby exerting an allosteric inhibition that primarily affects mTORC1. However, because mTORC2 remains relatively insensitive to short-term rapamycin treatment, second-generation ATP-competitive inhibitors such as Torin1 and PP242 have been designed to target the catalytic domain of mTOR, resulting in broad inhibition of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities (tobak2007constructionofthe pages 15-21, panwar2023multifacetedroleof pages 1-2).  \nAdditionally, mTOR signaling is frequently hyperactivated in a variety of malignancies due to genetic alterations in upstream regulators—for example, mutations in PI3K, loss of PTEN function, or direct mutations in the MTOR gene itself. Such aberrations lead to uncontrolled cellular proliferation and survival, making mTOR an attractive therapeutic target in oncology. Structural insights, particularly those derived from homology modeling of the mTOR kinase domain based on PI3Kγ structures, continue to inform the rational design of novel inhibitors with improved specificity and reduced adverse effects (tobak2007constructionofthe pages 32-39, tobak2007constructionofthe pages 39-44).  \nFurthermore, mTOR’s extensive substrate repertoire, including its regulation of key proteins involved in translation (such as EIF4EBP1 and RPS6KB1/2), lipid synthesis, and autophagy, has implicated this kinase in a range of pathologies beyond cancer, including metabolic syndromes, neurodegenerative disorders, and immunological diseases. These observations emphasize the necessity for continued research into mTOR’s structural and functional mechanisms to facilitate the development of more selective and effective therapeutic agents (safi2023phaseseparationbasedvisualization pages 15-16, shams2021evaluationofthe pages 13-14).\n\n9.

CDK1/CDC2-cyclin-B controls pronuclear union in interphase fertilized eggs (PubMed:18480403, PubMed:20360007). Essential for early stages of embryonic development (PubMed:18480403, PubMed:20360007). During G2 and early mitosis, CDC25A/B/C-mediated dephosphorylation activates CDK1/cyclin complexes which phosphorylate several substrates that trigger at least centrosome separation, Golgi dynamics, nuclear envelope breakdown and chromosome condensation (PubMed:18480403, PubMed:20360007, PubMed:2188730, PubMed:2344612, PubMed:30139873). Once chromosomes are condensed and aligned at the metaphase plate, CDK1 activity is switched off by WEE1- and PKMYT1-mediated phosphorylation to allow sister chromatid separation, chromosome decondensation, reformation of the nuclear envelope and cytokinesis (PubMed:18480403, PubMed:20360007).

In proliferating cells, CDK1-mediated FOXO1 phosphorylation at the G2-M phase represses FOXO1 interaction with 14-3-3 proteins and thereby promotes FOXO1 nuclear accumulation and transcription factor activity, leading to cell death of postmitotic neurons (PubMed:18356527). The phosphorylation of beta-tubulins regulates microtubule dynamics during mitosis (PubMed:16371510). NEDD1 phosphorylation promotes PLK1-mediated NEDD1 phosphorylation and subsequent targeting of the gamma-tubulin ring complex (gTuRC) to the centrosome, an important step for spindle formation (PubMed:19509060). In addition, CC2D1A phosphorylation regulates CC2D1A spindle pole localization and association with SCC1/RAD21 and centriole cohesion during mitosis (PubMed:20171170). The phosphorylation of Bcl-xL/BCL2L1 after prolongated G2 arrest upon DNA damage triggers apoptosis (PubMed:19917720). In contrast, CASP8 phosphorylation during mitosis prevents its activation by proteolysis and subsequent apoptosis (PubMed:20937773). This phosphorylation occurs in cancer cell lines, as well as in primary breast tissues and lymphocytes (PubMed:20937773). EZH2 phosphorylation promotes H3K27me3 maintenance and epigenetic gene silencing (PubMed:20935635). CALD1 phosphorylation promotes Schwann cell migration during peripheral nerve regeneration (By similarity). CDK1-cyclin-B complex phosphorylates NCKAP5L and mediates its dissociation from centrosomes during mitosis (PubMed:26549230). Regulates the amplitude of the cyclic expression of the core clock gene BMAL1 by phosphorylating its transcriptional repressor NR1D1, and this phosphorylation is necessary for SCF(FBXW7)-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of NR1D1 (PubMed:27238018).

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563).

Phylogeny  \nCyclin‐dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) is an evolutionarily conserved member of the CMGC kinase group, sharing high sequence and functional similarity with well‐studied yeast cell cycle regulators such as CDC2 in fission yeast and CDC28 in budding yeast. CDK1 is found in all eukaryotic organisms and can be traced back to an ancestral kinase present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor. Its evolutionary conservation is evident from genomic and phylogenetic analyses that group CDK1 alongside other cell cycle–regulating kinases, highlighting its critical role in driving mitosis across species (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 1-2, liu2000evolutionofcyclindependent pages 1-1, hanks1995theeukaryoticprotein pages 5-6).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK1 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to target proteins on serine or threonine residues. In its catalytic reaction, ATP binds to the kinase along with the substrate protein, which then results in the formation of ADP and a phosphorylated protein product. This phosphorylation reaction is written as:  \n  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺  \nThis mechanism is fundamental for altering the activity, stability or subcellular localization of numerous substrates involved in cell cycle regulation (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 1-2, hanks1995theeukaryoticprotein pages 5-6).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of CDK1 is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions, specifically Mg²⁺, which are essential cofactors. Mg²⁺ ions coordinate with ATP to facilitate the proper positioning of the phosphate groups for transfer and are required for optimal kinase activity across the CDK family (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 1-2, hanks1995theeukaryoticprotein pages 5-6).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCDK1 exhibits substrate specificity characterized by its preference for serine/threonine residues followed by a proline residue, which is encapsulated in the consensus motif S/T-P. This preference is dictated primarily by the conformation of the active site and involves recognition of sequences in target substrates that are often primed by prior phosphorylation events or influenced by cyclin binding. The kinase’s substrate specificity is further modulated by its association with specific cyclin partners, which not only activate CDK1 but also help determine the subset of substrates recognized during different cell cycle phases (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 3-5, wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 22-23).\n\n5. Structure  \nCDK1 consists of a conserved kinase domain that is organized into two principal lobes: a smaller N-terminal lobe rich in beta-sheets and a larger C-terminal lobe primarily composed of alpha-helices. A defining feature of CDK1 is the highly conserved PSTAIRE motif located in the αC-helix, which is critical for cyclin binding and subsequent activation of the kinase. The activation segment, which includes a T-loop, undergoes conformational rearrangements upon cyclin binding; its phosphorylation by CDK-activating kinases (CAKs) is required for full enzyme activity. In addition, the catalytic cleft is positioned between the two lobes, providing the binding site for ATP and facilitating the transfer of the phosphate group to substrates. The overall structural organization of CDK1, including the arrangement of its glycine-rich loop, hinge region, and catalytic residues, has been illuminated by crystallographic studies of related CDK–cyclin complexes, illustrating a typical serine/threonine kinase fold with conserved features that are shared with other members of the CDK family (wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 3-4, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 7-8).\n\n6. Regulation  \nCDK1 activity is regulated by a complex network of mechanisms that include association with cyclin proteins, phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events, and interactions with inhibitory proteins. Activation of CDK1 generally requires binding to mitotic cyclins (most notably cyclin B) or, under certain circumstances, interphase cyclins; this association induces structural changes that reposition the T-loop, allowing substrate access. Full activation further depends on phosphorylation of a conserved threonine residue in the T-loop (analogous to Thr161 in CDK2), which is catalyzed by a CDK-activating kinase (typically CDK7 within the CAK complex). Conversely, CDK1 is negatively regulated through inhibitory phosphorylation at residues corresponding to Thr14 and Tyr15 by kinases such as WEE1 and MYT1; these phosphorylations keep the kinase inactive until they are removed by the CDC25 family of phosphatases. This precise regulation ensures that CDK1 activity is coordinated with cell cycle progression, particularly at the G2-M transition and during mitotic events such as centrosome separation, nuclear envelope breakdown, and chromosome condensation. In addition to post-translational modifications, the dynamic levels of cyclin binding partners and the action of specific CDK inhibitors further contribute to the tight regulation of CDK1 (wang2023targetingcdk1in pages 1-2, malumbres2005mammaliancyclindependentkinases pages 7-8, hanks1995theeukaryoticprotein pages 5-6).\n\n7. Function  \nCDK1 is a master regulator of the eukaryotic cell cycle, playing a central role in orchestrating the G2-M transition and driving the onset of mitosis. Once activated, CDK1 phosphorylates numerous substrates that are critical for a wide range of mitotic events including centrosome separation, Golgi fragmentation, nuclear envelope breakdown, and chromosome condensation. The extensive substrate profile of CDK1 includes key proteins such as components of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), retinoblastoma protein (RB1), lamin proteins (LMNA, LMNB1, LMNB2), and a variety of mitotic spindle regulators. CDK1-mediated phosphorylation also modulates transcription factors, cell cycle checkpoint proteins, apoptosis regulators, and proteins involved in cytoskeletal reorganization. Expression studies indicate that CDK1 is ubiquitously expressed in proliferating cells and is essential for early embryonic development, with complete loss resulting in embryonic lethality. Its function is tightly integrated with upstream regulators (including cyclins and CAKs) and downstream effectors that together ensure the faithful execution of cell division. The kinase’s activity is also implicated in DNA damage checkpoint control, where its inhibition allows time for repair mechanisms prior to mitotic entry. Thus, through its ability to phosphorylate a broad array of substrates, CDK1 coordinates multiple aspects of cell cycle progression and mitotic execution, underscoring its pivotal role in cellular proliferation (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 5-6, wang2023targetingcdk1in pages 12-13, wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 20-20).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral small molecule inhibitors targeting CDK1 and related kinases have been evaluated as potential anticancer agents due to the kinase’s central role in cell division. Agents such as dinaciclib and flavopiridol have been studied in clinical settings, with the aim of inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in tumor cells. Dysregulation of CDK1 has been associated with a variety of cancers; overexpression or aberrant activation contributes to uncontrolled proliferation, chromosomal instability, and therapeutic resistance. Moreover, mutations that affect CDK1 regulation or its interacting partners can compromise cell cycle checkpoints and promote tumorigenesis. As a result, CDK1 continues to be a high-priority target for the development of new chemotherapeutic strategies. Research efforts also focus on combination therapies that target CDK1 together with other signaling pathways to improve treatment outcomes. Although many inhibitors are experimental and their specificity varies, ongoing clinical trials highlight the therapeutic potential of precise CDK1 suppression in oncology (wang2023targetingcdk1in pages 5-8, malumbres2005mammaliancyclindependentkinases pages 9-10).\n\n9.

S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nCyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) is a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) family that is conserved throughout eukaryotes and plays a central role in cell cycle regulation. CDK2 is ubiquitously present in mammals and shares high sequence and structural homology with other cell cycle–regulating kinases such as CDK1 and CDK3, as originally defined in kinome analyses (wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2, equinet2004studiesonthe pages 47-51). Phylogenetic assessments classify CDK2 within the CMGC group of serine/threonine kinases, an evolutionarily conserved family that emerged early in eukaryotic evolution and is closely related to other cell cycle kinases outlined by Manning et al. (karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 1-2). Orthologs of CDK2 are present in diverse eukaryotic species, and its evolutionary conservation underscores its essential functions in controlling complex processes such as DNA synthesis and centrosome duplication (equinet2004studiesonthe pages 44-47, pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 7-8).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK2 catalyzes the transfer of the γ‐phosphate from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues on protein substrates. In its catalytic reaction, ATP and a substrate protein with a serine/threonine residue are converted to ADP and a phosphorylated substrate, thereby modulating the function of its protein targets (meschini2011purinebaseddualinhibitors pages 280-282, pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 4-5).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of CDK2 depends critically on the presence of divalent metal ions, with Mg²⁺ serving as a necessary cofactor. Mg²⁺ coordinates with ATP within the active site, ensuring proper positioning of the phosphate groups for effective catalysis (meschini2011purinebaseddualinhibitors pages 51-57, wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 2-3).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCDK2 is a serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates substrates involved in cell cycle regulation, and its substrate recognition is influenced by the amino acid context surrounding the phosphoacceptor site. The consensus phosphorylation motif typically requires a serine or threonine residue followed immediately by proline, as frequently observed in CDK substrates such as the retinoblastoma protein (RB) and NPAT; this preference reflects the conserved structural determinants within the kinase domain (pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 15-16, meschini2011purinebaseddualinhibitors pages 29-35). Additional substrate determinants, such as docking motifs (e.g., the RXL motif recognized on the cyclin partner), further contribute to substrate specificity by facilitating proper orientation and binding of target peptides (wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 9-10, pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 8-9).\n\n5. Structure  \nCDK2 is a small protein kinase of approximately 33 kDa that adopts a conserved bilobal structure comprising an N-terminal lobe predominantly consisting of β-sheets and a larger C-terminal lobe rich in α-helices. The active site is located in the cleft between these two lobes and is characterized by conserved motifs such as the glycine-rich loop, the hinge region, and the activation loop that includes the critical threonine 160 (T160) residue (meschini2011purinebaseddualinhibitors pages 45-51, wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 4-5). The N-terminal lobe contributes to ATP binding, while the C-terminal lobe contains the catalytic machinery required for phosphoryl transfer and substrate binding. Upon cyclin binding—most notably to cyclin E during the G1/S transition and cyclin A during S phase—conformational changes are induced that reposition the αC-helix and organize the activation loop into an active conformation (pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 2-4, meschini2011purinebaseddualinhibitors pages 57-64). Structural studies have revealed that the binding interface between CDK2 and its cyclin partners is extensive, ensuring both substrate specificity and optimal catalytic activity; this interface is crucial for the proper alignment of key residues that coordinate ATP binding and phosphate transfer (wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 6-7, pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 49-50).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulatory mechanisms governing CDK2 activity are multifaceted and depend primarily on cyclin association, phosphorylation events, and the binding of specific CDK inhibitors (CKIs). CDK2 requires association with cyclin E in early cell cycle phases and with cyclin A in later phases to achieve full activation; cyclin binding induces significant conformational changes that expose the active site for catalysis (equinet2004studiesonthe pages 51-55, pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 4-5). A critical regulatory step involves phosphorylation of threonine 160 in the activation loop by the CDK-activating kinase (CAK), a complex that comprises CDK7, cyclin H, and MAT1; this phosphorylation stabilizes the active conformation of CDK2 (pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 11-12, wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 10-11). Conversely, inhibitory phosphorylation at residues such as threonine 14 and tyrosine 15 by Wee1 and Myt1 kinases suppresses CDK2 activity, and these inhibitory phosphates are removed by Cdc25 phosphatases to permit full activation (meschini2011purinebaseddualinhibitors pages 51-57, pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 19-20). In addition, binding of endogenous CDK inhibitors from the Cip/Kip family (e.g., p21^Cip1, p27^Kip1, and p57^Kip2) prevents substrate and ATP binding by stabilizing inactive conformations of the CDK2–cyclin complex (pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 7-8, meschini2011purinebaseddualinhibitors pages 35-41).\n\n7. Function  \nCDK2 is a central regulator of the cell cycle whose activity is critical for the G1/S transition and the subsequent progression through S phase and G2 phase. Its activation is essential to initiate DNA synthesis by phosphorylating key substrates such as the retinoblastoma protein (RB), which in turn releases E2F transcription factors that drive the transcription of genes required for DNA replication (pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 50-51, meschini2011purinebaseddualinhibitors pages 57-64). In addition to its canonical role in cell cycle progression, CDK2 is involved in diverse processes including centrosome duplication, homologous recombination–dependent DNA repair, and the modulation of transcription by phosphorylating factors such as NPAT, which in turn activates histone gene transcription during S phase (equinet2004studiesonthe pages 47-51, pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 6-7). In embryonic stem cells, CDK2 contributes to maintaining the delicate balance between proliferation, cell death, and DNA repair, thereby influencing cell fate decisions and pluripotency (pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 8-9, meschini2011purinebaseddualinhibitors pages 64-69). CDK2 also phosphorylates proteins implicated in the DNA damage response, including BRCA2 and NBN, thereby integrating cell cycle regulation with genome stability mechanisms (pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 19-20, meschini2011purinebaseddualinhibitors pages 282-284). Its activity is tightly upregulated during S phase and G2 as it prepares the cell for mitotic entry by controlling the activation of cyclin B/CDK1 complexes (pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 51-51, equinet2004studiesonthe pages 55-58).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral experimental and small molecule inhibitors targeting CDK2 have been developed owing to its critical role in promoting cell proliferation, particularly in cancer cells where CDK2 is frequently dysregulated. Inhibitors targeting the ATP-binding site have been designed to compete with ATP and disrupt kinase activity, and preclinical studies have evaluated dual inhibitors of CDK2 and related kinases such as CDK7 (meschini2011purinebaseddualinhibitors pages 277-280, meschini2011purinebaseddualinhibitors pages 282-284). CDK2 dysregulation is associated with a broad spectrum of cancers including breast, glioblastoma, and colorectal cancers, as well as with defects in meiotic processes leading to infertility (pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 20-20, colas2020cyclindependentkinasesand pages 1-2). Beyond oncogenesis, CDK2 has been linked to the regulation of transcriptional programs through phosphorylation of factors such as MYC and EZH2, which modulate epigenetic gene silencing via H3K27me3 maintenance (pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 50-51, meschini2011purinebaseddualinhibitors pages 45-51). Notable mutations in regulatory regions or phosphorylation sites—such as those affecting the T160 activation loop—have the potential to alter its kinase activity and contribute to disease; however, specific pathogenic mutations in CDK2 are not as frequently reported as alterations in its regulatory partners (meschini2011purinebaseddualinhibitors pages 64-69, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 17-18). Overall, the therapeutic potential of targeting CDK2 in cancer and other proliferative disorders continues to be a significant focus of research, particularly as more selective inhibitors are developed that exploit the highly conserved structural and catalytic features of this kinase (wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 8-9, pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 18-19).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nCyclin‐dependent kinase 3 (CDK3, gene: CDK3/CDKN3; UniProt: Q00526) is classified as a classical cell cycle regulatory CDK and belongs to the CDK1/2/3 subfamily within the human kinome. Phylogenetic analyses using both Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian approaches have demonstrated that CDK3 shares a closer evolutionary relationship with CDK2 than with CDK1, with gene duplication in metazoans ultimately giving rise to distinct CDK1 and CDK2/3 clades. CDK3 orthologs are found in a wide range of metazoan organisms—from basal metazoans such as Amphimedon queenslandica and Trichoplax adhaerens to mammals—reflecting its deep evolutionary origin among eukaryotic cell cycle kinases (cao2014phylogeneticanalysisof pages 3-6, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 1-2). In comparison with unicellular eukaryotes where the ancestral CDK1/2/3 gene remains unduplicated, the metazoan lineage exhibits distinct separation into CDK1 and CDK2/3 clades, thereby situating CDK3 as a conserved component of cell cycle regulation in complex organisms (cao2014phylogeneticanalysisof pages 6-9, liu2000evolutionofcyclindependent pages 3-3).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK3 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to specific serine or threonine residues on target proteins. The general chemical reaction is as follows:  \n  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺  \nThis phosphorylation reaction underpins CDK3’s role in modifying key substrates such as ATF1, RB1, histone H1, and CABLES1 to elicit alterations in their function during cell cycle progression (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of CDK3 is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions, with Mg²⁺ serving as the essential cofactor. Mg²⁺ coordinates with ATP within the active site, facilitating the transfer of the phosphate group to the substrate protein (huwe2003smallmoleculesas pages 1-3).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCDK3 phosphorylates serine/threonine residues within specific protein substrates that modulate cell cycle transitions. Its substrates include histone H1, activating transcription factor 1 (ATF1), retinoblastoma protein (RB1), and CABLES1. Although a detailed consensus motif for CDK3 has not been fully delineated, its substrate specificity mirrors that of other cell cycle CDKs, whereby phosphorylation typically occurs in a context that supports cell cycle progression. In particular, phosphorylation of ATF1 by CDK3 promotes ATF1 transactivation and transcriptional activity, while CDK3-mediated phosphorylation of RB1 is required for the G0-to-G1 transition (peyressatre2015targetingcyclindependentkinases pages 17-19, pluta2024cyclin‐dependentkinasesmasters pages 12-14).\n\n5. Structure  \nCDK3 contains the conserved protein kinase domain typical of classical cyclin-dependent kinases. This domain is organized into an N-terminal lobe primarily composed of α-helices and β-strands and a C-terminal lobe that houses the catalytic machinery. Key structural features include:  \n • The activation loop (T-loop), which requires phosphorylation for full kinase activation.  \n • A conserved DFG motif at the beginning of the activation segment that coordinates both the binding of Mg²⁺ and ATP.  \n • A C-helix that is important for cyclin binding and proper orientation of catalytic residues.  \n • A segment analogous to the canonical PSTAIRE motif found in other cell cycle CDKs, although CDK3 exhibits subtle differences in amino acid composition when compared with CDK2 (shafiq2011molecularmodellingand pages 97-103, endicott2013structuralcharacterizationof pages 3-5).  \n\nAdditionally, CDK3 forms an active complex with cyclin C, which is required for its proper conformational arrangement and catalytic efficiency. Structural studies of related CDKs—supported by crystallographic and AlphaFold models—indicate that the overall fold and spatial arrangement of catalytic elements in CDK3 are highly conserved within the CDK family, ensuring a similar mechanism of action for phosphoryl transfer (wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of CDK3 activity is primarily mediated via its association with cyclin C, an interaction that facilitates the necessary conformational rearrangements for kinase activation. Phosphorylation of specific residues within the activation loop—typically performed by upstream CDK-activating kinases such as CDK7—further promotes full activation of CDK3. Functionally, the cyclin C/CDK3 complex is essential for the phosphorylation of substrates that drive the transition from the quiescent (G0) phase into the G1 phase of the cell cycle. In addition to cyclin binding and phosphorylation, CDK3 activity may be modulated by interactions with specific inhibitors and proteins that affect its stability and localization, although detailed regulatory mechanisms beyond cyclin association and activation phosphorylation have not been extensively characterized (peyressatre2015targetingcyclindependentkinases pages 32-34, chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 4-6).\n\n7. Function  \nCDK3 plays a critical role in the regulation of the eukaryotic cell cycle. Its enzymatic activity is central to the G0–G1 and G1–S transitions. Specifically, CDK3 phosphorylates RB1, which is a prerequisite for releasing E2F transcription factors that are necessary for subsequent DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression. Furthermore, phosphorylation of ATF1 by CDK3 stimulates its transactivation potential, thereby facilitating transcriptional programs that contribute to cell proliferation and, in some contexts, cell transformation. In addition to RB1 and ATF1, CDK3 phosphorylates histone H1 and CABLES1, underscoring its role in chromatin modulation and signal propagation required for cell cycle re-entry from quiescence. The biological activity of CDK3 is thus closely linked to cell cycle control mechanisms and proliferative signaling pathways, and its expression and activation are tightly orchestrated to ensure proper cell division (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 1-2, peyressatre2015targetingcyclindependentkinases pages 17-19, pluta2024cyclin‐dependentkinasesmasters pages 3-5).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nElevated levels of CDK3 activity have been observed in various human cancer cell lines and tissues, including glioblastoma, suggesting a potential role in oncogenic transformation and proliferation. Although selective inhibitors specifically targeting CDK3 have not yet been fully developed, studies have implicated CDK3 as a promising therapeutic target for cancer treatment. Inhibitor efforts targeting other cyclin-dependent kinases have led to the development of compounds with certain selectivities, and similar strategies may eventually yield selective agents for CDK3. Consequently, continued research into the structural nuances and regulatory mechanisms of CDK3 is anticipated to facilitate the design of specific inhibitors that could be effective in controlling cancer progression (peyressatre2015targetingcyclindependentkinases pages 32-34, chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 21-22).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nCyclin‐dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) belongs to the CMGC group of protein kinases and is a member of the cell‐cycle regulatory subfamily that also includes CDK6. CDK4 and CDK6 are absent in yeasts such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and their appearance is associated with the evolution of multicellular organisms. In mammals, CDK4 is found in a distinct evolutionary lineage that diverged from the more ancestral CDC2/CDK1‐like kinases. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that the CDK4/CDK6 subfamily emerged following gene duplication events that occurred after the divergence from unicellular eukaryotes, underscoring their role in the control of the complex cell cycle of metazoans (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 1-2, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 2-3). In addition, comparative studies have demonstrated that CDK4 is evolutionarily related to other serine/threonine kinases through conserved structural features in the catalytic domain and regulatory regions. Its grouping with D‐type cyclin partners and its absence in organisms with a simplified cell cycle regulation further support its specialized role in multicellular organisms (pluta2024cyclin‐dependentkinasesmasters pages 3-5, jacques2023roadmaptothe pages 22-25).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK4 functions as a serine/threonine protein kinase that catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to specific serine or threonine residues on target proteins. The reaction can be summarized as follows: ATP + [protein substrate] → ADP + [protein substrate]-(phospho-serine/threonine) + H⁺. This phosphorylation event often occurs on substrates bearing a proline immediately following the phosphoacceptor residue, consistent with CDK4’s classification as a proline-directed kinase (baker2012cdk4akey pages 2-3).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of CDK4 is dependent on the presence of divalent cations, with Mg²⁺ being the primary cofactor. The magnesium ion coordinates with ATP in the active site to facilitate the proper orientation and transfer of the phosphate group onto substrate proteins. This requirement is characteristic of most kinases in this family, including those within the CMGC group (baker2012cdk4akey pages 2-3).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCDK4 exhibits substrate specificity that is mediated by both its catalytic domain and its association with D‐type cyclins. The kinase phosphorylates proteins whose phosphorylation sites generally conform to a serine or threonine followed immediately by a proline (S/T-P motif). In many cases, optimal substrate phosphorylation occurs when a basic residue is present at the P+3 position relative to the phosphoacceptor site, although CDK4 has been shown to phosphorylate substrates even when these full consensus motifs are not strictly met (anders2011asystematicscreen pages 1-2, suryadinata2010controlofcell pages 5-6). Notably, the retinoblastoma protein (RB1) contains several phosphorylation sites that are targeted by CDK4. These sites, including Ser780 and Ser795, are embedded within sequence environments that allow the formation of a consensus motif necessary for efficient phosphate transfer. The specificity is further refined by cyclin D association, which facilitates substrate docking via RXL- or similar linear motifs, and by additional substrate-binding interactions that promote an ordered phosphorylation cycle (johnson2023anatlasof pages 23-26, harper2001cyclindependentkinases pages 12-13).\n\n5. Structure  \nThe three-dimensional architecture of CDK4 is organized around a typical kinase fold composed of two lobes. The smaller N-terminal lobe consists of a five-stranded β-sheet structure and a conserved C-helix, while the larger C-terminal lobe is predominantly α-helical. The active site is located in the cleft between these two lobes. In crystal structures of CDK4 bound to cyclin D1, CDK4 adopts an inactive, or “intermediate,” conformation even when its T-loop is phosphorylated on Thr172. Structural studies have revealed that, unlike other CDKs such as CDK2 where cyclin association induces a canonical active conformation characterized by a repositioned C-helix and an open activation loop, the CDK4/cyclin D complex maintains an arrangement that does not allow full substrate access (day2009crystalstructureof pages 1-1, takaki2009thestructureof pages 1-1). The crystal structure shows that the cyclin binds predominantly to the N-lobe and interacts with the C-helix through conserved interfaces. Additionally, a modified loop region in CDK4 (used in crystallographic constructs) has been employed to stabilize the overall structure; however, this engineered modification does not significantly alter the overall domain organization. Key structural features include the ATP-binding site, the glycine-rich P-loop, and the activation segment (T-loop), whose conformation is critical for regulating kinase activity. The distinct inactive conformation observed in CDK4 supports the concept that additional regulatory interactions or substrate binding may be required to fully trigger its enzymatic activity (day2009crystalstructureof pages 1-3, takaki2009thestructureof pages 1-3, wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 7-8).\n\n6. Regulation  \nCDK4 regulation is achieved through multiple layers of control that include both post-translational modifications and protein–protein interactions. Phosphorylation of the T-loop residue, Thr172, is essential for catalytic activity, although in isolation this modification does not induce the fully active conformation commonly seen in other kinases (baker2022cdk4amaster pages 1-2, takaki2009thestructureof pages 3-3). Binding of D-type cyclins (D1, D2, or D3) is required to form the CDK4/cyclin complex, and this association is integral to both substrate recognition and activity regulation. Endogenous inhibitors such as the INK4 family proteins—most notably p16INK4A—bind to CDK4 and block its association with cyclin D, thereby inhibiting kinase activity by distorting the active site and preventing proper conformational rearrangements (bockstaele2006regulationofcdk4 pages 1-2, baker2012cdk4akey pages 2-3). In addition, members of the CIP/KIP family, such as p21CIP1 and p27KIP1, interact with already formed CDK-cyclin complexes, acting as modulators that can either inhibit or stabilize the enzyme depending on their phosphorylation state. The interplay between these inhibitors, cyclin binding, and T-loop phosphorylation establishes a finely tuned regulatory system, ensuring that CDK4 activity is tightly controlled during the G1 phase of the cell cycle (baker2022cdk4amaster pages 2-4, hallett2017structuralandfunctional pages 30-34).\n\n7. Function  \nCDK4 plays an essential role in cell-cycle progression by mediating the G1 to S phase transition. In complex with D-type cyclins, CDK4 phosphorylates key substrates such as the retinoblastoma family of proteins (including RB1, p107, and p130), which results in the dissociation of E2F transcription factors from their complexes. This leads to the transcriptional activation of genes required for S-phase entry and DNA replication (anders2011asystematicscreen pages 1-2, baker2012cdk4akey pages 2-3). In early G1 phase, cyclin D-CDK4 complexes hypophosphorylate RB1, setting the stage for subsequent hyperphosphorylation by other kinases (such as cyclin E-CDK2) that effectively inactivate RB-mediated repression. Beyond RB phosphorylation, CDK4 also targets other substrates. For instance, it phosphorylates SMAD3 in a cell-cycle-dependent manner, thereby repressing SMAD3’s transcriptional activity, and it has been implicated in phosphorylating transcription factors such as FOXM1, which plays a role in senescence suppression in cancer cells (anders2011asystematicscreen pages 1-2). The integration of divergent mitogenic and antimitogenic signals by CDK4–cyclin D complexes underlies its status as a major integrator of cell cycle control. This functional role is also supported by observations that mutations affecting CDK4, including those that impair inhibitor binding (for example, mutations at residue R24), lead to increased kinase activity and have been associated with oncogenic phenotypes (sheppard2013thecellcycleregulator pages 1-3, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 5-6).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nCDK4 is a clinically relevant target in oncology due to its pivotal role in cell cycle regulation and the frequent dysregulation of the cyclin D/CDK4/6–RB pathway in various cancers, including melanoma, breast cancer, and renal cell carcinoma (lee2015cdk4inhibitorsan pages 4-6, sager2022therapeuticpotentialof pages 31-34). Several small-molecule inhibitors, such as palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib, have been developed to selectively inhibit CDK4/6 activity by targeting the ATP-binding site, and these inhibitors have shown efficacy in preclinical and clinical settings (sager2022therapeuticpotentialof pages 7-9, sheppard2013thecellcycleregulator pages 1-3). CDK4 inhibitors have demonstrated the capacity to induce G1 cell-cycle arrest and reduce cell proliferation in tumors that depend on this pathway. In addition to kinase inhibition, strategies targeting the chaperone machinery responsible for stabilizing CDK4, such as the HSP90–CDC37 complex, are being explored to promote CDK4 degradation in cancer cells (bockstaele2006regulationofcdk4 pages 1-2, wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 10-11). CDK4 mutations, such as those altering the binding interface for inhibitory proteins like p16, can confer resistance to cell-cycle arrest and contribute to tumorigenesis, further emphasizing the therapeutic importance of developing agents that can effectively target aberrant CDK4 activity (baker2012cdk4akey pages 2-3).\n\n9.

Interacts with D1 and D3-type G1 cyclins. Phosphorylates SRC, NOS3, VIM/vimentin, p35/CDK5R1, MEF2A, SIPA1L1, SH3GLB1, PXN, PAK1, MCAM/MUC18, SEPT5, SYN1, DNM1, AMPH, SYNJ1, CDK16, RAC1, RHOA, CDC42, TONEBP/NFAT5, MAPT/TAU, MAP1B, histone H1, p53/TP53, HDAC1, APEX1, PTK2/FAK1, huntingtin/HTT, ATM, MAP2, NEFH and NEFM. Regulates several neuronal development and physiological processes including neuronal survival, migration and differentiation, axonal and neurite growth, synaptogenesis, oligodendrocyte differentiation, synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission, by phosphorylating key proteins. Negatively regulates the CACNA1B/CAV2.2 -mediated Ca(2+) release probability at hippocampal neuronal soma and synaptic terminals (By similarity). Activated by interaction with CDK5R1 (p35) and CDK5R2 (p39), especially in postmitotic neurons, and promotes CDK5R1 (p35) expression in an autostimulation loop. Phosphorylates many downstream substrates such as Rho and Ras family small GTPases (e.g. PAK1, RAC1, RHOA, CDC42) or microtubule-binding proteins (e.g. MAPT/TAU, MAP2, MAP1B), and modulates actin dynamics to regulate neurite growth and/or spine morphogenesis. Also phosphorylates exocytosis associated proteins such as MCAM/MUC18, SEPT5, SYN1, and CDK16/PCTAIRE1 as well as endocytosis associated proteins such as DNM1, AMPH and SYNJ1 at synaptic terminals. In the mature central nervous system (CNS), regulates neurotransmitter movements by phosphorylating substrates associated with neurotransmitter release and synapse plasticity; synaptic vesicle exocytosis, vesicles fusion with the presynaptic membrane, and endocytosis. Promotes cell survival by activating anti-apoptotic proteins BCL2 and STAT3, and negatively regulating of JNK3/MAPK10 activity. Phosphorylation of p53/TP53 in response to genotoxic and oxidative stresses enhances its stabilization by preventing ubiquitin ligase-mediated proteasomal degradation, and induces transactivation of p53/TP53 target genes, thus regulating apoptosis. Phosphorylation of p35/CDK5R1 enhances its stabilization by preventing calpain-mediated proteolysis producing p25/CDK5R1 and avoiding ubiquitin ligase-mediated proteasomal degradation. During aberrant cell-cycle activity and DNA damage, p25/CDK5 activity elicits cell-cycle activity and double-strand DNA breaks that precedes neuronal death by deregulating HDAC1. DNA damage triggered phosphorylation of huntingtin/HTT in nuclei of neurons protects neurons against polyglutamine expansion as well as DNA damage mediated toxicity. Phosphorylation of PXN reduces its interaction with PTK2/FAK1 in matrix-cell focal adhesions (MCFA) during oligodendrocytes (OLs) differentiation. Negative regulator of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Activator of the GAIT (IFN-gamma-activated inhibitor of translation) pathway, which suppresses expression of a post-transcriptional regulon of proinflammatory genes in myeloid cells; phosphorylates the linker domain of glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS) in a IFN-gamma-dependent manner, the initial event in assembly of the GAIT complex. Phosphorylation of SH3GLB1 is required for autophagy induction in starved neurons. Phosphorylation of TONEBP/NFAT5 in response to osmotic stress mediates its rapid nuclear localization. MEF2 is inactivated by phosphorylation in nucleus in response to neurotoxin, thus leading to neuronal apoptosis. APEX1 AP-endodeoxyribonuclease is repressed by phosphorylation, resulting in accumulation of DNA damage and contributing to neuronal death. NOS3 phosphorylation down regulates NOS3-derived nitrite (NO) levels. SRC phosphorylation mediates its ubiquitin-dependent degradation and thus leads to cytoskeletal reorganization.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nCyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) is a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase family that is evolutionarily distinct from classical cell cycle CDKs and shares sequence homology with kinases such as Pho85 in yeast, reflecting its ancient origin conserved across species in metazoans (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 2-3). CDK5 is ubiquitously expressed; however, its kinase activity is predominantly observed in postmitotic neurons, a feature that distinguishes it from other CDKs that are primarily involved in cell cycle progression (su2011cyclindependentkinasesin pages 1-3). The enzyme belongs to the serine/threonine kinase group and clusters with kinases engaged in neuronal signaling pathways, demonstrating a branched evolution that emphasizes its non-cell cycle regulatory functions (łukasik2021cyclindependentkinases(cdk) pages 2-4). Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses indicate that while the overall catalytic domain is common amongst all CDKs, CDK5 emerged as a unique variant that utilizes neuronal-specific activators rather than cyclins, a divergence that can be traced back to early metazoan evolution (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 6-7). The presence of CDK5 orthologs in a wide range of mammalian species underscores its essential role in the nervous system, and its specialized function is maintained throughout evolution even as other CDKs adapted to govern cell cycle events (openTargets Search: -CDK5).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK5 catalyzes the phosphorylation of protein substrates by transferring the γ-phosphate from ATP to serine or threonine residues present in target proteins, which results in the production of ADP and a phosphorylated protein product (template). This reaction is general for serine/threonine kinases and follows the stoichiometry: ATP + protein‐(L‐serine or L‐threonine) → ADP + protein‐(L‐serine/threonine)‐phosphate + H⁺, illustrating its role in modulating the activity or stability of key substrates (template, shukla2020virtualscreeningpharmacokinetics pages 1-5).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of CDK5 requires divalent metal ion cofactors, with Mg²⁺ being essential for its kinase function since it facilitates the binding and proper orientation of ATP in the active site (template). This requirement for Mg²⁺ is a conserved trait among serine/threonine kinases and ensures efficient catalysis during the phosphorylation reaction (template, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 6-7).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCDK5 exhibits proline-directed serine/threonine kinase activity and demonstrates substrate specificity for sequences where the phosphorylated serine or threonine is immediately followed by a proline residue, often within the context of a consensus motif such as S/TPXK/R (sharma1999identificationofsubstrate pages 1-2). In addition, CDK5’s substrate recognition is modulated by its unique interactions with regulatory activators, which influence substrate selection toward proteins that play a pivotal role in neuronal function, including the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT), neurofilaments, and other cytoskeletal components (dhariwala2008anunusualmember pages 1-3, su2011cyclindependentkinasesin pages 3-5). The enzyme phosphorylates a broad range of substrates involved in controlling cytoskeletal dynamics, synaptic vesicle trafficking, and signal transduction pathways, which often include basic amino acids at positions near the phosphoacceptor site that contribute to optimal substrate binding (cheung2012cdk5amultifaceted pages 4-6, mapelli2005mechanismofcdk5p25 pages 1-2). The specificity is further refined by the spatial and temporal regulation provided by CDK5’s activator proteins such as p35 and p39, ensuring that phosphorylation events occur primarily within the neuronal context (dhariwala2008anunusualmember pages 3-5).\n\n5. Structure  \nCDK5 possesses a canonical kinase fold that comprises a small N-terminal lobe rich in β-sheets and a larger C-terminal lobe that is predominantly α-helical, similar to other members of the CDK family, but with unique regulatory features (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 3-5). The activation loop within its catalytic domain, although structurally analogous to those of other CDKs, does not require phosphorylation by CDK-activating kinase (CAK) for full activation, because the binding of activators p35 or p39 induces a conformational change that stabilizes the active state (dhariwala2008anunusualmember pages 3-5, mapelli2005mechanismofcdk5p25 pages 8-9). A glycine-rich loop, which plays a critical role in ATP binding, is also present and is similar to those found in other serine/threonine kinases, yet CDK5’s overall surface topology is altered by its association with neuron-specific regulatory partners (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 5-6). The three-dimensional organization of CDK5 includes regions that mediate binding to activators; these regulatory proteins interact with the kinase via a cyclin-box domain-like interface that is distinct from the classical cyclins that activate other CDKs (su2011cyclindependentkinasesin pages 7-9, peyressatre2015targetingcyclindependentkinases pages 4-6). Unique structural features of CDK5 include the absence or altered function of inhibitory phosphorylation sites that are commonly observed in cell cycle CDKs, and its catalytic core is optimized to interact with p35 or p39 rather than relying on phosphorylation-induced conformational changes (dhariwala2008anunusualmember pages 8-11, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 6-7).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulatory mechanisms governing CDK5 activity are complex and involve multiple layers of post-translational modifications and protein–protein interactions. Notably, CDK5 is activated upon binding to its neuron-specific activators p35 and p39, which, unlike cyclins, confer spatial and temporal regulation of the kinase in postmitotic neurons (dhariwala2008anunusualmember pages 1-3, su2011cyclindependentkinasesin pages 1-3). A critical regulatory event is the proteolytic cleavage of p35 by the calcium-dependent protease calpain, which produces p25; this truncated fragment binds CDK5 with higher stability and leads to prolonged, hyperactive kinase activity that has been linked to pathological conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease (dhariwala2008anunusualmember pages 11-13, mapelli2005mechanismofcdk5p25 pages 8-9). CDK5 also undergoes autoregulatory phosphorylation events that modulate its substrate affinity and stability, with phosphorylation of p35 by CDK5 itself contributing to a negative feedback loop that regulates the turnover of the activator (dhariwala2008anunusualmember pages 13-15, su2011cyclindependentkinasesin pages 21-23). Additional layers of regulation include the modulation of CDK5 activity by several interacting proteins and substrates, such as p53, HDAC1, and members of the Rho and Ras family small GTPases, which further influence its kinase activity in stress responses and during neuronal development (cheung2012cdk5amultifaceted pages 4-6, peyressatre2015targetingcyclindependentkinases pages 15-17). Allosteric regulation through conformational changes upon binding of regulatory partners is central to controlling CDK5’s enzymatic activity and substrate specificity, making its regulation highly context-dependent (łukasik2021cyclindependentkinases(cdk) pages 23-25).\n\n7. Function  \nCDK5 plays a pivotal role in the nervous system, where it is essential for neuronal cell cycle arrest and differentiation; it functions by phosphorylating a wide array of proteins involved in neuronal migration, neurite outgrowth, axonal guidance, synaptogenesis, and synaptic plasticity (dhariwala2008anunusualmember pages 1-3, su2011cyclindependentkinasesin pages 7-9). CDK5 phosphorylates substrates such as tau (MAPT), neurofilament proteins, and microtubule-associated proteins including MAP1B and MAP2, thereby modulating cytoskeletal dynamics critical for neurite extension and maintenance of neuronal architecture (dhariwala2008anunusualmember pages 6-8, shukla2020virtualscreeningpharmacokinetics pages 1-5). In addition to its classical roles in neuronal development, CDK5 also phosphorylates proteins involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis and endocytosis—for instance, synapsin-1, dynamin-1, amphiphysin, and synaptojanin-1—thereby regulating neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity (peyressatre2015targetingcyclindependentkinases pages 6-8, su2011cyclindependentkinasesin pages 7-9). Beyond neuronal functions, CDK5 has been implicated in non-neuronal processes such as the regulation of endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis, where it influences lamellipodia formation and the activation of small GTPases like Rac1, pointing to a broader role in cell motility and tissue remodeling (liebl2010cyclindependentkinase5 pages 1-2, łukasik2021cyclindependentkinases(cdk) pages 29-30). CDK5 modulates apoptotic pathways through the phosphorylation of p53, promoting its stabilization and activation of target genes that lead to cell death under conditions of genotoxic stress, thereby linking kinase activity to the control of neuronal survival (dhariwala2008anunusualmember pages 13-15, su2011cyclindependentkinasesin pages 5-6). Moreover, the kinase plays an integral role in circadian regulation by modulating the activity and subcellular localization of CLOCK protein via phosphorylation, which contributes to the precise regulation of circadian rhythms (dhariwala2008anunusualmember pages 6-8, peyressatre2015targetingcyclindependentkinases pages 27-30). The interactome of CDK5 is extensive, including interactions with proteins involved in cytoskeletal reorganization (e.g., vimentin, paxillin), small GTPases (e.g., RAC1, RHOA, CDC42), and transcription factors such as MEF2, underscoring its multifaceted role in orchestrating diverse signaling pathways in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells (dhariwala2008anunusualmember pages 1-3, łukasik2021cyclindependentkinases(cdk) pages 30-31).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral small molecule inhibitors have been identified as modulators of CDK5 activity, with roscovitine being one of the most widely used experimental inhibitors that targets the ATP-binding site of CDK5 (peyressatre2015targetingcyclindependentkinases pages 4-6). The abnormal hyperactivation of CDK5, especially due to the formation of the p25/CDK5 complex, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, making CDK5 a prominent therapeutic target (dhariwala2008anunusualmember pages 11-13, cheung2012cdk5amultifaceted pages 4-6). In addition, mutations or dysregulation of CDK5 activity have been associated with aberrant cell cycle re-entry in neurons, which may lead to apoptotic cell death and contribute to neurodegeneration (dhariwala2008anunusualmember pages 3-5, su2011cyclindependentkinasesin pages 21-23). CDK5 is also noted to interact with various proteins that modulate inflammatory responses and DNA damage repair pathways, such as APEX1 and HDAC1, linking its activity to the regulation of cellular stress responses (peyressatre2015targetingcyclindependentkinases pages 15-17, clare2001thecyclindependentkinases pages 3-5). Furthermore, recent proteomic studies have expanded the known CDK5 interactome by identifying novel binding partners in non-neuronal cells, indicating roles in cell growth and migration beyond its classical neuronal functions (xu2014proteomicanalysisof pages 1-2, łukasik2021cyclindependentkinases(cdk) pages 4-5).

Phosphorylates pRB/RB1 and NPM1. Interacts with D-type G1 cyclins during interphase at G1 to form a pRB/RB1 kinase and controls the entrance into the cell cycle. Involved in initiation and maintenance of cell cycle exit during cell differentiation; prevents cell proliferation and negatively regulates cell differentiation, but is required for the proliferation of specific cell types (e.g. erythroid and hematopoietic cells). Essential for cell proliferation within the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles. Required during thymocyte development. Promotes the production of newborn neurons, probably by modulating G1 length. Promotes, at least in astrocytes, changes in patterns of gene expression, changes in the actin cytoskeleton including loss of stress fibers, and enhanced motility during cell differentiation. Prevents myeloid differentiation by interfering with RUNX1 and reducing its transcription transactivation activity, but promotes proliferation of normal myeloid progenitors. Delays senescence. Promotes the proliferation of beta-cells in pancreatic islets of Langerhans.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nCDK6 belongs to the cyclin‐dependent kinase (CDK) family, a group of serine/threonine kinases that evolved from a single ancestral kinase present in lower eukaryotes and expanded in metazoans into multiple members with specialized roles. In particular, CDK6 is a member of the CDK4/6 subfamily, which is found exclusively in eumetazoans and is evolutionarily more relevant for controlling cell cycle entry in higher organisms (asghar2015thehistoryand pages 1-2, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 2-3). Orthologs of CDK6 are known to exist in all mammalian species, and phylogenetic analyses using the complete human kinome have assigned CDK6 to the CMGC group, sharing significant overall sequence and functional similarity with other cell-cycle kinases such as CDK4 and CDK1 (fassl2022cdk4andcdk6 pages 1-3, malumbres2005mammaliancyclindependentkinases pages 1-2). The evolutionary expansion of the CDK family from yeast to man further underlines the specialized regulatory functions that CDK6 has acquired, notably in the transition through the G1 phase and in the coordination of differentiation-specific processes (asghar2015thehistoryand pages 1-2, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 8-9).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK6 catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. The canonical reaction can be described as: ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (huwe2003smallmoleculesas pages 1-3). This enzymatic process is central to cell cycle control since phosphorylation of substrates such as the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) alleviates transcriptional repression and permits cell cycle progression (asghar2015thehistoryand pages 9-10).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of CDK6 requires the presence of divalent metal ions, with Mg²⁺ serving as a critical cofactor for the binding of ATP, which is necessary for catalysis. The typical dependence on Mg²⁺ is consistent with the requirements for the entire family of serine/threonine kinases (huwe2003smallmoleculesas pages 1-3).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCDK6 exhibits substrate specificity that is largely determined by its association with D-type cyclins, which modulate its affinity for substrates and help define the context in which it phosphorylates proteins. Its best‐characterized substrates include Rb, as well as other proteins such as NPM1, where the phosphorylation events occur predominantly on serine and threonine residues adjacent to proline residues. Although no exclusive consensus motif is provided in the current context, the overall serine/threonine–proline preference is typical for CDKs (asghar2015thehistoryand pages 9-10, huwe2003smallmoleculesas pages 1-3). Additional substrate specificity is conferred by the cyclin partner, which may alter the conformational landscape of the active site to favor phosphorylation of particular substrates involved in cell cycle regulation (fassl2022cdk4andcdk6 pages 3-4, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 3-5).\n\n5. Structure  \nCDK6 displays the canonical bilobal structure characteristic of protein kinases, with an N-terminal lobe that is rich in β-sheets and contains a glycine-rich loop critical for ATP binding, and a larger C-terminal lobe composed mainly of α-helices that houses the catalytic machinery. The structures obtained by homology modeling and experimental crystallography of related kinases (e.g., CDK2 and structures of CDK6 bound to viral cyclins) suggest that CDK6 contains key structural features such as the highly conserved ATP-binding pocket, an activation loop that is subject to phosphorylation, and a C-helix whose orientation is critical for catalytic activity (ferrer2006structuralbasisfor pages 3-4, wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2). Furthermore, the binding of D-type cyclins to CDK6 significantly reorganizes its conformation by stabilizing the active site and aligning the catalytic residues for phosphotransfer. Unique structural aspects of CDK6, when compared with closely related kinases such as CDK4, include differences in the solvent exposure of the C-terminal lobe and distinct interfaces for binding specific inhibitors and regulatory proteins like p16^INK4A (fassl2022cdk4andcdk6 pages 1-3, ferrer2006structuralbasisfor pages 5-6). These features provide both the functional flexibility necessary for its role in cell proliferation and opportunities for the development of selective therapeutic inhibitors.\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe activity of CDK6 is tightly regulated by multiple mechanisms that ensure proper cell cycle progression and cellular differentiation. First, the binding of D-type cyclins is essential for CDK6 activation; these cyclins are induced by mitogenic signals and form holoenzyme complexes with CDK6 during the G1 phase (asghar2015thehistoryand pages 1-2, fassl2022cdk4andcdk6 pages 1-3). Additionally, the kinase is subject to activation loop phosphorylation by CDK-activating kinases (CAK), which further enhances its catalytic activity (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 5-6). CDK6 is negatively regulated by the binding of INK4 family inhibitors, such as p16^INK4A, which block cyclin association and induce conformational changes that inhibit ATP binding (sausville2002complexitiesinthe pages 1-2, sielecki2000cyclindependentkinaseinhibitors pages 5-6). Moreover, members of the Cip/Kip family—p21^Cip1 and p27^Kip1—can bind to preformed cyclin D–CDK6 complexes, affecting substrate recruitment and, in some instances, serving as both inhibitors and assembly factors depending on their phosphorylation state (fassl2022cdk4andcdk6 pages 3-4, peyressatre2015targetingcyclindependentkinases pages 27-30). These multiple layers of regulation ensure that CDK6 activity is coordinated with the cell’s proliferative status and differentiation cues (asghar2015thehistoryand pages 9-10, malumbres2011physiologicalrelevanceof pages 3-4).\n\n7. Function  \nCDK6 plays several critical roles in cellular processes, primarily related to the control of the cell cycle and differentiation. As a serine/threonine kinase, CDK6 promotes the G1/S transition by phosphorylating key substrates such as the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), leading to the release of E2F transcription factors that trigger the expression of genes required for DNA replication (asghar2015thehistoryand pages 9-10, suryadinata2010controlofcell pages 3-4). Beyond its canonical role in cell cycle progression, CDK6 is involved in various tissue-specific processes. It is essential for the proliferation of hematopoietic cells, erythroid progenitors, beta-cells in pancreatic islets, and neuronal progenitors in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone (information section; sherr2016targetingcdk4and pages 1-2). In the context of differentiation, CDK6 participates not only in initiating cell cycle exit but also in maintaining specific differentiation programs by modulating gene expression and cytoskeletal organization, for instance in astrocytes where changes in the actin cytoskeleton and enhanced cellular motility are observed (information section; malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 6-7). CDK6 also interacts with, and in some cases negatively regulates, transcription factors such as RUNX1, thereby preventing myeloid differentiation while promoting the proliferation of normal progenitor cells (information section; malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 8-9). These context-dependent roles underscore the importance of CDK6 in both promoting proliferation when required and in orchestrating appropriate cell cycle exit during differentiation.\n\n8. Other Comments  \nCDK6 is a prominent target in oncology due to its frequent dysregulation in various cancers, where its overexpression or hyperactivation leads to uncontrolled cell proliferation (asghar2015thehistoryand pages 9-10, peyressatre2015targetingcyclindependentkinases pages 15-17). Selective inhibitors such as palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib are clinically approved agents that target the ATP-binding pocket of CDK6 to prevent Rb phosphorylation and induce G1 phase arrest (sherr2016targetingcdk4and pages 1-2, tadesse2018cyclindependentkinase2 pages 18-23). In addition to cancer, CDK6 has been implicated in other physiological contexts such as thymocyte development and the regulation of cell senescence, as well as in the organization of the centrosome during the cell cycle (information section; suryadinata2010controlofcell pages 9-10). The structural features unique to CDK6 relative to other CDKs provide opportunities for the rational design of inhibitors that exhibit high selectivity, thereby minimizing off-target effects (wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 6-7, ferrer2006structuralbasisfor pages 5-6). Moreover, the dual role of CDK6 in both cell cycle promotion and transcriptional regulation highlights its potential as a multifaceted therapeutic target (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 8-9, peyressatre2015targetingcyclindependentkinases pages 6-8).\n\n9.

Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are activated by the binding to a cyclin and mediate the progression through the cell cycle. Each different complex controls a specific transition between 2 subsequent phases in the cell cycle. Required for both activation and complex formation of CDK1/cyclin-B during G2-M transition, and for activation of CDK2/cyclins during G1-S transition (but not complex formation). CDK7 is the catalytic subunit of the CDK-activating kinase (CAK) complex. Phosphorylates SPT5/SUPT5H, SF1/NR5A1, POLR2A, p53/TP53, CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, CDK6 and CDK11B/CDK11. CAK activates the cyclin-associated kinases CDK1, CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6 by threonine phosphorylation, thus regulating cell cycle progression. CAK complexed to the core-TFIIH basal transcription factor activates RNA polymerase II by serine phosphorylation of the repetitive C-terminal domain (CTD) of its large subunit (POLR2A), allowing its escape from the promoter and elongation of the transcripts (PubMed:9852112). Phosphorylation of POLR2A in complex with DNA promotes transcription initiation by triggering dissociation from DNA. Its expression and activity are constant throughout the cell cycle. Upon DNA damage, triggers p53/TP53 activation by phosphorylation, but is inactivated in turn by p53/TP53; this feedback loop may lead to an arrest of the cell cycle and of the transcription, helping in cell recovery, or to apoptosis. Required for DNA-bound peptides-mediated transcription and cellular growth inhibition**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nCyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) is a serine/threonine kinase that belongs to the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) family, which is a specialized subgroup within the larger CMGC group of protein kinases. CDK7 is evolutionarily conserved across eukaryotic organisms, with orthologs identified from yeast to mammals, indicating its indispensable role in fundamental cellular processes. Its presence in diverse species underscores that during evolution, CDK7 maintained a dual functionality: on one hand, it plays a central role in regulating cell cycle progression by activating partner CDKs, and on the other, it contributes to the control of RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription when integrated into the basal transcription machinery. In mammals, CDK7 is best known as the catalytic subunit of the CDK-activating kinase (CAK) complex, which is crucial not only for the phosphorylation and subsequent activation of cell cycle CDKs such as CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6 but also for coordinating the transcription process through its association with the TFIIH complex. These phylogenetic characteristics, along with its conserved catalytic domain and regulatory mechanisms, firmly establish CDK7 as a member of an evolutionarily ancient kinase family that has expanded to mediate both cell division and transcription regulation (hunter2015theeukaryoticprotein pages 1-3, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK7 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to a target substrate protein, following the canonical phosphorylation reaction typical for serine/threonine kinases. The reaction mechanism involves the binding of ATP and a specific protein substrate into the kinase active site, where CDK7 facilitates the transfer of the γ-phosphate of ATP to a serine or threonine residue on the substrate. The overall chemical reaction can be represented as:  \nATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺.  \nThis reaction is fundamental to the activation and regulation of many proteins, as phosphorylation can induce conformational changes that modulate the activity, interaction, or localization of the substrate proteins (alexander2008rolesformotifs pages 4-9).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of CDK7, in line with other serine/threonine kinases, is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ion cofactors. Mg²⁺ ions are absolutely required to coordinate the phosphate groups of ATP within the active site of the enzyme. By binding to ATP, Mg²⁺ helps to position the γ-phosphate group optimally for the subsequent nucleophilic attack by the hydroxyl group of the serine or threonine residue on the substrate, ensuring efficient catalysis of the phosphorylation reaction (alexander2008rolesformotifs pages 4-9).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCDK7 exhibits a defined substrate specificity that is central to its roles in both cell cycle regulation and transcription initiation. One major substrate group comprises the cyclin-dependent kinases themselves, such as CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6. CDK7 phosphorylates a conserved threonine residue within the activation loop (T-loop) of these kinases, a modification that is required for their full activation and proper progression of cell cycle transitions, including critical events at the G1-S and G2-M boundaries.  \nAnother prominent substrate of CDK7 is the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) largest subunit, POLR2A. POLR2A contains multiple repeats of a heptapeptide consensus sequence (Y₁S₂P₃T₄S₅P₆S₇) in its C-terminal domain (CTD). CDK7 preferentially targets the serine residues within these repeats, with Ser5 phosphorylation being especially critical for promoting promoter clearance and transcription initiation. Additional substrates include transcription elongation factors such as SPT5/SUPT5H and splicing factors such as SF1/NR5A1, as well as the tumor suppressor p53 (TP53). Although a detailed consensus motif for CDK7 has not been fully refined, available high-throughput substrate profiling indicates that the enzyme prefers phosphorylation in motifs where a serine residue is followed by proline (as often seen in the Pol II CTD) and in regions with defined structural context that enable efficient kinase docking (johnson2023anatlasof pages 6-7, alrawi2023cyclinaand pages 32-35).\n\n5. Structure  \nCDK7 is characterized by a central protein kinase domain that adopts the classical bilobal architecture typical of eukaryotic kinases. The N-terminal lobe, predominantly composed of β-sheets along with a critical αC-helix, cooperates with a more extensive C-terminal lobe that is largely helical. The ATP binding site is located at the interface between these lobes, while key catalytic residues, including a conserved aspartate located in the catalytic loop, function as the catalytic base. The enzyme also contains an activation loop (T-loop) whose phosphorylation is essential for attaining full kinase activity.  \nWithin the cellular context, CDK7 does not act as a solitary enzyme; instead, it is assembled into the multisubunit CDK-activating kinase (CAK) complex along with cyclin H and MAT1. Cyclin H binding is known to induce conformational rearrangements that properly align the catalytic machinery, while MAT1 further stabilizes the interacting complex and influences substrate orientation. Crystallographic studies have revealed distinctive features in CDK7’s structure, including a well-defined C-helix that plays a role in the organization of its active site and a hydrophobic spine that helps to connect the N-terminal and C-terminal lobes, collectively ensuring precise substrate accommodation and catalytic efficiency. These structural elements underpin the enzyme’s dual functionality in activating other CDKs and in phosphorylating the Pol II CTD as part of the TFIIH complex (duster2024structuralbasisof pages 1-4, hunter2015theeukaryoticprotein pages 3-6, lolli2004thecrystalstructure pages 12-13).\n\n6. Regulation  \nCDK7 is regulated through multiple interrelated mechanisms that ensure its precise control during cell proliferation and transcription initiation. A primary mode of regulation is its assembly into the CAK complex, where binding to cyclin H and MAT1 is essential for the proper folding, activation, and substrate recognition of CDK7. The interaction with cyclin H induces conformational changes that not only bring catalytic residues into optimum alignment but also contribute to the opening of the active site. MAT1 further reinforces this activated conformation and may play a role in determining substrate specificity by influencing the overall structure of the complex.  \nPost-translational modifications are also critical in regulating CDK7 activity. Phosphorylation of the activation loop (T-loop) is necessary for the full activation of the enzyme, as this modification stabilizes the active conformation required for substrate binding and catalysis. Under conditions of DNA damage, CDK7 phosphorylates the tumor suppressor p53, which becomes activated and subsequently participates in a feedback loop by inhibiting CDK7 activity. This regulatory feedback mechanism is integral to the DNA damage response, resulting in cell cycle arrest or the initiation of apoptosis when genotoxic stress is detected. The combined effects of complex assembly and phosphorylation events ensure that CDK7 activity is maintained at a constant level throughout the cell cycle while being capable of rapid modulation in response to cellular stress signals (alexander2008rolesformotifs pages 90-94, alrawi2023cyclinaand pages 6-8, fisher2005secretsofa pages 4-5, fisher2017cdkregulationof pages 11-14).\n\n7. Function  \nCDK7 plays a dual, central role in cell biology by integrating the control of cell cycle progression with the regulation of transcription. First, as the catalytic subunit of the CAK complex, CDK7 phosphorylates and thereby activates critical cyclin-dependent kinases such as CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6. This activation via T-loop phosphorylation is indispensable for proper cell cycle transitions, including the switch from G1 to S phase and progression through G2 and mitosis. Interruptions in these phosphorylation events result in aberrant cell cycle progression, underscoring the importance of CDK7 in cell division control.  \nSecond, CDK7 is a key regulator of transcription initiation as a component of the TFIIH basal transcription factor complex. In this role, CDK7 phosphorylates the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II, particularly at Ser5 residues within the repeated heptad motif of POLR2A. This phosphorylation event triggers the release of RNA polymerase II from the promoter, allowing it to escape into productive transcript elongation. In addition to its central roles in activating other CDKs and the transcription machinery, CDK7 phosphorylates several other substrates, including elongation factors such as SPT5/SUPT5H, splicing regulators such as SF1/NR5A1, and the tumor suppressor p53, thereby linking transcription with the cellular response to DNA damage. Collectively, these functions ensure that the mechanisms driving cell division and gene expression are tightly coordinated to sustain cellular proliferation and maintain genome integrity (alrawi2023cyclinaand pages 1-3, aquino2022newmolecularmechanisms pages 24-27, johnson2023anatlasof pages 9-10, parsons2005comparativeanalysisof pages 14-15).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nDue to its central role in both cell cycle progression and transcription regulation, CDK7 has emerged as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention, particularly in the context of cancer. Selective inhibitors of CDK7, such as THZ1, have been developed and are currently the subject of extensive preclinical evaluation. These inhibitors act by impeding CDK7’s ability to phosphorylate its downstream targets, which disrupts the normal activation of other CDKs as well as the phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II CTD, ultimately leading to impaired cell cycle progression and transcriptional dysregulation. Additionally, the regulatory feedback loop in which CDK7 activates p53, and p53 in turn downregulates CDK7 activity, highlights the enzyme’s involvement in the cellular response to DNA damage. Although explicit disease-associated mutations in CDK7 have not been detailed in the available data, dysregulation of its kinase activity has been implicated in tumorigenesis. As research advances, further insights into its structural and regulatory nuances may foster the development of even more potent and selective inhibitors for clinical use (ramani2020structuralmotifsfor pages 46-53, pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 49-49, pellarin2025cyclindependentproteinkinases pages 51-52).\n\n9.

Promotes RNA synthesis in genetic programs for cell growth, differentiation and viral pathogenesis (PubMed:10393184, PubMed:11112772). P-TEFb is also involved in cotranscriptional histone modification, mRNA processing and mRNA export (PubMed:15564463, PubMed:19575011, PubMed:19844166). Modulates a complex network of chromatin modifications including histone H2B monoubiquitination (H2Bub1), H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and H3K36me3; integrates phosphorylation during transcription with chromatin modifications to control co-transcriptional histone mRNA processing (PubMed:15564463, PubMed:19575011, PubMed:19844166).

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nCyclin‐dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) is a member of the serine/threonine protein kinase family that has evolved as part of the transcriptional regulatory subgroup of CDKs. CDK9 is highly conserved across eukaryotes, with orthologs identified in mammals, basal metazoans, fungi, and even some unicellular lineages, reflecting its ancient origin and preserved function in transcription regulation (cao2014phylogeneticanalysisof pages 1-2, paparidis2017theemergingpicture pages 6-8). Evolutionary analyses classify CDK9 in the transcriptional CDK group alongside kinases such as CDK7, CDK8, CDK11, CDK12, and CDK13, and phylogenetic studies indicate that CDK9 is most closely related to CDK12 and CDK13, sharing significant sequence identity in their catalytic domains (malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 2-3, paparidis2017theemergingpicture pages 6-8). The kinase has also been compared to its yeast counterpart, Bur1, which underscores its origin prior to the divergence of yeast and animal lineages (cao2014phylogeneticanalysisof pages 3-6, napolitano2002roleofcyclintcdk9 pages 1-2). In the context of the kinome, CDK9 is firmly placed within the group of transcriptional regulators that are part of an evolutionary core of kinases present even in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) (cao2014phylogeneticanalysisof pages 6-9, gorman2020phylogeneticanalysisof pages 3-4).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK9 catalyzes the ATP‐dependent phosphorylation of specific serine/threonine residues on target proteins. The canonical reaction can be summarized as follows:  \n  ATP + [protein]‐(L‐serine/threonine) → ADP + [protein]‐(L‐serine/threonine)‐phosphate + H⁺  \nIn cellular contexts, CDK9 phosphorylates the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II), which contains heptad repeats; this phosphorylation (predominantly on serine 2 residues) is essential for the transition from transcription initiation to productive elongation. In addition, CDK9 phosphorylates other substrates such as DSIF, NELF, EP300, MYOD1, and the androgen receptor (AR) to modulate their function in transcription and chromatin modification (adderley2022comparativeanalysisof pages 7-9, napolitano2002roleofcyclintcdk9 pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe enzymatic activity of CDK9 is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions, with Mg²⁺ being required as a cofactor. Mg²⁺ coordinates the phosphate groups of ATP within the active site, thus allowing for proper substrate positioning and efficient phosphoryl transfer (baumli2008thestructureof pages 1-2, paparidis2017theemergingpicture pages 6-8).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCDK9 exhibits substrate specificity that is largely determined by its catalytic domain structure and the conformations of its active and substrate binding sites. The kinase displays a preference for phosphorylating serine/threonine residues followed immediately by a proline (S/T-P motif) found in substrates such as the RNA polymerase II CTD. This specificity is enforced by a hydrophobic pocket that accommodates a proline residue adjacent to the phosphorylation site and is similar to the substrate recognition observed in other cyclin-dependent kinases (echalier2010recentdevelopmentsin pages 5-7, anshabo2021cdk9acomprehensive pages 2-4). Additionally, CDK9 recognizes substrates that bear specific post-translational modifications or secondary structural elements, which further refine its selectivity towards components involved in transcriptional elongation and co-transcriptional processes (bacon2019cdk9asignaling pages 3-4).\n\n5. Structure  \nCDK9 is characterized by a highly conserved kinase domain of approximately 250–300 amino acids that adopts a bilobal tertiary structure. The smaller N-terminal lobe, composed primarily of beta sheets and one alpha helix (specifically the αC helix), is responsible for binding to cyclin partners such as cyclin T1, with the interaction largely mediated through a conserved PITALRE motif. The larger C-terminal lobe, predominantly composed of alpha helices with interspersed beta strands, houses the ATP binding site in a cleft between the two lobes. Within this cleft, key residues such as Asp104 and Cys106—located in the hinge region—as well as Asp167 (within the DFG motif) play critical roles in coordination of ATP and catalysis (anshabo2021cdk9acomprehensive pages 2-4, baumli2008thestructureof pages 1-2).  \nActivation of CDK9 is closely linked to the phosphorylation of its activation loop, in particular at Thr186, which can occur via auto-phosphorylation or be mediated by upstream kinases such as CDK7. This phosphorylation event induces a conformational change that stabilizes the active site, promotes substrate binding, and facilitates interactions with cyclin T1 (mandal2021targetingcdk9for pages 29-30, baumli2008thestructureof pages 10-11). Furthermore, the structural arrangement of the cyclin binding interface in CDK9 is distinct from that in cell cycle CDKs, featuring a rotation of the cyclin subunit relative to the kinase domain that results in a smaller interface area; this unique orientation is thought to contribute to the precise regulation and substrate specificity observed in transcriptional regulation (bacon2019cdk9asignaling pages 1-3, krystof2010pharmacologicaltargetingof pages 7-8).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulatory mechanisms that control CDK9 activity are multifaceted and include several levels of post-translational modifications as well as interactions with regulatory protein complexes. A critical regulatory step is the phosphorylation of the T-loop at Thr186, which is necessary for full kinase activation. This phosphorylation event stabilizes the enzyme’s active conformation and is essential for productive binding to cyclin T1; mutations in Thr186 result in severely compromised kinase activity (mandal2021targetingcdk9for pages 4-5, anshabo2021cdk9acomprehensive pages 4-6).  \nIn addition to T-loop phosphorylation, CDK9 function is modulated by its sequestration within the 7SK snRNP complex. In its inactive form, CDK9 is bound to 7SK small nuclear RNA and inhibitory proteins such as HEXIM1, which prevent premature or unscheduled phosphorylation activity. Release from this inhibitory complex is mediated by various cellular signals and post-translational modifications, thereby enabling CDK9 to join its cognate cyclin T1 in the formation of the active positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) complex (adderley2022comparativeanalysisof pages 7-9, brasier2008perspectiveexpandingrole pages 1-2). Other regulatory inputs include phosphorylation at additional sites within CDK9 (such as Ser175) that further modulate its interaction with substrates and regulatory partners, as well as acetylation events on cyclin T1 that affect the stability and release of P-TEFb from the 7SK complex (anshabo2021cdk9acomprehensive pages 9-11). The dynamic interplay of these modifications provides a complex network that finely tunes CDK9 activity in response to cellular conditions.\n\n7. Function  \nCDK9 plays a central role in the regulation of mRNA transcription by RNA polymerase II. As the catalytic subunit of the P-TEFb complex, CDK9 phosphorylates the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAP II, specifically on Ser2 residues within the heptad repeats, thereby facilitating the transition from transcription initiation to productive elongation. This phosphorylation event also promotes the recruitment of RNA processing factors, cotranscriptional histone modifications, and mRNA export complexes, contributing to coordinated gene expression (adderley2022comparativeanalysisof pages 7-9, napolitano2002roleofcyclintcdk9 pages 1-2).  \nAdditionally, CDK9 phosphorylates negative elongation factors such as DSIF and NELF, alleviating their inhibitory effects and further enabling efficient transcription elongation (bacon2019cdk9asignaling pages 1-3, papardis2017theemergingpicture pages 1-2). Beyond its canonical role in transcription, CDK9 phosphorylates other substrates including EP300, MYOD1, and the androgen receptor (AR), thereby impacting diverse transcription programs involved in cell growth, differentiation, and viral pathogenesis. The phosphorylation of MYOD1, for example, enhances its transcriptional activity and promotes muscle differentiation, while AR phosphorylation influences promoter selectivity and cell proliferation (anshabo2021cdk9acomprehensive pages 9-11, napolitano2002roleofcyclintcdk9 pages 1-2).  \nCDK9 activity also has ramifications in the DNA damage response and replication stress. In complex with cyclin K, CDK9 contributes to genome integrity maintenance by promoting cell cycle recovery following replication arrest and by limiting the accumulation of single-stranded DNA, thereby preventing the collapse of stalled replication forks and reducing DNA damage (adderley2022comparativeanalysisof pages 7-9). Furthermore, CDK9-mediated phosphorylation is involved in co-transcriptional histone modifications—including histone H2B monoubiquitination, H3 lysine 4 trimethylation, and H3K36 trimethylation—which integrate transcription with chromatin structure and function (adderley2022comparativeanalysisof pages 7-9).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral small molecule inhibitors targeting CDK9 have been developed and are in various stages of preclinical and clinical evaluation, particularly in the context of cancer treatment. Flavopiridol, one of the first CDK9 inhibitors tested in clinical trials, competes with ATP for binding to the kinase and has demonstrated efficacy in various malignancies, including acute leukemias and solid tumors (huang2022cdk9inhibitorsin pages 1-2, krystof2010pharmacologicaltargetingof pages 7-8). Other selective inhibitors such as BAY 1251152, VIP152, and SNS-032 have shown promise in early clinical studies, while emerging compounds are being developed with improved specificity and reduced toxicity (mandal2021targetingcdk9for pages 18-20, boffo2018cdk9inhibitorsin pages 2-4).  \nDisease associations for CDK9 include its roles in oncogenesis, inflammatory diseases, cardiac hypertrophy, and viral infections; for instance, CDK9 is exploited by HIV through its interaction with the viral Tat protein, which hijacks P-TEFb to promote viral transcription (bacon2019cdk9asignaling pages 1-3, napolitano2002roleofcyclintcdk9 pages 1-2). In cancer, dysregulated CDK9 activity and overexpression have been linked to poor prognosis in several tumor types, driving interest in the development of CDK9 inhibitors as anticancer therapeutics (mandal2021targetingcdk9for pages 18-20, krystof2012perspectiveofcyclindependent pages 1-2).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1.

Phylogeny  \nCyclin-dependent kinase 10 (CDK10) belongs to the large family of serine/threonine protein kinases that regulate cell cycle progression and transcription. It is evolutionarily conserved in metazoans and appears to be closely related to CDK11, sharing 53% sequence identity and 82% sequence similarity within its kinase domain, which positions it within the transcriptional CDKs that expanded during the evolution of higher eukaryotes (duster2022functionalcharacterizationof pages 1-2, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 3-5). Comparative analyses across species indicate that CDK10 and its cyclin partner, Cyclin Q (also known as Cyclin M), are conserved in mammals, underscoring their maintenance as part of the core regulatory circuitry in cellular signaling (duster2022functionalcharacterizationof pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK10 catalyzes a phosphorylation reaction in which ATP and a target protein substrate are converted into ADP, a phosphorylated protein on serine or threonine residues, and a proton. In formulaic terms, this reaction is represented as:  \n  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (duster2022functionalcharacterizationof pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of CDK10 is dependent on the presence of divalent cations, most notably Mg²⁺. Magnesium ions coordinate ATP binding in the catalytic cleft of CDK10 and facilitate the phosphotransfer reaction to its protein substrates (duster2022functionalcharacterizationof pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCDK10 phosphorylates key regulators involved in cell cycle and transcriptional control. Experimentally, substrates identified in vitro include components such as the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II, c-MYC, and the retinoblastoma-associated protein (RB1) (duster2022functionalcharacterizationof pages 1-2). In additional studies, CDK10 has been shown to modify the transcription factor ETS2; phosphorylation of ETS2 by CDK10 promotes its proteasomal degradation, thereby regulating ETS2-dependent transcription (guen2017theawakeningof pages 1-2, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 7-8). Furthermore, CDK10 phosphorylates protein kinase N2 (PKN2), a key regulator of actin dynamics, which in turn affects both actin cytoskeleton organization and ciliogenesis through modulation of RhoA signaling (guen2017theawakeningof pages 2-3, duster2022functionalcharacterizationof pages 4-4). When employing CTD peptides as substrates, phosphorylation efficiency is significantly enhanced by a substitution of serine residue at position 7 with lysine, indicating a substrate preference that disfavors pre-phosphorylation and may require a positively charged residue at this position (duster2022functionalcharacterizationof pages 4-4).\n\n5. Structure  \nThe human CDK10 protein is composed of 360 amino acids and features a canonical kinase domain that is characteristic of the CDK family. Its domain organization is relatively compact, lacking the large N- or C-terminal extensions found in some other CDKs, thus corresponding to a central catalytic core responsible for its serine/threonine kinase activity (duster2022functionalcharacterizationof pages 1-2). Within this kinase domain, key structural elements include an N-terminal lobe, primarily consisting of β-sheets, and a C-terminal lobe that is predominantly α-helical; these two lobes form a cleft that accommodates ATP binding and subsequent phosphotransfer. A critical regulatory feature is the activation loop (T-loop), which contains residue Thr196—this threonine is essential for the activation of CDK10; phosphorylation at Thr196 is required for full catalytic activity, yet it is not necessary for cyclin binding (duster2022functionalcharacterizationof pages 2-3). Mass spectrometry studies have further confirmed additional phosphorylation at Ser276 along with Thr196, suggesting possible layers of regulation within the kinase domain. CDK10 interacts stoichiometrically with its activating partner Cyclin Q (also known as Cyclin M), a cyclin that contains structured cyclin box domains and bipartite nuclear localization signals. Cyclin Q is necessary for facilitating a proper conformation of CDK10 and may assist in substrate recognition by stabilizing the active conformation of the kinase (duster2022functionalcharacterizationof pages 1-2, guen2017theawakeningof pages 1-2).\n\n6. Regulation  \nRegulation of CDK10 activity is multifaceted. A key regulatory mechanism is the phosphorylation of the activation loop at Thr196, a modification essential for catalytic activity without affecting cyclin binding; mutation of Thr196 eliminates kinase activity despite stable association with Cyclin Q (duster2022functionalcharacterizationof pages 2-3, duster2022functionalcharacterizationof pages 5-6). Additionally, CDK10 is phosphorylated at other residues such as Ser276, although the precise functional outcome of this modification remains to be fully elucidated. Beyond direct phosphorylation, CDK10 activity is controlled by its interaction with Cyclin Q, which not only stabilizes the kinase but also protects it from ubiquitin-mediated degradation (guen2017theawakeningof pages 3-4). In cellular contexts, regulatory cross-talk with other CDKs has been suggested by evidence indicating that CDK1 and CDK5 can phosphorylate CDK10 in vitro, implying an integration of CDK10 regulation within broader cell cycle and signaling networks (duster2022functionalcharacterizationof pages 5-6). Finally, the phosphorylation of its substrates—most notably ETS2—serves as an indirect regulatory mechanism, as CDK10-mediated phosphorylation triggers proteasomal degradation of ETS2, thereby modulating transcriptional outcomes (guen2017theawakeningof pages 10-12).\n\n7. Function  \nCDK10 plays critical biological roles through its kinase activity. One of its primary functions is the phosphorylation of ETS2, a transcription factor; this post-translational modification facilitates ETS2 proteasomal degradation, thereby acting as a negative regulator of ETS2-dependent transcription (guen2017theawakeningof pages 1-2, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 7-8). In addition to ETS2, CDK10 phosphorylates substrates involved in cell cycle and transcriptional regulation, including the CTD of RNA polymerase II, c-MYC, and RB1. These phosphorylation events position CDK10 as a hybrid regulator that bridges cell cycle control and transcription. Furthermore, CDK10 phosphorylates PKN2, which plays a key role in actin cytoskeleton organization. This modification impacts RhoA signaling and serves as a negative regulator of ciliogenesis by promoting actin stress fiber formation, a process important for maintaining the normal balance between ciliogenesis and cell cycle re-entry (guen2017theawakeningof pages 2-3, duster2022functionalcharacterizationof pages 1-2). CDK10 has also been implicated in neural development processes and appears to exert tumor-suppressive effects in certain cancers, although its role may vary according to the cellular context (duster2022functionalcharacterizationof pages 1-2, robert2020developmentofa pages 1-2).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral studies have evaluated the chemical inhibition profile of CDK10, highlighting its partial responsiveness to established pan-CDK inhibitors. For instance, compounds such as flavopiridol, dinaciclib, SNS-032, and NVP-2 inhibit CDK10 but with considerably lower potency compared to their activity against CDK9; the measured IC₅₀ values for CDK10 range from submicromolar to low micromolar levels, whereas these compounds exhibit 5- to 20-fold greater potency against CDK9 (duster2022functionalcharacterizationof pages 4-5, duster2022functionalcharacterizationof pages 5-6). In contrast, the CDK11 inhibitor OTS964 shows a unique selectivity advantage, although its potency against CDK10 remains modest. These results underscore the current lack of highly potent and selective inhibitors targeting CDK10 and indicate a need for further structure-guided drug design to overcome these challenges (robert2020developmentofa pages 5-8). In the disease context, perturbations in CDK10 function have been linked with developmental disorders such as STAR syndrome, which is associated with mutations in Cyclin M, and with endocrine therapy resistance in breast cancer, where altered CDK10 activity and expression levels correlate with clinical outcomes (guen2017theawakeningof pages 9-10, duster2022functionalcharacterizationof pages 1-2).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1.

Phylogeny  \nCDK14 belongs to the CDK14–18 subfamily of atypical cyclin‐dependent kinases, which are characterized by unique motifs such as the PFTAIRE sequence that distinguishes them from canonical CDKs involved in classical cell cycle control (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 32-35, ferguson2019discoveryofcovalent pages 1-3). It is evolutionarily conserved across metazoans and is most prominently expressed in brain tissue and specific postmitotic cells, with additional expression detected in testis, heart, kidney, pancreas, and ovary (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 41-44, mikolcevic2012orphankinasesturn pages 1-2). Phylogenetic analyses place CDK14 alongside related PFTAIRE family members, showing conserved catalytic domains and extended regulatory regions; these characteristics imply that CDK14 shares a common ancestor with kinases such as CDK5 and CDK16 and belongs to the broader CMGC kinase group (malumbres2009cyclindependentkinasesa pages 1-2, mikolcevic2012orphankinasesturn pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK14 catalyzes the phosphorylation reaction in which a phosphate group is transferred from ATP to a serine or threonine residue on a protein substrate, resulting in the formation of ADP, a phosphorylated protein, and the release of a proton (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 32-35, ferguson2019discoveryofcovalent pages 1-3).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of CDK14 is dependent on the binding of ATP as the phosphoryl donor, and like other serine/threonine kinases, its activity requires the presence of divalent cations, typically Mg²⁺, which facilitate proper ATP coordination within the active site (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 29-32, ferguson2019discoveryofcovalent pages 20-21).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCDK14 phosphorylates target proteins on serine/threonine residues within specific consensus motifs. Experimentally, one well‐characterized substrate is the WNT co‐receptor LRP6, which is phosphorylated at Ser1490 by the CDK14–cyclin Y complex during the G2/M phase (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 32-35, ferguson2019discoveryofcovalent pages 1-3). In addition, in vitro studies have demonstrated that CDK14 can phosphorylate retinoblastoma protein (RB1); however, the in vivo relevance of RB1 phosphorylation remains to be confirmed (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 35-38). As a member of the CMGC kinase group, CDK14 is expected to exhibit proline-directed substrate specificity, favoring phosphorylatable serine/threonine residues followed by a proline, and additional amino acid preferences resembling the general S/T–P consensus motif (johnson2023anatlasof pages 4-4, janackova2023mechanismusregulacecyklindependentní pages 20-24).\n\n5. Structure  \nCDK14 contains a conserved serine/threonine kinase domain of approximately 300 amino acids that is organized into a bilobal fold with a small N-terminal lobe composed mainly of β-sheets and a larger C-terminal lobe predominantly α-helical. The kinase domain harbors the critical ATP-binding pocket defined by conserved motifs such as the DFG motif responsible for Mg²⁺ coordination and a catalytic loop that includes key residues for phosphate transfer (kamkar2015pftaire1(cyclindependent pages 29-34, korolchuk2018structuralandfunctional pages 35-40). A distinctive feature of CDK14 is the presence of the PFTAIRE motif, which, unlike the classical PSTAIRE sequence found in many cell cycle CDKs, confers unique cyclin-binding specificity. CDK14 associates with cyclin Y, which itself possesses an N-myristoylation signal that facilitates targeting of the complex to cellular membranes (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 32-35, ferguson2019discoveryofcovalent pages 4-5). AlphaFold‐predicted models and structural alignments with other CDKs indicate that CDK14 also contains an activation loop (T-loop), hydrophobic spines, and a C-helix, which are essential for stabilization of the active conformation upon cyclin binding (kamkar2015pftaire1(cyclindependent pages 34-40, mikolcevic2012orphankinasesturn pages 3-4).\n\n6. Regulation  \nCDK14 regulation is mediated primarily through its interaction with cyclin Y, which is required for both activating the kinase and directing its subcellular localization to the plasma membrane. This interaction is facilitated by the unique PFTAIRE motif within CDK14 and the cyclin box domain of cyclin Y (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 32-35, mikolcevic2012orphankinasesturn pages 1-2). Phosphorylation events play a significant role in regulating CDK14 activity; for example, phosphorylation of specific residues on cyclin Y, such as S71 and S73, has been linked to cyclin Y stability via a negative feedback loop (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 32-35, ferguson2019discoveryofcovalent pages 13-14). Additionally, CDK14 itself can be phosphorylated, a modification that is typical for CDKs and is thought to contribute to the conformational adjustments necessary for catalytic activity. CDK14 also phosphorylates downstream targets, including LRP6 at Ser1490, which ties its activity to the regulation of the Wnt signaling cascade during critical cell cycle phases such as G2/M (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 32-35, ferguson2019discoveryofcovalent pages 1-3). Other regulatory interactions, including potential engagement with 14-3-3 proteins, have been observed in studies of related kinases, although detailed mechanisms in CDK14 remain to be fully elucidated (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 114-118, mikolcevic2012orphankinasesturn pages 2-3).\n\n7. Function  \nCDK14 functions as a serine/threonine kinase involved in the regulation of the eukaryotic cell cycle and cellular proliferation. One of its best-characterized roles is in the Wnt signaling pathway, where the CDK14–cyclin Y complex phosphorylates the Wnt co-receptor LRP6 at Ser1490 during the G2/M phase, thereby priming LRP6 for further activation and contributing to cell cycle regulation (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 32-35, ferguson2019discoveryofcovalent pages 1-3). In vitro, CDK14 has been shown to phosphorylate RB1, suggesting a role in cell cycle progression; however, the physiological importance of this reaction remains to be validated in vivo (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 35-38). Furthermore, CDK14 is expressed predominantly in the brain and other postmitotic tissues, indicating functions in neuronal differentiation and possibly in meiosis. In addition to its role in cell cycle control and developmental signaling, CDK14 is implicated as a negative regulator of insulin-responsive glucose transport, thereby potentially influencing metabolic processes (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 114-118). Altered expression of CDK14 has been associated with cancer phenotypes, with studies linking its dysregulation to hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and other tumor types through its effects on cell proliferation, migration, and cytoskeletal dynamics (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 41-44, ferguson2019discoveryofcovalent pages 1-3).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nRecent chemical biology studies have led to the development of covalent inhibitors such as FMF-04-159-2 that target CDK14 and other TAIRE kinases with pan-specificity. These inhibitors irreversibly bind to a non-conserved cysteine (Cys218) in the ATP-binding pocket, thus providing useful chemical probes for dissecting the biological functions of CDK14 and its related kinases (ferguson2019discoveryofcovalent pages 5-8, ferguson2019discoveryofcovalent pages 25-27). Although no inhibitor is currently approved specifically for CDK14, these chemical tools are instrumental in linking alterations in CDK14 activity to cancer biology and other cellular processes. In addition, altered regulatory mechanisms and mutations within the CDK14 signaling pathway have been reported in various oncological studies, though detailed mutation profiles remain to be fully characterized (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 38-41, mikolcevic2012orphankinasesturn pages 3-4).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nCyclin-dependent kinase 15 (CDK15), also known as PFTK2 or ALS2CR7 (UniProt Q96Q40), is a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase family that falls within the broadly conserved CMGC group of serine/threonine kinases. In evolutionary terms, CDK15 is classified among the atypical CDKs that include kinases such as CDK14, CDK16, CDK17, and CDK18, and it shares sequence conservation within its catalytic domain with other CDKs that originated from a common eukaryotic ancestor (Manning et al. 2002). Specifically, phylogenetic analysis has demonstrated that CDK15 is closely related to other PFTAIRE subfamily members and is evolutionarily linked to the CDK5-related sub-branch. Although CDK15 has appeared later in evolution relative to CDK14, its domain architecture—marked by extended N- and C-terminal regions—reflects adaptations that distinguish it from canonical cell cycle regulators, while preserving the core features of serine/threonine kinase activity (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 114-118, chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK15 catalyzes the phosphorylation reaction characteristic of serine/threonine kinases. The overall chemical reaction is: ATP + [protein substrate] → ADP + [protein substrate phosphorylated on a serine or threonine residue] + H⁺. In the case of CDK15, one of the documented substrates is the antiapoptotic protein BIRC5 (survivin), which is phosphorylated at Thr-34, thereby mediating an antiapoptotic effect against TRAIL/TNFSF10-induced apoptosis (chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 21-22).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of CDK15, in common with other cyclin-dependent kinases, is dependent on the presence of divalent cations, primarily Mg²⁺. Magnesium ions are required to coordinate ATP binding within the active site and to facilitate the transfer of the phosphate group during catalysis (knockaert2002pharmacologicalinhibitorsof pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCDK15 exhibits substrate specificity that is typical of serine/threonine-protein kinases within the CDK family. Its activity demonstrates a preference for phosphorylating serine or threonine residues that are followed by a proline residue. In particular, CDK15 is known to phosphorylate the antiapoptotic factor survivin (BIRC5) at threonine 34. This phosphorylation event is consistent with the proline-directed specificity derived from a recognition motif commonly observed in the human serine/threonine kinome, as evidenced by substrate specificity profiles that highlight conserved motifs surrounding phosphorylation sites (johnson2023anatlasof pages 4-4, chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 21-22).\n\n5. Structure  \nThe three-dimensional structure of CDK15 features the conserved bilobal kinase fold typical of cyclin-dependent kinases. It possesses a smaller N-terminal lobe primarily comprised of beta-sheets that contains the glycine-rich loop (G-loop), which is responsible for ATP binding, and a larger C-terminal lobe rich in alpha-helices that forms the catalytic cleft. Within this cleft, key regulatory features such as the activation loop and the DFG motif are present and are crucial for the proper positioning of substrates and the coordination of magnesium ions. CDK15 contains a characteristic PFTAIRE motif located within its cyclin-interaction helix; this motif is a signature of atypical CDKs and distinguishes members of this subfamily from canonical CDKs such as CDK2 (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 32-35, wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 2-3). In addition to the central kinase domain of approximately 300 amino acids that houses the catalytic machinery, CDK15 possesses extended N- and C-terminal regions that are likely to be involved in regulatory interactions and subcellular localization. Although no high-resolution crystal structure exclusively for CDK15 is available in the literature, its domain organization is inferred from homology models and comparative structural analysis with closely related kinases. Key catalytic residues, such as those forming the catalytic loop and hydrophobic spine, are conserved, and the conformation of the activation segment is presumed to be subject to dynamic control by cyclin binding and phosphorylation events (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 32-35, wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 2-3).\n\n6. Regulation  \nRegulation of CDK15 appears to follow the general paradigm established for cyclin-dependent kinases. Its full activation is contingent upon binding to regulatory cyclins, with Cyclin Y being the most prominent candidate based on parallels with related kinases within the PFTAIRE subfamily. Cyclin binding induces conformational changes that facilitate the repositioning of the C-helix and activation loop into an active conformation, making the catalytic site competent for ATP binding and phosphoryl transfer. Moreover, CDK15 is subject to regulatory phosphorylation events; specific phosphorylation of residues within the activation loop is typically required to stabilize its active conformation, although the exact phospho-sites for CDK15 remain to be definitively characterized in the literature. Similar to other atypical CDKs such as CDK16, regulatory phosphorylation may also affect the interaction of CDK15 with 14-3-3 proteins, which in turn modulate its stability and subcellular distribution. Additionally, CDK15 has been implicated in antiapoptotic signaling pathways, whereby its phosphorylation of survivin on Thr-34 constitutes a regulatory mechanism to counteract TRAIL/TNFSF10-induced apoptosis (alonso2021caracterizacióndecdk1418 pages 29-32, chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 21-22).\n\n7. Function  \nCDK15 functions as a serine/threonine-protein kinase with an antiapoptotic role. Its most well-documented function is the phosphorylation of the antiapoptotic protein BIRC5 (survivin) at threonine 34, which decreases the sensitivity of cells to apoptosis induced by TRAIL/TNFSF10. This antiapoptotic activity implicates CDK15 in the regulation of cellular survival pathways and may impact tumor cell resistance mechanisms. Although detailed tissue-specific expression patterns have not been exhaustively characterized, available data suggest that, like other atypical CDKs, CDK15 may exhibit preferential expression in differentiated tissues such as neurons and germ cells. The protein is positioned within a network of signaling cascades where it potentially interacts with cyclins—most notably Cyclin Y—and other regulatory proteins that modulate its catalytic activity. Its role in phosphorylating a key inhibitor of apoptosis reflects a function within cell survival and may contribute to oncogenic processes if dysregulated (chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 21-22, pluta2024cyclin‐dependentkinasesmasters pages 41-42).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nCurrently, specific inhibitors targeting CDK15 have not been well established in the literature, and its regulatory mechanisms as well as substrate spectrum remain less defined compared to more extensively characterized CDKs such as CDK4/6 or CDK5. Nevertheless, CDK15’s involvement in phosphorylation of survivin suggests it could represent a potential therapeutic target in contexts where the antiapoptotic function contributes to disease states such as cancer. There is evidence from related studies that phenotypes associated with dysregulation of atypical CDKs can influence cell survival, and hence, the development of selective small molecule inhibitors may eventually be of therapeutic interest. In terms of disease associations, while CDK15’s antiapoptotic role hints at a potential link to cancer progression and resistance to apoptotic signals, detailed studies on disease-related mutations or precise expression profiles in human tumors have yet to be reported in peer-reviewed sources (peyressatre2015targetingcyclindependentkinases pages 4-6, karimbayli2022dissectingtherole pages 16-19).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny – CDK16, also known as PCTAIRE1 or PCTK1, belongs to the PCTAIRE subfamily of cyclin‐dependent kinases (CDKs) that diverge from the classical cell cycle regulators. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that PCTAIRE proteins are present exclusively in eumetazoans and are highly conserved among higher eukaryotes, with orthologs found in vertebrates such as mammals as well as in non‐mammalian species that possess a nervous system (amrhein2022discoveryof3amino1hpyrazolebased pages 1-3, mikolcevic2012orphankinasesturn pages 1-2). CDK16 is grouped together with other related kinases, including CDK17 and CDK18, which together form a distinct subfamily divergent from the canonical CDKs (cole2009pctkproteinsthe pages 1-2, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 1-2). The evolutionary relationship of CDK16 with other kinases is underscored by its moderate sequence identity with mitotic kinases such as CDK2 (approximately 52–57% identity) and CDK5 and by the presence of extended regulatory regions that are absent in classical CDKs (endicott2013structuralcharacterizationof pages 3-5, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 2-4).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed – As a serine/threonine protein kinase, CDK16 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphoryl group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of specific serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins. The reaction can be represented as:  \n  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺  \nThis reaction is central to CDK16’s function in modulating the activity, localization, and interaction of its target proteins (endicott2013structuralcharacterizationof pages 2-3).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements – The catalytic activity of CDK16, similar to other protein kinases, requires divalent metal ion cofactors. In particular, Mg²⁺ ions are essential for effective ATP binding and the phosphoryl transfer reaction (amrhein2022discoveryof3amino1hpyrazolebased pages 1-3, endicott2013structuralcharacterizationof pages 3-5).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity – CDK16 exhibits a substrate specificity typical of serine/threonine kinases with a preference for proline-directed phosphorylation motifs. Experimental data indicate that CDK16 phosphorylates substrates involved in vesicle trafficking and exocytosis. Among its substrates, CDK16 phosphorylates the N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF) to regulate its oligomerization status, a modification which plays a key role in modulating vesicle-mediated transport processes (cole2009pctkproteinsthe pages 7-8). In addition, in vitro studies have demonstrated that CDK16 can phosphorylate cyclin Y at Ser-336 and also has been associated with phosphorylation events on regulatory proteins such as p27, where phosphorylation may affect stability and subcellular localization; however, in the context of its primary functions the phosphorylation of NSF is most prominently established (amrhein2022discoveryof3amino1hpyrazolebased pages 1-3, yanagi2014pctaire1phosphorylatesp27 pages 10-12).\n\n5. Structure – The structure of CDK16 is organized around a conserved protein kinase domain that shares features with other members of the CDK family. This central kinase domain, which encompasses key catalytic motifs including the HRD and DFG sequences, is responsible for ATP binding and phosphoryl transfer (endicott2013structuralcharacterizationof pages 3-5, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 2-4). Unique to CDK16 is an extended N-terminal region that is critical for binding to its activating partner, cyclin Y, and a relatively short C-terminal tail that may modulate protein-protein interactions. The N-terminal extension contains a region necessary for cyclin association that distinguishes CDK16 from canonical CDKs with minimal regulatory extensions (amrhein2022discoveryof3amino1hpyrazolebased pages 1-3, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 7-9). Structural studies, including those based on crystal structures of the kinase domain (such as the solved structure corresponding to residues 205–473; not detailed here but referenced in multiple publications), reveal that in the absence of cyclin binding, CDK16 may assume an inactive conformation. Additionally, the presence of a PCTAIRE motif in place of the conventional PSTAIRE helix, and alterations in regions such as the activation segment, contribute to a distinct conformational state, which is only fully ordered upon cyclin Y binding (endicott2013structuralcharacterizationof pages 3-5, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 2-4). These unique features in the kinase domain, including a possible partially inverted DFG motif and differences in the C-helix configuration, underline the atypical structure of CDK16 compared to more widely studied CDKs (mikolcevic2012orphankinasesturn pages 4-6, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 4-6).\n\n6. Regulation – The regulation of CDK16 is multifaceted and is primarily governed by protein-protein interactions and site-specific phosphorylation events. Binding to cyclin Y (CCNY) is required for full kinase activity; this interaction is mediated by the extended N-terminal region of CDK16 (amrhein2022discoveryof3amino1hpyrazolebased pages 1-3, mikolcevic2012orphankinasesturn pages 2-3). Phosphorylation at specific serine residues, such as Ser153, plays a significant role in modulating CDK16 activity by inhibiting cyclin Y binding when phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA) (amrhein2022discoveryof3amino1hpyrazolebased pages 3-4, kamkar2015pftaire1(cyclindependent pages 49-53). Conversely, phosphorylation at other sites such as Ser95 by kinases like CDK5 may enhance the activity of CDK16, further demonstrating the complexity of its regulation (mikolcevic2012orphankinasesturn pages 8-9). In addition, association with regulatory proteins including members of the 14-3-3 family and p11 have been observed, suggesting that these interactions may sequester CDK16 or modulate substrate access, thereby fine-tuning its enzymatic output (cole2009pctkproteinsthe pages 8-10, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 7-9). The regulation by cyclin binding and phosphorylation ensures that CDK16 activity is tightly controlled in a tissue-specific manner, particularly in post-mitotic cells such as neurons and spermatids (amrhein2022discoveryof3amino1hpyrazolebased pages 1-3, mikolcevic2012orphankinasesturn pages 1-2).\n\n7. Function – CDK16 plays versatile roles in cellular physiology primarily through its kinase activity on substrates involved in vesicle trafficking and exocytosis. It phosphorylates NSF, thereby regulating NSF oligomerization and contributing to efficient vesicle-mediated transport; this process is critical for the regulated release of growth hormone from brain neurons (amrhein2022discoveryof3amino1hpyrazolebased pages 1-3, cole2009pctkproteinsthe pages 7-8). Additionally, CDK16 activity is required for normal spermatogenesis, as evidenced by its high expression in testicular tissues and its role in spermatid maturation (mikolcevic2012orphankinasesturn pages 8-9, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 17-18). In the context of neuronal development, CDK16 is implicated in the regulation of neuron differentiation and dendrite development, which is supported by its expression in post-mitotic neurons and localization to regions involved in synaptic and dendritic functions (amrhein2022discoveryof3amino1hpyrazolebased pages 1-3, mikolcevic2012orphankinasesturn pages 2-3). Moreover, CDK16 has been reported to contribute to the regulation of insulin secretion by modulating the secretory pathway in response to changes in blood glucose levels (amrhein2022discoveryof3amino1hpyrazolebased pages 1-3, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 15-17). In vitro studies have also demonstrated that CDK16 can phosphorylate cyclin Y at Ser-336, which may have regulatory implications in CDK16–cyclin Y complex formation (amrhein2022discoveryof3amino1hpyrazolebased pages 3-4). The combined expression in the brain and testes aligns well with its multifunctional role in both neural signaling and reproductive biology (mikolcevic2012orphankinasesturn pages 8-9, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 17-17).\n\n8. Other Comments – Recent chemical biology efforts have led to the development of selective inhibitors based on 3-amino-1H-pyrazole scaffolds that target the conserved ATP-binding pocket of CDK16, with lead compounds reporting nanomolar cellular potency; these compounds provide useful tools for dissecting CDK16 functions and may have therapeutic applications (amrhein2022discoveryof3amino1hpyrazolebased pages 1-3). Additional inhibitors such as Dabrafenib and Rebastinib have been reported to potently inhibit CDK16 activity in repurposing studies, underscoring the potential for pharmacological modulation of this kinase (karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 6-7). Dysregulation of CDK16 has been associated with cancer progression in several tumor types including those of the breast, prostate, and lung, and alterations in its expression are observed in various transformed cellular contexts; however, the protein is also considered critical for normal neuronal and spermatogenic functions (amrhein2022discoveryof3amino1hpyrazolebased pages 3-4, yanagi2014pctaire1phosphorylatesp27 pages 10-12). Ongoing research is focused on a deeper understanding of its substrate recognition mechanisms and on developing highly selective inhibitors to fully exploit CDK16 as a therapeutic target in diseases where its activity is aberrant (karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 6-7, pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 17-18).\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nCyclin-dependent kinase 17 (CDK17), also known as PCTAIRE2 or PCTK2, belongs to the PCTAIRE subfamily within the CDK family and is classified as an atypical serine/threonine kinase. CDK17 is evolutionarily conserved in higher eukaryotes and is absent in yeast genomes, consistent with an evolutionary specialization in multicellular organisms. It shares high sequence homology in its catalytic domain with other PCTAIRE kinases (CDK16 and CDK18) and displays unique N-terminal extensions that distinguish it from canonical cell cycle CDKs. These features place CDK17 within the CMGC group of kinases, whose evolutionary relationships have been documented from yeast to man (karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 1-2, mikolcevic2012orphankinasesturn pages 1-2).  \n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK17 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to a serine or threonine residue on its substrate. The chemical reaction can be represented as follows:  \nATP + [substrate protein] → ADP + [substrate protein]-phospho-serine/threonine + H⁺ (karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 1-2).  \n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe enzymatic activity of CDK17 depends on the presence of divalent metal ions, with Mg²⁺ being required as a cofactor to facilitate ATP binding and proper catalysis (karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 1-2).  \n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nCDK17 is known by similarity to exhibit serine/threonine-phosphorylating activity, with histone H1 cited as a substrate. The preferred substrate motif is not comprehensively defined; however, evidence from related PCTAIRE kinases indicates that a proline residue following the phosphorylation site and basic residues at certain positions may contribute to substrate recognition (shehata2012analysisofsubstrate pages 1-2, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 2-4).  \n\n5. Structure  \nCDK17 contains a central catalytic kinase domain that is flanked by unique N-terminal and C-terminal extensions. The catalytic domain displays the typical bilobal structure found in CDKs, comprising an N-terminal lobe responsible for ATP binding and a C-terminal lobe that accommodates the substrate. A distinguishing structural feature of CDK17 is the presence of a PCTAIRE box within its αC helix region, which replaces the canonical PSTAIRE sequence found in other cell cycle CDKs; this domain is critical for the regulation of kinase activity via cyclin binding (endicott2013structuralcharacterizationof pages 2-3, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 13-14). Although a high-resolution crystal structure of CDK17 has not been reported, homology models based on related PCTAIRE kinases such as CDK16 indicate conservation of key structural elements, including the activation loop, DFG motif, and hydrophobic spine, which are essential for catalysis and regulation (mikolcevic2012orphankinasesturn pages 2-3, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 4-6).  \n\n6. Regulation  \nRegulation of CDK17 activity involves mechanisms that are similar to those described for other members of the PCTAIRE subfamily. These regulatory mechanisms include activation through binding to cyclin partners, most notably cyclin Y and potentially other cyclin variants, as well as phosphorylation events at key residues within the activation loop. Phosphorylation by CDK-activating kinases (CAKs) is presumed necessary to induce conformational changes from an inactive to active state, although the precise cyclin partners and phosphorylation sites for CDK17 remain to be fully characterized (karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 15-17, endicott2013structuralcharacterizationof pages 3-5). Additionally, CDK17 activity may be modulated by intracellular localization signals and binding of regulatory proteins, as observed in related PCTAIRE kinases (karimbayli2022dissectingtherole pages 68-71).  \n\n7. Function  \nCDK17 is predominantly expressed in terminally differentiated neurons and in a limited set of other tissues such as the kidney, testis, and intestine, indicating a specialized role outside the conventional cell cycle regulation seen in other CDKs. It is implicated in neuronal functions, including processes related to neurite outgrowth and intracellular trafficking, and is reported to phosphorylate histone H1 in a manner similar to other serine/threonine kinases. This tissue-specific expression pattern suggests that CDK17 may play a role in the regulation of neuronal differentiation and possibly in the modulation of chromatin structure through histone phosphorylation (karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 1-2, karimbayli2022dissectingtherole pages 68-71, cole2009pctkproteinsthe pages 2-4).  \n\n8. Other Comments  \nSpecific inhibitors targeting CDK17 are not well established, and most available inhibitors tend to target multiple CDKs, including members of the PCTAIRE subfamily. CDK17 has been associated with disease contexts including neurodegenerative disorders and various cancers, with alterations in its expression observed in tumor types such as glioblastoma and ovarian cancer. However, detailed functional studies are still required to fully establish its role in these diseases and to develop selective therapeutic agents. Notable studies have identified potential regulatory interactions with proteins such as TRAP and components involved in vesicular trafficking, which may further influence its cellular functions (karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 10-13, karimbayli2022dissectingtherole pages 57-62, cole2009pctkproteinsthe pages 8-10).  \n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nCDK18, also known as PCTAIRE3 or PCTK3, belongs to the PCTAIRE subfamily of cyclin‐dependent kinases that diverged from the classical cell cycle regulators such as CDK1 and CDK2. The PCTAIRE kinases are evolutionarily conserved among higher eukaryotes and can be traced back to organisms with a centralized nervous system. Orthologs of CDK18 have been identified throughout mammalian species, with particular enrichment in tissues such as brain and testis, supporting its conserved role in post‐mitotic cells. Phylogenetically, CDK18 groups with other atypical CDKs that share unique sequence motifs—most notably, the substitution of a serine for the canonical proline in the PSTAIRE motif, resulting instead in a PCTAIRE sequence. This feature distinguishes the PCTAIRE kinases from canonical family members and suggests that they have evolved specialized functions possibly linked to signaling in differentiated cells (cole2009pctkproteinsthe pages 1-2, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 2-4).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK18 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of a serine or threonine residue on a substrate protein. In biochemical terms, the reaction is as follows:  \n  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺  \nThis reaction, common to serine/threonine kinases, underlies its regulatory role in phosphorylating substrates involved in cell cycle checkpoints and signal transduction cascades (barone2016humancdk18promotes pages 1-1).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of CDK18, like most serine/threonine protein kinases, is dependent upon divalent metal ions. In particular, Mg²⁺ is required as a cofactor to facilitate the proper coordination of ATP within the active site and to enable the ensuing phosphoryl transfer reaction. This cofactor requirement is a shared characteristic among kinases of the CMGC group and contributes to the structural stabilization of the ATP–protein kinase complex (shah2020cdksfamilya pages 8-9).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nThe substrate specificity of CDK18 is characterized by a preference for phosphorylating serine/threonine residues, and it is thought to exhibit a proline-directed substrate preference akin to other CDKs. Although the detailed consensus substrate motif for CDK18 has not been comprehensively delineated, published studies indicate that its kinase activity involves phosphorylation events on substrates that contain proline-directed serine/threonine motifs. Experimentally, CDK18 has been implicated in the phosphorylation of several key regulatory proteins; for example, it plays a role in the replication stress response by modulating the phosphorylation status of proteins such as RAD9, and it influences tau protein phosphorylation at residues Thr231 and Ser235 in neuronal cells. Such phosphorylation events are consistent with the reported roles of CDK18 in genome integrity and in neuronal signal transduction pathways (cole2009pctkproteinsthe pages 8-10, pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 7-9).\n\n5. Structure  \nCDK18 is approximately 500 amino acids in length and has a domain organization typical of the CDK family, but with distinct features that set it apart from canonical cell cycle kinases. Its central kinase domain comprises the bi‐lobed structure seen in other CDKs: an N-terminal lobe primarily responsible for ATP binding and a larger C-terminal lobe that contains substrate-binding elements. The kinase domain includes conserved motifs such as the HRD sequence in subdomain VI and the DFG sequence in subdomain VII, both of which are essential for catalytic activity and Mg²⁺ coordination.  \nIn addition to the catalytic domain, CDK18 contains extended N-terminal and short C-terminal regions that are unique and may contribute to its regulation and substrate interactions. The N-terminal extension includes the so-called “PCTAIRE box,” which is distinctive for this subfamily and is thought to mediate interactions with regulatory cyclin partners, such as cyclin A2 and possibly cyclin Y. Although no high-resolution crystal structure has been reported specifically for CDK18, homology models based on the resolved structure of the related CDK16 suggest that CDK18 adopts a typical CDK fold with a well-conserved catalytic core. Key regulatory features likely include an activation loop subject to phosphorylation and a C-helix that plays a role in positioning key residues required for catalysis. Additionally, the presence of a putative Protein Kinase A (PKA) substrate motif (R-R-X-S) in its N-terminal extension indicates that phosphorylation mediated by PKA may modulate the conformation and activation state of CDK18 (pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 1-2, cole2009pctkproteinsthe pages 1-2, endicott2013structuralcharacterizationof pages 3-5, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 2-4).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of CDK18 occurs through multiple mechanisms that are characteristic of both classical and atypical cyclin-dependent kinases. One key regulatory mechanism involves binding to cyclins—most notably cyclin A2—and this interaction is critical for the activation of its kinase activity. In addition to cyclin binding, CDK18 is regulated by phosphorylation events; Protein Kinase A (PKA) has been shown to phosphorylate CDK18 at specific serine residues (for instance, a reported modification at Ser12) that enhance its activity, even in the absence of cyclin A2. Phosphorylation within the activation loop of the kinase domain is believed to be an important regulatory cue, although the precise sites and enzymes involved remain an area of active investigation.  \nFurthermore, CDK18 is subject to regulation via interactions with other regulatory proteins; for example, binding to members of the 14-3-3 family and ubiquitination machinery (such as the E3 ubiquitin ligase STUB1) may impact its subcellular localization and stability. These regulatory mechanisms enable tight temporal and spatial control of CDK18 activity, ensuring its involvement in replication stress signaling and neuronal function occurs in a regulated manner (barone2016humancdk18promotes pages 12-13, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 13-14, cole2009pctkproteinsthe pages 7-8, pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 1-2).\n\n7. Function  \nCDK18 may play a critical role in signal transduction cascades in terminally differentiated cells. Its biological functions extend beyond the canonical roles of cell cycle progression to include maintenance of genome stability and modulation of neuronal signaling.  \nOne of the best-characterized functions of CDK18 is its involvement in the replication stress response. Experimental evidence indicates that CDK18 facilitates the ATR-mediated signaling cascade during replication stress by promoting the chromatin retention of key checkpoint proteins such as RAD9 and RAD17. By ensuring robust ATR activation, CDK18 contributes to the stabilization of stalled replication forks and helps maintain genome integrity (barone2016humancdk18promotes pages 1-1, pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 7-9).  \nIn neuronal systems, CDK18 is expressed predominantly in post-mitotic cells including neurons and oligodendrocytes. In these contexts, CDK18 has been associated with the phosphorylation of tau protein at residues Thr231 and Ser235, modifications that have been observed in Alzheimer’s disease models. Through its action on tau and potential interactions with other regulatory proteins in neuronal signaling pathways, CDK18 may influence processes related to neurite outgrowth and synaptic function (cole2009pctkproteinsthe pages 8-10, pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 13-14).  \nMoreover, CDK18 appears to influence cell adhesion and migration. Data suggest that it modulates the phosphorylation state of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), thereby impacting cytoskeletal reorganization and cellular motility. Such functions are particularly relevant in the context of tumor biology where alterations in cell adhesion and migration can contribute to cancer progression. Expression analyses reveal that CDK18 is differentially expressed in several human tissues, with notable expression in brain, heart, testis, and spinal cord, and differential regulation in pathological conditions such as cancer, metabolic disorders, and neurodegeneration (pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 6-7, karimbayli2024insightsintothe pages 9-10).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nCDK18 has emerged as a protein of interest given its multifaceted roles in both genome maintenance and signal transduction in terminally differentiated cells. Recent gene copy number analyses in human cancers have revealed that CDK18 exhibits copy number gains in a significant fraction of breast cancers, and its deregulation has been associated with resistance to replication stress–inducing chemotherapeutic agents in glioblastoma. Furthermore, expression studies indicate that CDK18 may be linked to metabolic regulation in pancreatic islets as well as to psychiatric and neurodegenerative conditions, including depression, Alzheimer’s disease, and demyelinating disorders.  \nOn the therapeutic front, the unique regulation and substrate specificity of CDK18 distinguish it from classical CDKs and render it a potential target for the development of selective inhibitors. Although no highly specific pharmacological inhibitors targeting CDK18 have yet entered clinical practice, ongoing inhibitor development efforts are exploring compounds that exploit its unique structural features and regulatory mechanisms. The convergence of its roles in ATR signaling, tau phosphorylation, and modulation of cell adhesion highlights the potential of CDK18 as a biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology and in neurological diseases (pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 11-13, pepino2021overviewofpctk3cdk18 pages 14-16, chaput2016potentialroleof pages 16-17, chowdhury2023cmgckinasesin pages 21-22).\n\n9.

Together with TBC1D32, controls the structure of the primary cilium by coordinating assembly of the ciliary membrane and axoneme, allowing GLI2 to be properly activated in response to SHH signaling (By similarity). Involved in cell growth. Activates CDK2, a kinase involved in the control of the cell cycle, by phosphorylating residue 'Thr-160'**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting. The output should mirror the organization and style of the template, without introducing new sections such as \"Summary\" or \"Conclusion\".\nAlso, do not interpret results. For example **DO NOT** add sentences to interpret the findings (such as **suggesting that**, etc.)\nAlso, exclude **Unknown journals** and only include peer-reviewed journals as sources. Prioritize articles with a higher number of citations.\n\n---\n\n# Method\nTo perform the task, do the following subtasks step-by-step:\n1. Collect all relevant published papers about the the protein introduced in the Information section.\n2. Read the papers and use them properly based on the **Section Guidelines** described below.\n3. Make the final format and header names aligned with the Reference Template.\n\n---\n\n# Reference Template\n\nThis template provides an example of expected **section headers, structure and writing tone**. Use it solely to guide the format. You are encouraged to improve the depth and comprehensiveness of your response without being repetitive and speculative.\n\n\"\"\"\n**Accepted name:** Ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K), which usually refers to either S6K1 or S6k2. Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nCyclin-dependent kinase 20 (CDK20), also known as cell cycle-related kinase (CCRK) or CDCH, is a member of the serine/threonine protein kinase family that belongs to the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) in the human kinome. Sequence analyses indicate that CDK20 is evolutionarily conserved, with orthologs reported in species as divergent as Old World monkeys, rodents, fish, amphibians, and even yeast, underscoring its fundamental biological role (cheung2011ccrk(cellcycle pages 1-2, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 1-2). CDK20 shares approximately 43% sequence identity with CDK7, the canonical CDK-activating kinase (CAK) in mammals, which places it within an extended group of CDKs that are implicated not only in cell cycle control but also in transcriptional regulation (lai2020theroleof pages 1-3, malumbres2009cyclindependentkinasesa pages 2-4). From an evolutionary standpoint, the expansion of the CDK family is thought to have occurred early in eukaryotic evolution; therefore, CDK20 is considered part of the evolutionarily conserved core of kinases that manage signaling and cell cycle transitions from yeast to man (guo2004comparativegenomicsof pages 9-10).  \n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nCDK20 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to specific serine/threonine residues on substrate proteins. The reaction follows the general scheme:  \n  ATP + substrate (–OH) → ADP + substrate phosphorylated (–OPO3^2–) + H^+  \nA principal substrate of CDK20 is CDK2, which is phosphorylated on threonine-160 in its activation (T-) loop; this post-translational modification is critical for CDK2 activation and proper transition from the G1 to S phase of the cell cycle (tian2012cellcyclerelatedkinase pages 1-2, cheung2011ccrk(cellcycle pages 1-2).  \n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of CDK20 is dependent on the binding of ATP and the presence of a divalent metal ion cofactor, most commonly magnesium (Mg^2+). Mg^2+ facilitates the correct positioning of ATP within the kinase active site and stabilizes the transition state during phosphoryl transfer (tian2012cellcyclerelatedkinase pages 1-2, malumbres2014cyclindependentkinases pages 1-2).  \n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nThe substrate specificity of CDK20 is primarily defined by its ability to phosphorylate CDK2 on the threonine-160 residue, which lies within the activation loop of CDK2. This modification is essential for CDK2’s full catalytic activity and, by extension, for the progression of the cell cycle from G1 to S phase (cheung2011ccrk(cellcycle pages 1-2, tian2012cellcyclerelatedkinase pages 1-2). In addition, experimental studies have indicated that CDK20 may target further substrates that are involved in cell cycle regulation and possibly in ciliary function—for example, substrates such as MAK-related kinase (MRK/ICK) have been reported in some studies (fu2006identificationofyinyang pages 3-5). Although a comprehensive consensus motif for CDK20’s substrates is not fully established, its known activity on CDK2 suggests a preference for recognition of activation loop residues in the context of CDK complexes (lai2020theroleof pages 1-3, tian2012cellcyclerelatedkinase pages 1-2).  \n\n5. Structure  \nCDK20 is a relatively small kinase, with a molecular weight of approximately 42 kDa and composed of 346 amino acids. It contains a central kinase domain that spans roughly residues 4 to 288 and is organized into two lobes: a smaller N-terminal lobe that harbors a glycine-rich loop responsible for ATP binding, and a larger C-terminal lobe that includes the catalytic cleft and activation segment. Within the activation loop—a critical regulatory element—lies the threonine-160 residue, phosphorylation of which is necessary for CDK2 activation in the pathway controlled by CDK20 (cheung2011ccrk(cellcycle pages 1-2, tian2012cellcyclerelatedkinase pages 1-2). In terms of structural features, CDK20 displays the conserved 11 subdomains that typify serine/threonine protein kinases, with the catalytic lysine and characteristic C-helix that participate in ATP coordination and substrate binding (lai2020theroleof pages 5-7, wohlbold2006thecyclindependentkinase pages 4-5). Notably, alternative splicing gives rise to at least four transcript variants, including a cardiac-specific isoform that exhibits differences in its activation capability toward CDK2, highlighting a degree of structural and functional diversification (lai2020theroleof pages 5-7, wohlbold2006thecyclindependentkinase pages 2-3). Although no direct high-resolution crystal structure for CDK20 is available in the peer-reviewed literature, its domain organization and overall fold are inferred from homology models and comparisons with other CDKs such as CDK7 and CDK2, which have well-established three-dimensional structures (wood2018structuralinsightsinto pages 3-4, endicott2013structuralcharacterizationof pages 2-3).  \n\n6. Regulation  \nRegulatory mechanisms governing CDK20 activity encompass several layers. Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, play a key role; in the context of its functional relationship with CDK2, the phosphorylation status of its target threonine residue is crucial for activating downstream cell cycle events (tian2012cellcyclerelatedkinase pages 1-2, cheung2011ccrk(cellcycle pages 1-2). In addition, CDK20 expression and activity are influenced by alternative splicing, which produces distinct isoforms with differential abilities to activate CDK2 and participate in other regulatory pathways (lai2020theroleof pages 5-7, wohlbold2006thecyclindependentkinase pages 2-3). Epigenetic regulation has also been observed; hypermethylation at specific promoter CpG sites correlates with high CDK20 expression in certain tissues such as the adult brain cortex (cheung2011ccrk(cellcycle pages 1-2). Protein–protein interactions further regulate its activity, as CDK20 forms complexes with cyclin partners and other regulatory proteins that may influence its substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency. Despite initial hypotheses that CDK20 might exhibit intrinsic CDK-activating kinase (CAK) activity akin to CDK7, several reports establish that CDK20 lacks robust intrinsic CAK activity and may require interaction with additional co-regulators to achieve full catalytic function (wohlbold2006thecyclindependentkinase pages 1-2, tian2012cellcyclerelatedkinase pages 4-5).  \n\n7. Function  \nCDK20 fulfills critical cellular roles in both cell cycle regulation and developmental signaling pathways. Its primary enzymatic function is to phosphorylate CDK2 on threonine-160, an indispensable step in activating CDK2 and driving the G1-to-S phase transition in dividing cells (tian2012cellcyclerelatedkinase pages 1-2, cheung2011ccrk(cellcycle pages 1-2). In addition to its role in cell proliferation, CDK20 is essential for high-level responses to Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling in the developing neural tube. In collaboration with the protein TBC1D32, CDK20 coordinates the assembly of the primary cilium by orchestrating the formation of both the ciliary membrane and the axoneme. This structural coordination is necessary for the proper activation of the GLI2 transcription factor in response to Shh, thereby playing a pivotal role in neural development (lai2020theroleof pages 3-5, tian2012cellcyclerelatedkinase pages 1-2). Tissue expression studies have shown that CDK20 is highly expressed in tissues such as the brain, kidney, liver, heart, and placenta, reflecting its multifaceted roles in development and cell growth (cheung2011ccrk(cellcycle pages 1-2, lai2020theroleof pages 1-3). Furthermore, overexpression of CDK20 has been identified in various cancers—including glioblastoma, ovarian carcinoma, and colorectal cancer—where dysregulation of cell cycle progression and apoptosis contributes to tumor progression (cheung2011ccrk(cellcycle pages 2-3, tian2012cellcyclerelatedkinase pages 4-5).  \n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral experimental studies have identified small-molecule inhibitors that target CDK20 or its associated signaling pathways, providing a rationale for therapeutic intervention in cancers where CDK20 is overexpressed. For instance, the inhibitor RGB-286147 has been shown to reduce cell proliferation by interfering with CDK20-mediated signaling (cheung2011ccrk(cellcycle pages 2-3, tian2012cellcyclerelatedkinase pages 4-5). CDK20 is also characterized by the presence of multiple splice variants; among these, a cardiac-specific isoform has been reported that does not efficiently activate CDK2, indicating functional divergence among the isoforms (lai2020theroleof pages 5-7, wohlbold2006thecyclindependentkinase pages 2-3). Although no specific disease-associated mutations have been consistently documented in the peer-reviewed literature, the correlation between CDK20 overexpression and aggressive tumor phenotypes underscores its clinical importance (cheung2011ccrk(cellcycle pages 2-3, guo2004comparativegenomicsof pages 9-10). Ongoing research endeavors are focused on delineating the complete substrate repertoire of CDK20, elucidating its precise regulatory mechanisms, and developing potent and selective inhibitors for potential therapeutic applications.  \n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nFructosamine‐3‐kinase (FN3K) is highly conserved among vertebrates, being identified in mammals, birds, amphibians, and fishes, whereas close homologs are absent from yeasts and insects. Its evolutionary history suggests that FN3K likely emerged after a gene‐duplication event in which an ancestral FN3K‐related protein (FN3K-RP) gave rise to a divergent enzyme specialized for phosphorylating fructosamines (avemaria2015possibleroleof pages 1-2, conner2005somecluesas pages 1-3). FN3K shares distant relationships with small-molecule kinases such as the aminoglycoside phosphotransferases, as evidenced by sequence features and domain organization that place it within a distinct subgroup of the broader protein kinase-like (PKL) superfamily (beisswenger2001humanfructosamine3kinasepurification pages 1-2, delpierre2003fructosamine3kinasean pages 1-2). Phylogenetic studies based on sequence conservation further illustrate that while FN3K and FN3K-RP have approximately 65% sequence identity, they have evolved to acquire different substrate specificities and regulatory controls (avemaria2015possibleroleof pages 1-2, conner2005somecluesas pages 8-13).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nFN3K catalyzes an ATP-dependent phosphorylation reaction that targets fructosamine adducts on glycated proteins. In this reaction, the enzyme transfers the γ-phosphate from ATP to the 3-hydroxyl group of the fructosamine residue (typically formed on lysine side chains) to yield ADP and a fructosamine-3-phosphate intermediate. This phosphorylated sugar adduct is inherently unstable under physiological conditions and spontaneously degrades into free lysine, inorganic phosphate, and 3-deoxyglucosone (3-DG) (beisswenger2001humanfructosamine3kinasepurification pages 2-4, delpierre2003fructosamine3kinasean pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of FN3K is dependent on ATP as a phosphate donor and requires divalent metal ions, most notably Mg²⁺, to coordinate and stabilize the nucleotide during phosphoryl transfer. This cofactor requirement is characteristic of kinases which utilize ATP during the phosphorylation of their substrates (beisswenger2001humanfructosamine3kinasepurification pages 1-2, tsai2006anewinhibitor pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nFN3K exhibits a high degree of substrate specificity for protein-bound fructosamines. The enzyme preferentially phosphorylates fructoselysine residues in glycated proteins, showing markedly higher affinity for these adducts compared to free sugars. In addition, FN3K is also capable of phosphorylating other related sugar-amine adducts such as psicosamines and ribulosamines, although the primary substrate under physiological conditions is the fructoselysine residue on long-lived proteins like hemoglobin (avemaria2015possibleroleof pages 1-2, beeraka2021thetamingof pages 14-15, delpierre2003fructosamine3kinasean pages 1-2). This substrate selectivity ensures that FN3K effectively participates in the repair of proteins that have been modified by non-enzymatic glycation processes.\n\n5. Structure  \nFN3K is a monomeric protein consisting of 309 amino acids, with an approximate molecular weight of 35 kDa. Its structure is characterized by a central kinase domain that adopts the classical protein kinase-like fold, featuring a bilobal organization with an N-terminal lobe predominantly composed of β-sheets and a C-terminal lobe made mainly of α-helices (beisswenger2001humanfructosamine3kinasepurification pages 6-7, delpierrre2004identificationoffructosamine pages 1-1). Conserved catalytic residues such as Lys41, which is critical for ATP binding, along with Glu55 and Asp244—required for proper positioning of substrates and the divalent cation—are present in its active site (beisswenger2001humanfructosamine3kinasepurification pages 4-6, garg2025themolecularbasis pages 2-3). Moreover, FN3K harbors a conserved P-loop motif with repeated glycine residues that contributes not only to nucleotide binding but also appears to be strategically positioned relative to the substrate-binding pocket. Although no extended regulatory regions comparable to those found in classical eukaryotic protein kinases have been described, its overall topology is consistent with that of kinases adapted for small molecule substrates (beisswenger2001humanfructosamine3kinasepurification pages 1-2, fortpied2005plantribulosamineerythrulosamine3kinase pages 6-7). Structural modeling and limited crystallographic data confirm that the core kinase fold is maintained, and unique features such as a compact substrate-binding region tailor FN3K for its specialized deglycation function (garg2025themolecularbasis pages 8-10).\n\n6. Regulation  \nRegulation of FN3K occurs primarily at the level of enzymatic activity rather than through extensive post-translational modifications typically seen in multisite-regulated kinases. Variability in FN3K activity has been observed among tissues and is correlated with intracellular glucose concentrations, as tissues with long-lived proteins (e.g., erythrocytes, lens, brain) exhibit higher activity to counteract glycation (avemaria2015possibleroleof pages 1-2, dacunha2006increasedproteinglycation pages 6-7). Additionally, genetic polymorphisms in the FN3K gene have been shown to influence enzyme activity and, consequently, site-specific protein glycation, as seen by differences in glycation levels of hemoglobin in normoglycemic subjects (delpierre2006variabilityinerythrocyte pages 1-2, conner2005somecluesas pages 8-13). Although detailed post-translational regulation mechanisms (such as phosphorylation or ubiquitination of FN3K itself) are not extensively characterized in the current literature, the enzyme’s activity appears to be modulated by substrate accessibility and possibly by changes in cellular redox conditions as indirectly implicated by studies examining protein repair functions (beisswenger2001humanfructosamine3kinasepurification pages 2-4, tsai2006anewinhibitor pages 1-2).\n\n7. Function  \nFN3K functions as a protein repair enzyme by reversing non-enzymatic glycation modifications that occur during the Maillard reaction. By phosphorylating fructoselysine residues on glycated proteins, FN3K generates fructoselysine-3-phosphate, an unstable intermediate that spontaneously degrades to regenerate the unmodified lysine residue along with the production of 3-deoxyglucosone (3-DG) and inorganic phosphate (beisswenger2001humanfructosamine3kinasepurification pages 2-4, delpierre2003fructosamine3kinasean pages 1-2). This deglycation process is especially important in erythrocytes, where proteins cannot be newly synthesized during the 120-day lifespan of the cell, thereby necessitating a repair mechanism to maintain protein function (avemaria2015possibleroleof pages 1-2, dacunha2006increasedproteinglycation pages 6-7). In addition to its role in protein repair, FN3K has been implicated in the cellular response to oxidative stress. By reversing glycation on key regulatory proteins such as NRF2, FN3K helps to maintain antioxidant responses, which are critical for redox homeostasis in cells (beeraka2021thetamingof pages 12-14, beisswenger2001humanfructosamine3kinasepurification pages 2-4). The enzyme is expressed ubiquitously, with appreciable levels in tissues that are particularly susceptible to glycation damage due to high intracellular glucose concentration, indicating a protective role especially in diabetic conditions (dacunha2006increasedproteinglycation pages 7-8, conner2005somecluesas pages 1-3).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral studies have explored the potential pharmacological modulation of FN3K activity. For example, substrate analogs such as 1-deoxy-1-morpholinofructose (DMF) have been used to competitively inhibit FN3K, thereby leading to increased glycation levels, which underscores the enzyme’s critical role in protein maintenance (tsai2006anewinhibitor pages 1-2, szwergold2007fructosamine3kinaserelatedproteinphosphorylatesglucitolamines pages 1-2). FN3K has also been investigated with regard to its involvement in diabetic complications, as aberrant glycation and impaired deglycation are associated with increased formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) that contribute to tissue damage in diabetes (avemaria2015possibleroleof pages 1-2, szwergold2011thephysiologicalsubstrates pages 1-2). Given these disease associations, FN3K represents a potential therapeutic target for interventions aimed at mitigating glycation-induced cellular dysfunction, although the development of highly specific inhibitors remains a challenge due to the enzyme’s unique substrate selectivity and regulatory properties (tsai2006anewinhibitor pages 1-2).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nSerine/threonine‐protein kinase DCLK1, also known by its gene aliases DCAMKL1, DCDC3A and KIAA0369, is positioned within the serine/threonine kinase superfamily and exhibits a modular organization that combines N‐terminal doublecortin (DCX) domains with a C‐terminal catalytic kinase module (burgess2001cleavageofdoublecortinlike pages 4-5). The DCX domains are evolutionarily conserved across vertebrates and are characteristic of the doublecortin protein family, which plays crucial roles in microtubule stabilization, neuronal migration and axonal elongation during brain development (burgess2002alternativesplicevariants pages 1-2). Comparative sequence analyses have revealed that the catalytic domain of DCLK1 shares approximately 45% sequence identity with related CaMKI and CaMKIV family kinases, positioning it as an intermediate member of the CaMK clade (burgess2002alternativesplicevariants pages 5-7, ohmae2006molecularidentificationand pages 4-5). In addition, the presence of multiple isoforms generated through alternative splicing reflects an evolutionary strategy to regulate both cytoskeletal interactions and phosphotransferase activity in a tissue‐ and developmental stage‐specific manner (burgess2002alternativesplicevariants pages 7-9). Phylogenetic studies based on sequence analysis and domain architecture have established that DCLK1 orthologs are broadly distributed among mammalian species and that its unique domain combination is conserved in proteins involved in microtubule regulation for neuronal migration (reiner2006theevolvingdoublecortin pages 11-12, venkat2023mechanisticandevolutionary pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nDCLK1 functions as a serine/threonine kinase that catalyzes the transfer of the γ‐phosphate from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins (patel2016biochemicalandstructural pages 1-3). In chemical terms, its enzymatic activity can be summarized by the reaction:  \n  ATP + [protein] – (L‐serine or L‐threonine) → ADP + [protein] – (L‐serine/threonine)‐phosphate + H⁺ (venkat2023mechanisticandevolutionary pages 2-4).  \nThe catalytic mechanism involves the proper positioning of ATP by conserved motifs within the kinase domain – including the HRD loop and the DFG motif – so that the substrate’s hydroxyl group may perform a nucleophilic attack on the γ‐phosphate, thereby yielding the phosphorylated product (patel2016biochemicalandstructural pages 3-4).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of DCLK1 is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions, with Mg²⁺ being the primary cofactor required for efficient catalysis (patel2016biochemicalandstructural pages 1-3). Magnesium ions coordinate with the phosphate moieties of ATP within the active site, stabilizing both the substrate and the transition state during the phosphotransfer reaction (patel2016biochemicalandstructural pages 1-3). This cofactor requirement is in agreement with the commonly observed dependency among serine/threonine kinases, particularly those within the CaMKI‐related family (patel2016biochemicalandstructural pages 1-3).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nDCLK1 exhibits specificity for target serine and threonine residues embedded in particular amino acid sequence environments. Although an unequivocal consensus sequence for DCLK1 substrates has not been fully delineated, available studies indicate a preference for substrates that contain clusters of basic residues – particularly arginine – in positions immediately upstream of the phosphorylatable residue (burgess2002alternativesplicevariants pages 7-9). Experimental peptide assays have demonstrated that arginine residues at the −3 and −2 positions relative to the target serine or threonine markedly enhance phosphorylation efficiency (ramkumar2018remappingthemicrotubule pages 17-19). In this context, the electrostatic interaction between positively charged arginine residues and the negatively charged catalytic pocket appears to contribute to optimal substrate positioning, yielding a substrate recognition motif that aligns with general features observed in the CaMKI/CaMKIV group (burgess2002alternativesplicevariants pages 7-9, ramkumar2018remappingthemicrotubule pages 17-19).\n\n5. Structure  \nDCLK1 is characterized by a modular structure that integrates functionally distinct domains. The N‐terminal region comprises one or more tandem doublecortin (DCX) domains; these domains typically adopt a β‐barrel or β‐grasp fold that efficiently binds tubulin dimers to promote microtubule polymerization and stabilization—a function critical for neuronal migration (burgess2001cleavageofdoublecortinlike pages 4-5, reiner2006theevolvingdoublecortin pages 4-7). Centrally, DCLK1 contains a well‐conserved serine/threonine kinase domain that is structurally divided into an N‐lobe and a C‐lobe. The N‐lobe includes the glycine‐rich loop (G‐loop) that interacts with ATP, while the C‐lobe harbors the substrate‐binding region and catalytic motifs such as the HRD and DFG motifs, which are crucial for phosphotransferase activity (patel2016biochemicalandstructural pages 1-3, shang2003catalyticandregulatory pages 1-2). Additionally, DCLK1 possesses an intrinsically disordered C‐terminal tail that serves a regulatory function; structural models and experimental data suggest that this tail can dock against the kinase domain, thereby contributing to the stabilization of the hydrophobic catalytic spine (C‐spine) and, in its docked state, occluding the ATP‐binding site to act as an autoinhibitory mechanism (venkat2023mechanisticandevolutionary pages 12-14, rogers2020autoregulatorycontrolof pages 3-5, shang2003catalyticandregulatory pages 6-7). This dual‐domain organization, coupling microtubule binding through the DCX domains with catalytic activity in the kinase domain, underlies the multifunctional nature of DCLK1 (carli2023structureguidedpredictionof pages 2-4, carli2023structureguidedpredictionof pages 8-9).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulatory mechanisms governing DCLK1 activity involve multiple layers of control that include intramolecular autophosphorylation, alternative splicing, and conformational dynamics. A principal mechanism is intramolecular autophosphorylation, wherein the kinase domain phosphorylates specific serine/threonine residues on DCLK1 itself. Autophosphorylation events, particularly within the C‐terminal tail, have been mapped using techniques such as Phos‐tag gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. These modifications can induce conformational changes that result in the docking of the C‐terminal tail against the catalytic core, effectively occluding the ATP‐binding site and functioning as an autoinhibitory signal (rogers2020autoregulatorycontrolof pages 1-3, rogers2020autoregulatorycontrolof pages 21-22, rogers2020autoregulatorycontrolof pages 22-29). Furthermore, increased phosphorylation within the DCX domains is associated with decreased microtubule binding, thereby modulating DCLK1’s interaction with the cytoskeleton (rogers2020autoregulatorycontrolof pages 3-5, rogers2020autoregulatorycontrolof pages 5-7).  \nAlternative splicing of the DCLK1 gene generates isoforms with differences in the number and arrangement of DCX domains, as well as variations in the length and composition of the regulatory C‐terminal region. These isoform‐specific variations have been shown to affect both the intrinsic kinase activity and the extent of C‐tail mediated autoinhibition, with kinetic analyses revealing changes in ATP affinity and catalytic turnover between isoforms (burgess2002alternativesplicevariants pages 1-2, rogers2021autoregulatorycontrolof pages 1-2, rogers2021autoregulatorycontrolof pages 11-12, rogers2021autoregulatorycontrolof pages 15-17, rogers2021autoregulatorycontrolof pages 2-4, rogers2021autoregulatorycontrolof pages 5-6, rogers2021autoregulatorycontrolof pages 9-11). These regulatory pathways ensure that DCLK1 activity is tightly controlled according to cellular context and developmental stage, balancing the requirements for microtubule stabilization with the need for dynamic phosphosignaling.\n\n7. Function  \nDCLK1 exerts dual functionalities that integrate its role as a microtubule‐associated protein with its serine/threonine kinase activity. During neuronal development, the DCX domains of DCLK1 bind to microtubules to facilitate their polymerization and stabilization, processes that are essential for neuronal migration, axon guidance, and the proper positioning of neurons during brain development (burgess2001cleavageofdoublecortinlike pages 4-5, ohmae2006molecularidentificationand pages 4-5, reiner2006theevolvingdoublecortin pages 11-12). Concurrently, the kinase activity of DCLK1 is capable of phosphorylating substrates that may further influence cytoskeletal dynamics, thereby modulating processes such as neurite outgrowth and dendritic patterning (burgess2002alternativesplicevariants pages 7-9, ramkumar2018remappingthemicrotubule pages 17-19).  \nIn mature neurons, DCLK1 contributes to the maintenance of neuronal polarity and dendritic architecture through its impact on microtubule stability and associated signaling pathways. The integration of its microtubule‐binding function with autophosphorylation‐mediated regulation of kinase activity enables DCLK1 to participate in the remodeling of dendritic spines and the regulation of synaptic plasticity. This dual activity is critical for maintaining the structural integrity and functional modulation of neuronal circuits (chhetri2022pleiotropiceffectsof pages 2-3).  \nBeyond its roles in the nervous system, alterations in DCLK1 expression and splicing have been observed in various cancers. Overexpression and aberrant splicing of DCLK1 isoforms have been associated with enhanced migratory and invasive characteristics in tumor cells, implicating DCLK1 in oncogenic processes that involve both cytoskeletal reorganization and altered phosphorylation signaling networks (burgess2002alternativesplicevariants pages 7-9). These observations position DCLK1 as a protein that bridges fundamental aspects of neurodevelopment with mechanisms that may contribute to tumorigenesis.\n\n8. Other Comments  \nDCLK1’s distinctive combination of tandem DCX domains and a serine/threonine kinase domain renders it clinically significant, particularly in the context of cancer biology. Aberrant expression and alternative splicing patterns of DCLK1 have been correlated with aggressive tumor phenotypes and enhanced cancer stem cell properties in several cancer types such as colorectal, pancreatic and gastric cancers (chhetri2022pleiotropiceffectsof pages 2-3). The absence of a canonical calmodulin‐binding domain in DCLK1 distinguishes its regulation from other CaMKI‐like kinases, placing a greater emphasis on autophosphorylation and C‐terminal tail docking as mechanisms for controlling activity (rogers2020autoregulatorycontrolof pages 1-3, rogers2021autoregulatorycontrolof pages 1-2).  \nThis autoinhibitory regulation mediated by the C‐terminal tail forms the basis for ongoing research into novel therapeutic strategies, including the design of small‐molecule inhibitors that target the conserved ATP‐binding site or disrupt the autoinhibitory docking interactions. Furthermore, differential splicing and isoform expression of DCLK1 continue to be examined as potential biomarkers for disease progression and therapeutic response, underscoring the need for isoform‐selective inhibitors in a clinical context (venkat2023mechanisticandevolutionary pages 17-18, venkat2023mechanisticandevolutionary pages 18-19, rogers2021autoregulatorycontrolof pages 9-11).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nDCLK2 (gene symbol DCLK2; also known as DCAMKL2, DCDC3B, or DCK2) belongs to the doublecortin (DCX) family of serine/threonine kinases. It is evolutionarily related to other members of this family, including DCLK1 and DCLK3, and shares a common ancestry with proteins harboring tandem DCX domains fused to a kinase domain. The DCX family is broadly conserved among vertebrates, and DCLK2 can be traced to common ancestors within the metazoan lineage, similar to other CaMK-like kinases that have undergone diversification in their regulatory and catalytic properties (reiner2006theevolvingdoublecortin pages 11-12, hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 1-3).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nDCLK2 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine and/or threonine residues on substrate proteins. In chemical terms, the reaction is as follows:  \nATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 10-11).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nLike many serine/threonine kinases, DCLK2 requires divalent metal ions—most notably Mg²⁺—as a cofactor for catalytic activity. Although members of the CaMK family typically demonstrate calcium/calmodulin responsiveness, DCLK2 is characterized by a significantly reduced Ca²⁺/calmodulin affinity and dependence compared to canonical CaMKs (hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 10-11).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nDCLK2 exhibits a high degree of substrate specificity. In studies of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), DCLK2 was shown to selectively phosphorylate TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) on serine 172—a modification that is essential for TBK1 activation in an oncogenic signaling cascade. Importantly, DCLK2 does not phosphorylate the closely related kinase IKKε at the corresponding site, underscoring its substrate selectivity (hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 10-11). In addition, activation of TBK1 by DCLK2 initiates downstream phosphorylation events, such as the TBK1-dependent phosphorylation of p62 on serine 366, further delineating a distinct substrate specificity that appears restricted to components of this signaling pathway (hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 10-11).\n\n5. Structure  \nDCLK2 is a modular protein that comprises distinct structural domains. The N-terminal portion contains one or more doublecortin (DCX) domains, which serve to mediate microtubule binding and are characteristic of the DCX superfamily. The tandem DCX repeats are thought to facilitate microtubule stabilization and bundling, similar to other family members (reiner2006theevolvingdoublecortin pages 11-12). The C-terminal region of DCLK2 contains the serine/threonine kinase domain. Within this catalytic domain, a conserved lysine residue (K423 in functional studies) is critical for ATP binding and phosphotransfer, as mutation of this residue to alanine (K423A) abrogates kinase activity and the ability to phosphorylate TBK1 (hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 10-11). Notably, DCLK2 isoforms show structural differences; for example, the predominant isoform in ccRCC, designated DCLK2203, lacks an auto-inhibitory C-terminal threonine residue that is present in alternate isoforms such as DCLK2201. The absence of this regulatory residue correlates with increased kinase activity, suggesting that the structural architecture of the C-terminal domain plays a critical role in modulating catalysis (hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 10-11). Overall, although DCLK2 shares the canonical CaMK-like kinase fold, it is distinguished by a reduced reliance on calcium/calmodulin binding and by isoform-specific variations in regulatory motifs.\n\n6. Regulation  \nDCLK2 is regulated at multiple levels. Alternative splicing generates different isoforms with distinct regulatory properties. For example, the DCLK2203 isoform, which predominates in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), lacks an auto-inhibitory C-terminal threonine residue that is present in other isoforms such as DCLK2201. This molecular difference results in markedly higher kinase activity for DCLK2203, as demonstrated by its ability to phosphorylate TBK1 efficiently (hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 10-11). In addition, the catalytic activity of DCLK2 relies on an intact kinase domain, with point mutations (e.g., K423A) rendering the enzyme catalytically dead and unable to support oncogenic processes such as anchorage-independent growth or xenograft tumor formation (hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 10-11). Regulation may also occur at the post-transcriptional level; for example, there is evidence suggesting that reduced expression of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) factor UPF1 in ccRCC can lead to increased expression of the hyperactive DCLK2203 isoform (hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 10-11). While direct evidence of phosphorylation sites within DCLK2 (aside from its substrate TBK1 phosphorylation site) is not detailed in the available excerpts, autophosphorylation events and alternative splicing clearly contribute to its overall regulatory profile.\n\n7. Function  \nDCLK2 functions as a serine/threonine kinase involved in oncogenic signaling. In studies focused on clear cell renal cell carcinoma, DCLK2 was identified as a critical regulator of TBK1 activity. It phosphorylates TBK1 on serine 172 within the activation loop, a modification that is essential for the activation of TBK1 and subsequent downstream signaling. Activated TBK1 is implicated in promoting the phosphorylation of p62 on serine 366, which supports an oncogenic cascade that drives tumor cell growth and metastasis (hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 10-11). Functionally, depletion of DCLK2 reduces anchorage-independent colony formation in vitro and impairs tumor growth in xenograft models, underscoring its role as a tumor-promoting kinase (hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 1-3). In addition, despite its structural similarity to CaMKs, DCLK2 is characterized by a significantly reduced Ca²⁺/calmodulin affinity; consequently, its function is largely independent of calcium regulation. By phosphorylating specific substrates such as TBK1—and, by similarity to other family members, potentially the CREB coactivator CRTC2/TORC2—DCLK2 is involved in the modulation of transcriptional responses related to cell proliferation (hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 10-11). In ccRCC, the oncogenic role of DCLK2 is further supported by genomics and functional screening data, which highlight it as a candidate therapeutic target whose inhibition may selectively down-regulate TBK1 activity while sparing related innate immune pathways (hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 1-3).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nRecent efforts to develop selective inhibitors for the doublecortin-like kinase family have yielded compounds such as DCLK1-IN-1, which also inhibit DCLK2 with high selectivity, providing experimental chemical probes for modulating kinase activity in cancer cells (ferguson2020discoveryofa pages 1-2). Known mutations and structure–function studies indicate that alteration of key catalytic residues, such as mutation of K423, abrogates kinase activity, and such mutations have been instrumental in elucidating the functional importance of DCLK2 in oncogenic signaling (hu2024kinomewidesirnascreen pages 10-11). Furthermore, the differential regulation of DCLK2 isoforms via alternative splicing and mRNA decay mechanisms suggests that post-transcriptional controls contribute significantly to its activity and expression in tumor cells. In addition to clear cell renal cell carcinoma, although not detailed in the current excerpts, DCLK family members have been implicated in diverse biological processes including neuronal development and microtubule dynamics. However, the primary experimental evidence for DCLK2 points to its role as an oncogenic kinase involved in the activation of TBK1. These properties and the selective inhibition by emerging chemical probes underscore the potential of DCLK2 both as a therapeutic target in cancer and as a tool for further dissecting kinase-substrate relationships within the doublecortin family.\n\n9.

Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nBRSK1, also known as SAD-B or Brain‐selective kinase 1, is a member of the AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK)–related kinase family and is classified within the larger serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) kinase superfamily. Members of this family are evolutionarily conserved across metazoans, with orthologs described in mammals as well as in lower organisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila; these kinases trace their lineage back to a common ancestral AMP‐activated kinase that has diversified in animal evolution (bright2008investigatingtheregulation pages 1-1, 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nBRSK1 catalyzes the phosphorylation reaction in which a phosphate group is transferred from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the hydroxyl group of a serine or threonine residue in target proteins. The overall chemical reaction can be represented as follows:  \n  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺  \nThis classical kinase reaction underlies the post-translational modification processes regulated by BRSK1 (bright2008investigatingtheregulation pages 8-9).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of BRSK1, like that of other serine/threonine kinases, is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions which serve as essential cofactors. In general, magnesium ions (Mg²⁺) are required to coordinate ATP binding and to facilitate the phosphate-transfer reaction. This dependency on Mg²⁺ is a common feature among protein kinases and is central to the catalytic mechanism of BRSK1 (bright2008investigatingtheregulation pages 2-3).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nBRSK1 phosphorylates a number of downstream substrates that are crucial for neuronal polarization, cell cycle regulation, and centrosome duplication. Notably, BRSK1 is known to phosphorylate:\n • CDC25B and CDC25C, which are key regulators of cell cycle progression by mediating dephosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinases;  \n • MAPT/TAU, a microtubule-associated protein, where phosphorylation events (for example, reported at Thr-529 and Ser-579) modulate microtubule binding properties;  \n • RIMS1, a component implicated in synaptic vesicle regulation;  \n • TUBG1 and TUBG2 (gamma-tubulins), whose phosphorylation is involved in the control of centrosome duplication; and  \n • WEE1, a kinase that is inhibited upon phosphorylation at Ser-642, thereby affecting cell cycle checkpoints in postmitotic neurons.  \nAlthough no single consensus sequence has been definitively established for BRSK1 from the current context, these substrates contain target serine or threonine residues embedded within motifs that support efficient recognition and catalysis by BRSK1 (bright2008investigatingtheregulation pages 8-9).\n\n5. Structure  \nBRSK1 displays a modular domain organization that is characteristic of the AMPK-related kinase family. The N-terminal region contains the canonical serine/threonine kinase domain, which encompasses several conserved motifs, including the nucleotide-binding GxGxxG motif located in the N-terminal lobe, the critical VAIK motif for ATP positioning, and the activation loop (T-loop) where phosphorylation at a conserved threonine residue (Thr189 in human BRSK1) is essential for catalytic activation. This kinase domain also harbors unique redox-sensitive cysteine residues; experimental studies using recombinant proteins have demonstrated that these cysteines can form intramolecular disulfide bonds under oxidative conditions, thereby modulating enzymatic activity (bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 5-7).  \n\nFollowing the catalytic domain is a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain. Although in many kinases the UBA domain is traditionally implicated in binding ubiquitin, in BRSK1 it is believed to function as a regulatory module that helps maintain an open conformation of the kinase and may also confer stability or influence subcellular localization. In addition, BRSK1 possesses a proline-rich region (PRR) and a kinase-associated (KA1) domain at its C-terminus; the KA1 domain typically contains an autoinhibitory sequence (AIS) that can interact with the kinase domain to modulate its activity. A distinctive structural feature of BRSK1 compared with canonical Ser/Thr kinases is the presence of a CPE motif in the activation segment instead of the more common APE motif. This substitution results in a unique arrangement of cysteine residues that are involved in reversible oxidation events, which add an additional layer of regulatory control under varying redox conditions (bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 5-7, 7-9).\n\nThe overall three-dimensional structure, as suggested by AlphaFold models and supported by biochemical studies, indicates that the central kinase domain forms the catalytic core, with its regulatory domains flanking this core to ensure proper spatial-temporal regulation. Key catalytic features include the phosphoacceptor site in the T-loop, a hydrophobic spine that stabilizes the active conformation, and a well-defined C-helix that is essential for coordinating the catalytic machinery. The redox-sensitive cysteine residues that are strategically located near the T-loop and within the CPE motif contribute to both the conformational flexibility and the redox-dependent modulation of kinase activity (bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 7-9).\n\n6. Regulation  \nBRSK1 is subject to multiple regulatory inputs that converge to control its kinase activity in a spatial and temporal manner. One principal mechanism involves phosphorylation by the upstream kinase LKB1. LKB1, which is constitutively active, phosphorylates a conserved threonine residue (Thr189 in BRSK1) in the activation loop, a modification that is essential for enzyme activation and subsequent substrate phosphorylation (bright2008investigatingtheregulation pages 1-2, 8-9).  \n\nIn addition to this phosphorylation event, BRSK1 is dynamically regulated by the cellular redox state. Several studies have demonstrated that reducing agents such as dithiothreitol (DTT) enhance BRSK1 kinase activity, whereas oxidizing conditions brought about by agents like hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) result in significant inhibition of its catalytic function. The underlying mechanism is based on the reversible oxidation of conserved cysteine residues within the kinase domain. These cysteines can form intramolecular disulfide bonds under oxidative conditions, which sterically hinder the proper arrangement of the catalytic segments and reduce enzyme activity; conversely, reduction of these disulfide bonds restores the active conformation of the kinase (bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 5-7, 7-9, 14-15).\n\nThis dual regulation—via phosphorylation on the T-loop and via cysteine oxidation—provides BRSK1 with a sensitive mechanism to integrate metabolic and redox signals in neuronal cells, thereby coordinating cellular responses to energy levels and oxidative stress without the need for additional upstream signals.\n\n7. Function  \nBRSK1 plays a critical role in the regulation of several cellular processes, particularly in neurons where it is predominantly expressed. As a serine/threonine–protein kinase, BRSK1 phosphorylates a variety of substrates that are directly involved in the establishment and maintenance of neuronal polarity. For instance, phosphorylation of MAPT/TAU influences microtubule dynamics, which is essential for axon specification and synaptic function. In addition, BRSK1 phosphorylates CDC25B and CDC25C, which are key regulators of the cell cycle, thereby contributing to the checkpoint response during the UV-induced DNA damage response.  \n\nBRSK1 also phosphorylates WEE1 at Ser-642 in postmitotic neurons; this phosphorylation event down-regulates WEE1 activity and is associated with the maintenance of neuronal polarity. Another important substrate is represented by gamma-tubulin isoforms TUBG1 and TUBG2, whose phosphorylation by BRSK1 is fundamental for centrosome duplication and the proper translocation of gamma-tubulin complexes to the centrosome. Moreover, BRSK1 has been implicated in the regulation of neurotransmitter release through its phosphorylation of RIMS1 in synaptic vesicles, thereby affecting synaptic signaling in the central nervous system (bright2008investigatingtheregulation pages 8-9).\n\nThe tissue-specific expression of BRSK1 is highly enriched in the brain, where it coordinates several signaling pathways critical for neuronal development and function. By integrating cues from metabolic and redox signals via its unique regulatory mechanisms, BRSK1 acts as a pivotal node in pathways that regulate cell polarity, synaptic transmission, and cell cycle progression in neural tissues.\n\n8. Other Comments  \nCurrently, no highly selective inhibitors have been established specifically for BRSK1. However, research on inhibitors targeting related members of the AMPK-related kinase family suggests that compounds such as GW296115, which has been shown to inhibit BRSK2 in cellular studies, might serve as a starting point for the development of BRSK1 inhibitors (tamir2020gainoffunctiongeneticscreen pages 3-5). In addition, the dysregulation of BRSK1 activity has functional implications in neurodegenerative processes due to its role in TAU phosphorylation, as well as in cell cycle regulation through its effects on CDC25 phosphatases and WEE1. Although direct disease mutations in BRSK1 have not been extensively documented in the available literature, defects in upstream regulators such as LKB1 have been linked to various cancers. Thus, aberrant BRSK1 signaling may contribute to pathological conditions associated with defects in neuronal polarity and centrosome duplication (bright2008investigatingtheregulation pages 8-9, bendzunas2025redoxregulationand pages 7-9).\n\n9.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nBRSK2, also known as Brain‐selective kinase 2, Brain‐specific serine/threonine‐protein kinase 2, STK29, SAD-A, and PEN11B, belongs to the CAMK (calcium/calmodulin‐dependent protein kinase) group of serine/threonine kinases and is classified within the AMPK‐related subfamily. Its evolutionary conservation is demonstrated by the presence of an ortholog in Caenorhabditis elegans known as Sad-1, and its close paralog BRSK1 is also found in vertebrates. BRSK2’s phylogenetic context positions it among kinases that regulate neuronal functions, with its evolutionary relationships being delineated by studies that trace kinase families from yeast to man (jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 12-14, asiain2012regulaciónyfunción pages 82-89, babot2014regulaciódela pages 221-225).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nBRSK2 catalyzes the phosphorylation reaction in which ATP and a protein substrate containing serine or threonine residues are converted to ADP and the phosphorylated protein along with the release of a proton. Thus, its catalytic activity can be summarized by the following reaction: ATP + [protein]-(Ser/Thr) → ADP + [protein]-(Ser/Thr)-phosphate + H⁺ (jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 12-14).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe enzymatic activity of BRSK2 is dependent on divalent metal ions, with magnesium ion (Mg²⁺) being required as the essential cofactor. In kinase assays, the presence of Mg²⁺ facilitates the binding of ATP and proper substrate turnover, while experimental evidence from related serine/threonine kinases indicates that manganese (Mn²⁺) can also support catalytic activity, albeit with different kinetic parameters (knape2017divalentmetalions pages 7-8, li2012apcccdh1targetsbrainspecific pages 3-4).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nBRSK2 exhibits substrate specificity that is characterized by a consensus assembly of amino acid preferences surrounding the phosphorylation site. Deep learning-based analyses have predicted that the consensus phosphorylation motif for BRSK2 includes a preference for a non-polar amino acid at the −5 position relative to the target serine or threonine, basic residues (arginine and lysine) at the −3 and −2 positions, and acidic residues (aspartic acid and glutamic acid) from the +1 through +3 positions (jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 12-14). In addition, BRSK2 phosphorylates several substrates that play critical roles in neuronal polarity and cell cycle regulation, including MAPT/TAU, CDC25C, WEE1, CDK16, and PAK1 (tamir2020gainoffunctiongeneticscreen pages 3-5, jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 12-14).\n\n5. Structure  \nBRSK2 is composed of multiple conserved domains that determine its catalytic and regulatory functions. The protein has an N‐terminal kinase domain that contains the conserved catalytic core essential for ATP binding and phosphoryl transfer. Within this domain, critical structural features such as the activation loop are present; phosphorylation of the activation loop residue (Thr-174) is necessary for kinase activation. Following the kinase domain, BRSK2 contains a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain that contributes to an autoinhibitory mechanism. This UBA domain, along with an auto-inhibitory sequence (AIS) that is part of the C-terminal kinase-associated 1 (KA1) domain, cooperatively maintain the kinase in an inactive conformation by positioning the αC helix in an “αC-out” conformation (wu2015structuralinsightinto pages 1-2, wu2015structuralinsightinto pages 6-7, tamir2020gainoffunctiongeneticscreen pages 3-5). Additionally, BRSK2 harbors a proline-rich region (PRR) between the UBA and KA1 domains. The modular organization—with a catalytic core followed by regulatory domains that mediate auto-inhibition and likely membrane localization—parallels the domain architecture observed in other AMPK-related kinases (jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 4-7, babot2014regulaciódela pages 221-225).\n\n6. Regulation  \nActivation of BRSK2 is primarily controlled by post-translational phosphorylation. The upstream kinase STK11 (also known as LKB1) phosphorylates BRSK2 at a conserved threonine residue in its activation loop (Thr-174), which is critical for relieving autoinhibition and activating the kinase (li2012apcccdh1targetsbrainspecific pages 5-8, thiriet2013cytoplasmicproteinserinethreonine pages 76-78). In addition to LKB1-mediated phosphorylation, BRSK2 is differentially phosphorylated at other residues with distinct functional outcomes; for instance, phosphorylation at Thr-174 has been shown to inhibit insulin secretion, whereas phosphorylation at Thr-260 promotes insulin secretion (information provided in the protein function description). Furthermore, BRSK2 is regulated via ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation mediated by the APC/C complex through recognition of a conserved KEN box motif, thereby modulating its stability during cell cycle progression (li2012apcccdh1targetsbrainspecific pages 3-4). Autoinhibition mediated by the UBA domain and the AIS within the KA1 domain contributes to conformational control, ensuring that kinase activity is tightly regulated until appropriate upstream signals relieve this inhibition (wu2015structuralinsightinto pages 6-7, tamir2020gainoffunctiongeneticscreen pages 3-5).\n\n7. Function  \nBRSK2 plays key roles in several fundamental cellular processes. It is critically involved in neuronal polarization and axonogenesis, where its phosphorylation of substrates such as the microtubule-associated protein Tau (MAPT/TAU) at specific residues (e.g., Thr-529 and Ser-579) contributes to the establishment and maintenance of neuronal polarity (jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 12-14, thiriet2013cytoplasmicproteinserinethreonine pages 76-78). In postmitotic neurons, BRSK2 phosphorylates the cell cycle regulator WEE1 at Ser-642, leading to its down-regulation and thereby influencing the transition from the G2 phase to mitosis in developing neurons (jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 12-14, tamir2020gainoffunctiongeneticscreen pages 3-5). Moreover, BRSK2 is implicated in cell cycle progression through its regulation of CDC25C and in the modulation of insulin secretion via phosphorylation of CDK16 and PAK1. Differential phosphorylation events on BRSK2 (for instance, at Thr-174 versus Thr-260) yield opposing effects on insulin secretion in response to elevated glucose levels (information provided in the protein function description, tamir2020gainoffunctiongeneticscreen pages 5-6). BRSK2 also plays roles in reorganizing the actin cytoskeleton and may participate in apoptotic responses triggered by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Expression of BRSK2 is primarily observed in neuronal tissues, although it has also been reported in certain tumor cell lines, indicating its multifunctionality across different cell types (li2012apcccdh1targetsbrainspecific pages 5-8, tamir2020gainoffunctiongeneticscreen pages 3-5).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nBRSK2 has been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders; genetic variants in BRSK2 have been associated with developmental delay, autism spectrum disorders, and intellectual disability (jha2025deeplearningcoupledproximity pages 12-14). Despite its critical biological roles, selective small-molecule inhibitors that target BRSK2 remain underdeveloped, and there are currently no widely accepted tool compounds for therapeutic modulation of this kinase (liu2021leveragingdiversedata pages 56-60, moret2020aresourcefor pages 17-20, tamir2020gainoffunctiongeneticscreen pages 8-9). In addition, altered BRSK2 activity has been observed to influence cell cycle progression and insulin secretion, linking it to metabolic regulation and potentially to oncogenic processes observed in certain cancers. The modulation of BRSK2 via phosphorylation by upstream kinases such as LKB1 and its regulation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway further underscore the complexity of its control mechanisms. The potential for targeting the kinase–substrate interactions of BRSK2 in disease contexts, particularly in neurological and metabolic disorders, remains an area of active investigation (banerjee2013phosphorylationubiquitylationand pages 35-39, southekal2021integrativeanalysisof pages 114-120).\n\n9.

Constitutes the main protein kinase for extracellular proteins, generating the majority of the extracellular phosphoproteome (PubMed:26091039). Mainly phosphorylates proteins within the Ser-x-Glu/pSer motif, but also displays a broader substrate specificity (PubMed:26091039). Phosphorylates ERO1A, enhancing its activity which is required to maintain endoplasmic reticulum redox homeostasis and for oxidative protein folding (PubMed:29858230, PubMed:34349020). During endoplasmic reticulum stress, phosphorylates P4HB/PDIA1 which induces a functional switch, causing P4HB to change from an oxidoreductase to a molecular chaperone (PubMed:32149426). This is critical to maintain ER proteostasis and reduce cell death under ER stress (PubMed:32149426). Phosphorylation of P4HB also promotes its interaction with ERN1, leading to reduced activity of ERN1, a key sensor for the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response (PubMed:32149426). Required for osteoblast differentiation and mineralization (PubMed:34349020). Phosphorylates casein as well as a number of proteins involved in biomineralization such as AMELX, AMTN, ENAM and SPP1/OPN (PubMed:22582013, PubMed:25789606, PubMed:34349020). In addition to its role in biomineralization, also plays a role in lipid homeostasis, wound healing and cell migration and adhesion (PubMed:26091039)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nExtracellular serine/threonine protein kinase FAM20C belongs to the FAM20 family of secretory kinases, which also includes Fam20A and Fam20B. FAM20C orthologs have been identified across a range of species, including Caenorhabditis elegans (ceFam20), Danio rerio (drFam20C), and Hydra magnipapillata, reflecting a high degree of evolutionary conservation in the kinase domain and overall fold (zhang2018structureandevolution pages 1-2, cui2017structureoffam20a pages 1-2). Phylogenetic analyses indicate that the Fam20 kinases form a distinct clade within the human kinome that diverges from canonical protein kinases and is primarily associated with the secretory pathway. This family is evolutionarily related to ancient kinases, having undergone diversification that culminated in functionally distinct members: Fam20B, a glycosylation-related xylosylkinase, and Fam20C, which functions as a bona fide protein kinase (filatova2015theroleof pages 17-20, zhang2018structureandevolution pages 2-3). The evolutionary studies based on sequence alignments and structural modelling further suggest that the emergence of Fam20C coincided with the advent of vertebrate-specific biomineralization processes, consistent with its key role in bone and tooth formation (palmalara2023potentialroleof pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nFAM20C catalyzes the phosphorylation of serine/threonine residues in secreted substrates. The chemical reaction can be described as follows:  \nATP + [protein]–(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]–(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺.  \nThis reaction occurs predominantly on secretory proteins, thereby generating the majority of the extracellular phosphoproteome (xu2021fam20cinhuman pages 1-2, da2019invitrophosphorylation pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of FAM20C depends on divalent cations for optimal ATP binding and catalysis. Although many kinases utilize magnesium ions (Mg²⁺), FAM20C exhibits a preference for manganese ions (Mn²⁺), which enhance its catalytic efficiency in the Golgi environment (zhang2018secretorykinasefam20c pages 1-2, xiao2013crystalstructureof pages 1-1).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nFAM20C phosphorylates secretory pathway proteins with a high degree of substrate specificity. Its primary consensus phosphorylation motif is Ser-x-Glu/pSer, where ‘x’ represents any amino acid. In addition to this canonical motif, FAM20C demonstrates a broader substrate specificity and is capable of phosphorylating residues within similar variants such as Ser-x-Sp motifs, as observed in secreted salivary proteins (messana2023theposttranslationalmodifications pages 12-13, cui2015asecretorykinase pages 1-2). The specificity for these motifs underlies the enzyme’s role in modulating phosphorylation patterns on proteins involved in biomineralization, extracellular matrix remodeling, and additional extracellular processes (palmalara2023potentialroleof pages 9-10).\n\n5. Structure  \nFAM20C is synthesized with an N-terminal signal peptide that directs the polypeptide into the secretory pathway, where the mature enzyme is predominantly localized to the Golgi apparatus. The mature protein contains a central kinase domain that adopts a two-lobed structure characteristic of the protein kinase-like (PKL) fold. Within this domain, key structural features include a glycine-rich loop that covers the ATP-binding pocket, a catalytic loop with a conserved aspartate residue, and an αC helix that contributes to the proper positioning of residues involved in catalysis (filatova2015theroleof pages 20-24, xiao2013crystalstructureof pages 1-3).  \nCrystal structures of Fam20 family orthologs, such as ceFam20 from Caenorhabditis elegans, reveal that the catalytic core is flanked by an N-terminal segment and an insertion domain. The N-terminal segment wraps around the lower half of the molecule and forms the base of the C-lobe, whereas the insertion domain forms a cap-like structure over the N-lobe. Unique features of FAM20C’s structural organization include the absence of a canonical activation loop, which contributes to its constitutive catalytic activity, and specific residue substitutions (e.g., within the glycine-rich loop) that determine the enzyme’s binding orientation for ATP and substrate peptides (xiao2013crystalstructureof pages 4-5, xiao2013crystalstructureof pages 5-6).  \nAlphaFold-predicted models further reinforce these observations by illustrating that FAM20C retains the overall kinase fold with a well-defined ATP-binding site and conserved catalytic residues, while also accommodating secretory pathway-specific modifications such as potential glycosylation and disulfide bonds that are essential for its stability and function in the Golgi (xu2021fam20cinhuman pages 1-2, cui2017structureoffam20a pages 2-5).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulation of FAM20C activity is mediated by several mechanisms that ensure precise control over extracellular protein phosphorylation. A key regulatory mechanism involves the formation of homo- or heterodimeric complexes. Fam20A, a closely related pseudokinase that lacks key catalytic residues, acts as an allosteric activator of FAM20C by forming a complex that enhances its kinase activity (cui2015asecretorykinase pages 11-13, cui2017structureoffam20a pages 15-16). This dimerization not only potentiates enzymatic activity but also contributes to the stabilization of FAM20C, including mutant forms that are associated with disease phenotypes.  \nIn addition to its regulation by Fam20A, FAM20C exhibits autophosphorylation events that may play a role in modulating its activity within the Golgi, as suggested by studies on its kinase parameters (ishikawa2012therainesyndrome pages 1-2). Under conditions of endoplasmic reticulum stress, FAM20C also phosphorylates specific ER-resident proteins such as P4HB/PDIA1; this post-translational modification induces a functional switch in P4HB from an oxidoreductase to a molecular chaperone and contributes to the overall maintenance of ER proteostasis (liu2023fam20cregulatesthe pages 19-20, cui2015asecretorykinase pages 1-2).  \nThe regulatory network further extends to the modulation of redox homeostasis via the phosphorylation of ERO1A, which enhances its oxidase activity and is required for oxidative protein folding. This phosphorylation event is crucial for maintaining the ER redox state under various stress conditions (fulcher2020functionsandregulation pages 14-15, xu2021fam20cinhuman pages 1-2).\n\n7. Function  \nFAM20C plays a central role in the phosphorylation of secretory proteins, thereby contributing to a wide array of physiological processes. Its most well‐characterized role is in biomineralization, where it phosphorylates proteins such as casein, amelogenin (AMELX), ameloblastin (AMTN), enamelin (ENAM), and osteopontin (SPP1/OPN) to regulate the formation and mineralization of bone and dental tissues (filatova2015theroleof pages 20-24, xiao2013crystalstructureof pages 5-6).  \nIn addition to its functions in bone and tooth formation, FAM20C is critical in maintaining endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis. By phosphorylating ERO1A, FAM20C enhances oxidative protein folding, which is essential for proper ER function. Under stress conditions, phosphorylation of P4HB/PDIA1 alters its functional role, thereby reducing ER stress and preventing cell death (liu2023fam20cregulatesthe pages 19-20, xu2021fam20cinhuman pages 1-2).  \nFAM20C is also involved in lipid homeostasis, wound healing, and the regulation of cell migration and adhesion through phosphorylation of a broad spectrum of extracellular proteins; this activity establishes FAM20C as the principal kinase responsible for generating the secreted phosphoproteome (palmalara2023potentialroleof pages 1-2, brutsch2022thesecretedkinase pages 37-41). A consequence of its central role is that mutations or loss-of-function events in FAM20C are linked to severe developmental disorders, most notably Raine syndrome, which is characterized by osteosclerotic dysplasia, hypophosphatemia, and defects in bone mineralization (ishikawa2012therainesyndrome pages 1-2, palmalara2023potentialroleof pages 10-13).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nFAM20C is known by several alternative names including Dentin Matrix Protein 4 (DMP4), Golgi casein kinase, and Golgi-enriched fraction casein kinase. Although inhibitors specifically targeting FAM20C are not extensively characterized, experimental data indicate that the enzyme is insensitive to broad-spectrum kinase inhibitors such as staurosporine, suggesting a unique inhibitor profile (zhang2018secretorykinasefam20c pages 1-2).  \nClinically, mutations in FAM20C are associated with Raine syndrome, a rare skeletal dysplasia that can present in both lethal and non-lethal forms. These mutations typically disrupt key residues within the kinase domain, leading to impaired substrate phosphorylation and subsequent defects in biomineralization processes. In addition, FAM20C dysfunction has been implicated in dental anomalies due to its role in enamel formation (filatova2015theroleof pages 17-20, palmalara2023potentialroleof pages 13-14).  \nThe enzyme’s broad substrate repertoire also extends into pathways involved in cell adhesion and migration, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases related to extracellular matrix dysregulation (du2023regulationofsecretory pages 4-5). Further research into the development of specific inhibitors may provide new avenues for modulating FAM20C activity in pathological contexts.\n\n9.

In response to reduction of intracellular ATP levels, AMPK activates energy-producing pathways and inhibits energy-consuming processes: inhibits protein, carbohydrate and lipid biosynthesis, as well as cell growth and proliferation (PubMed:17307971, PubMed:17712357). AMPK acts via direct phosphorylation of metabolic enzymes, and by longer-term effects via phosphorylation of transcription regulators (PubMed:17307971, PubMed:17712357). Regulates lipid synthesis by phosphorylating and inactivating lipid metabolic enzymes such as ACACA, ACACB, GYS1, HMGCR and LIPE; regulates fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis by phosphorylating acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACACA and ACACB) and hormone-sensitive lipase (LIPE) enzymes, respectively (By similarity). Promotes lipolysis of lipid droplets by mediating phosphorylation of isoform 1 of CHKA (CHKalpha2) (PubMed:34077757). Regulates insulin-signaling and glycolysis by phosphorylating IRS1, PFKFB2 and PFKFB3 (By similarity). AMPK stimulates glucose uptake in muscle by increasing the translocation of the glucose transporter SLC2A4/GLUT4 to the plasma membrane, possibly by mediating phosphorylation of TBC1D4/AS160 (By similarity). Regulates transcription and chromatin structure by phosphorylating transcription regulators involved in energy metabolism such as CRTC2/TORC2, FOXO3, histone H2B, HDAC5, MEF2C, MLXIPL/ChREBP, EP300, HNF4A, p53/TP53, SREBF1, SREBF2 and PPARGC1A (PubMed:11518699, PubMed:11554766, PubMed:15866171, PubMed:17711846, PubMed:18184930). Acts as a key regulator of glucose homeostasis in liver by phosphorylating CRTC2/TORC2, leading to CRTC2/TORC2 sequestration in the cytoplasm (By similarity). In response to stress, phosphorylates 'Ser-36' of histone H2B (H2BS36ph), leading to promote transcription (By similarity). Acts as a key regulator of cell growth and proliferation by phosphorylating FNIP1, TSC2, RPTOR, WDR24 and ATG1/ULK1: in response to nutrient limitation, negatively regulates the mTORC1 complex by phosphorylating RPTOR component of the mTORC1 complex and by phosphorylating and activating TSC2 (PubMed:14651849, PubMed:18439900, PubMed:20160076, PubMed:21205641). Also phosphorylates and inhibits GATOR2 subunit WDR24 in response to nutrient limitation, leading to suppress glucose-mediated mTORC1 activation (PubMed:36732624). In response to energetic stress, phosphorylates FNIP1, inactivating the non-canonical mTORC1 signaling, thereby promoting nuclear translocation of TFEB and TFE3, and inducing transcription of lysosomal or autophagy genes (PubMed:37079666). In response to nutrient limitation, promotes autophagy by phosphorylating and activating ATG1/ULK1 (PubMed:21205641). In that process, it also activates WDR45/WIPI4 (PubMed:28561066). Phosphorylates CASP6, thereby preventing its autoprocessing and subsequent activation (PubMed:32029622). In response to nutrient limitation, phosphorylates transcription factor FOXO3 promoting FOXO3 mitochondrial import (By similarity). Also acts as a regulator of cellular polarity by remodeling the actin cytoskeleton; probably by indirectly activating myosin (PubMed:17486097). AMPK also acts as a regulator of circadian rhythm by mediating phosphorylation of CRY1, leading to destabilize it (By similarity). May regulate the Wnt signaling pathway by phosphorylating CTNNB1, leading to stabilize it (By similarity). Also has tau-protein kinase activity: in response to amyloid beta A4 protein (APP) exposure, activated by CAMKK2, leading to phosphorylation of MAPT/TAU; however the relevance of such data remains unclear in vivo (By similarity). Also phosphorylates CFTR, EEF2K, KLC1, NOS3 and SLC12A1 (PubMed:12519745, PubMed:20074060). Regulates hepatic lipogenesis. Activated via SIRT3, represses sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) transcriptional activities and ATP-consuming lipogenesis to restore cellular energy balance. Upon stress, regulates mitochondrial fragmentation through phosphorylation of MTFR1L (PubMed:36367943)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nAMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit alpha‑1 (PRKAA1, also known as AMPK1) belongs to the highly conserved family of AMP‐activated protein kinases that are present in all eukaryotes. This protein is evolutionarily related to yeast SNF1 and plant SnRK1, indicating that the kinase originated prior to the divergence of yeast, plants, and animals (sanz2008ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 1-5). In mammals, two distinct catalytic isoforms—alpha‑1 and alpha‑2—are expressed, with the alpha‑1 isoform being ubiquitously expressed and maintaining a central role in cellular energy homeostasis (hardie2012ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 1-2). The conservation of domain architecture across species, as well as the presence of orthologous regulatory subunits, places AMPK within an evolutionarily ancient core of energy‐sensing kinases that are traceable back to the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (arad2007ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 1-3, sanz2008ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 14-17). In the wider kinome, AMPK alpha‑1 shares structural and mechanistic features with other serine/threonine kinases and is grouped with kinases that are tightly regulated by adenine nucleotide binding and phosphorylation events (kurumbail2016structureandregulation pages 1-4).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nAMPK alpha‑1 catalyzes the phosphorylation of serine or threonine residues on target proteins using ATP as a phosphate donor. The general reaction can be written as:  \n  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (sanz2008ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 5-8, arad2007ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 1-3).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nCatalytic activity of AMPK alpha‑1 requires divalent metal ions for its kinase function. Specifically, Mg²⁺ is essential for ATP binding and proper enzymatic activity, serving as a cofactor in the phosphoryl transfer reaction (hardie2012ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 1-2, sanz2008ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 5-8).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nAMPK alpha‑1 phosphorylates a broad range of substrates that are central to cellular metabolic control. Its direct substrates include key metabolic enzymes such as acetyl‐CoA carboxylase (ACACA and ACACB), hormone‑sensitive lipase (LIPE), and regulatory proteins involved in insulin signalling and autophagy (arad2007ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 1-3, sanz2008ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 14-17). Although a precise consensus sequence for phosphorylation is not detailed in the provided context, the enzyme typically targets serine/threonine residues in regulatory regions of metabolic proteins, thereby modulating their activity in response to cellular energy status (li2019ampkandautophagy pages 97-100).\n\n5. Structure  \nThe catalytic subunit alpha‑1 of AMPK is approximately 63 kDa and is composed of multiple distinct regions that together form the structural basis for its kinase activity and regulation. The N‑terminal region contains a classical serine/threonine kinase domain that is organized into a small N‑lobe and a larger C‑lobe, a configuration typical of protein kinases (sanz2008ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 1-5). Within this domain lies the activation loop, which includes a critical threonine residue (Thr172 in AMPK‑α2; Thr174 in AMPK‑α1) whose phosphorylation increases kinase activity by more than 100-fold (hardie2011ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 2-3, saiу2010structuralandfunctional pages 11-16). Directly following the kinase domain is an autoinhibitory domain (AID) that serves to restrain enzymatic activity in the absence of allosteric activators (kurumbail2016structureandregulation pages 4-6). Adjacent to the AID, a flexible linker region containing regulatory interacting motifs (α-RIM1 and α-RIM2) connects the catalytic core to the C‑terminal region, which participates in interactions with the regulatory beta and gamma subunits (kurumbail2016structureandregulation pages 15-17, kurumbail2016structureandregulation pages 17-19). This C‑terminal domain also contains nuclear export sequences and a serine/threonine-rich loop, which is subject to additional post‑translational modifications. Structural studies have revealed that the kinase domain possesses key catalytic features such as a well‑defined ATP binding cleft, a correctly oriented C-helix, and a hydrophobic spine that are essential for substrate phosphorylation (saiу2010structuralandfunctional pages 16-21, sanz2008ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 40-46). The overall three-dimensional structure, as elucidated by crystallographic studies and supported by AlphaFold predictions, shows an elongated arrangement that allows dynamic interactions between the subunits of the AMPK heterotrimer (kurumbail2016structureandregulation pages 12-15).\n\n6. Regulation  \nRegulation of AMPK alpha‑1 is achieved through multiple layers of control including allosteric activation, phosphorylation, and post‑translational modifications. A key regulatory mechanism is the phosphorylation of the activation loop threonine (Thr174 in AMPK‑α1), which is performed by upstream kinases such as LKB1, Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase‑β (CaMKKβ), and under certain conditions by TAK1 (arad2007ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 3-4, li2019ampkandautophagy pages 97-100, salt2017ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 1-2). Binding of AMP (and to a lesser extent ADP) to the gamma subunit allosterically promotes this phosphorylation and simultaneously protects the phosphorylated threonine from dephosphorylation by phosphatases, including PP2A and PP2C (hardie2011ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 2-3, russell2020ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 23-24). In addition to phosphorylation, AMPK alpha‑1 is subject to various post‑translational modifications that modulate its activity. These include ubiquitination events that can mark the protein for proteasomal degradation, as well as additional phosphorylation events within the serine/threonine‑rich (ST) loop that can negatively regulate activation by interfering with LKB1-mediated phosphorylation (ovens2021posttranslationalmodificationsof pages 5-6, ovens2021posttranslationalmodificationsof pages 12-14). The autoinhibitory domain (AID) of AMPK alpha‑1 also plays a significant role in maintaining the enzyme in an inactive conformation until appropriate allosteric signals relieve the inhibition (kurumbail2016structureandregulation pages 4-6, salt2017ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 2-3). This multi‑layered regulatory network ensures that AMPK is activated only under conditions of energetic stress, thereby coordinating downstream metabolic responses (tarasiuk2022ampkanddiseases pages 1-3, hardie2011ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 3-4).\n\n7. Function  \nAMPK alpha‑1 functions as the catalytic core of the heterotrimeric AMPK complex and is a central regulator of cellular energy homeostasis. In response to a reduction in intracellular ATP levels and a concomitant increase in AMP or ADP, AMPK alpha‑1 is activated via phosphorylation and allosteric mechanisms, leading to the stimulation of catabolic pathways that generate ATP while inhibiting anabolic pathways that consume ATP (arad2007ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 1-3, wang2012ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 1-2). Its substrates include metabolic enzymes such as acetyl‑CoA carboxylase (regulating fatty acid synthesis and oxidation), hormone‑sensitive lipase (involved in lipid mobilization), and various proteins that modulate glucose uptake via the translocation of GLUT4 in muscle tissues (sanz2008ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 14-17, tarasiuk2022ampkanddiseases pages 5-6). AMPK alpha‑1 also phosphorylates transcriptional regulators—including FOXO3, p53, and TORC2—to affect gene expression programs related to mitochondrial biogenesis, autophagy, and cell cycle control (sanz2008ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 5-8, li2019ampkandautophagy pages 97-100). In the liver, it plays a critical role in regulating glucose homeostasis by controlling pathways that balance gluconeogenesis and glycolysis. Moreover, AMPK alpha‑1 is implicated in the regulation of cell growth and proliferation through its inhibitory effects on the mTORC1 complex via phosphorylation of RPTOR and activation of TSC2 (arad2007ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 4-5, tarasiuk2022ampkanddiseases pages 3-5). The enzyme is expressed widely across tissues, including in cardiac, skeletal muscle, liver, brain, and pancreatic cells, and contributes to adaptive responses during stress, such as ischemia, exercise, and nutrient deprivation (steinberg2009ampkinhealth pages 1-2, russell2020ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 23-24).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral small molecules and pharmacological compounds have been developed to modulate AMPK activity, with some designed to specifically activate AMPK via the allosteric drug and metabolite (ADaM) site located at the interface between the alpha and beta subunits (kurumbail2016structureandregulation pages 6-9, smiles2024themetabolicsensor pages 2-3). Agents such as metformin and salicylate are known to indirectly activate AMPK and are under investigation for their potential in treating metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes and non‑alcoholic fatty liver disease (wang2012ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 1-2, tarasiuk2022ampkanddiseases pages 5-6). Disease associations for AMPK alpha‑1 include its involvement in cancer, where alterations in upstream kinases like LKB1 and downstream effects on mTOR signaling have been noted, as well as in cardiac hypertrophy and neurodegenerative conditions where energy imbalance is a key factor (steinberg2009ampkinhealth pages 7-8, russell2020ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 4-6). Furthermore, aberrant post‑translational modifications such as increased ubiquitination or mis‑regulation of inhibitory phosphorylations have been linked to metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance (ovens2021posttranslationalmodificationsof pages 7-9, ovens2021posttranslationalmodificationsof pages 9-10). The kinase also exhibits tau‑protein kinase activity, with potential implications in tau pathology although the in vivo relevance of this activity remains to be fully established (arad2007ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 4-5). These additional layers of regulation and their disease associations underscore the clinical significance of AMPK alpha‑1 as a therapeutic target (smiles2024themetabolicsensor pages 26-27).\n\n9.

MAPK11 is one of the four p38 MAPKs which play an important role in the cascades of cellular responses evoked by extracellular stimuli such as pro-inflammatory cytokines or physical stress leading to direct activation of transcription factors (PubMed:12452429, PubMed:20626350, PubMed:35857590). Accordingly, p38 MAPKs phosphorylate a broad range of proteins and it has been estimated that they may have approximately 200 to 300 substrates each (PubMed:12452429, PubMed:20626350, PubMed:35857590). MAPK11 functions are mostly redundant with those of MAPK14 (PubMed:12452429, PubMed:20626350, PubMed:35857590). Some of the targets are downstream kinases which are activated through phosphorylation and further phosphorylate additional targets (PubMed:12452429, PubMed:20626350). RPS6KA5/MSK1 and RPS6KA4/MSK2 can directly phosphorylate and activate transcription factors such as CREB1, ATF1, the NF-kappa-B isoform RELA/NFKB3, STAT1 and STAT3, but can also phosphorylate histone H3 and the nucleosomal protein HMGN1 (PubMed:9687510). RPS6KA5/MSK1 and RPS6KA4/MSK2 play important roles in the rapid induction of immediate-early genes in response to stress or mitogenic stimuli, either by inducing chromatin remodeling or by recruiting the transcription machinery. On the other hand, two other kinase targets, MAPKAPK2/MK2 and MAPKAPK3/MK3, participate in the control of gene expression mostly at the post-transcriptional level, by phosphorylating ZFP36 (tristetraprolin) and ELAVL1, and by regulating EEF2K, which is important for the elongation of mRNA during translation. MKNK1/MNK1 and MKNK2/MNK2, two other kinases activated by p38 MAPKs, regulate protein synthesis by phosphorylating the initiation factor EIF4E2 (PubMed:11154262). In the cytoplasm, the p38 MAPK pathway is an important regulator of protein turnover. For example, CFLAR is an inhibitor of TNF-induced apoptosis whose proteasome-mediated degradation is regulated by p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Ectodomain shedding of transmembrane proteins is regulated by p38 MAPKs as well. In response to inflammatory stimuli, p38 MAPKs phosphorylate the membrane-associated metalloprotease ADAM17. Such phosphorylation is required for ADAM17-mediated ectodomain shedding of TGF-alpha family ligands, which results in the activation of EGFR signaling and cell proliferation. Additional examples of p38 MAPK substrates are the FGFR1. FGFR1 can be translocated from the extracellular space into the cytosol and nucleus of target cells, and regulates processes such as rRNA synthesis and cell growth. FGFR1 translocation requires p38 MAPK activation. In the nucleus, many transcription factors are phosphorylated and activated by p38 MAPKs in response to different stimuli. Classical examples include ATF1, ATF2, ATF6, ELK1, PTPRH, DDIT3, TP53/p53 and MEF2C and MEF2A (PubMed:10330143, PubMed:15356147, PubMed:9430721). The p38 MAPKs are emerging as important modulators of gene expression by regulating chromatin modifiers and remodelers (PubMed:10330143, PubMed:15356147, PubMed:9430721). The promoters of several genes involved in the inflammatory response, such as IL6, IL8 and IL12B, display a p38 MAPK-dependent enrichment of histone H3 phosphorylation on 'Ser-10' (H3S10ph) in LPS-stimulated myeloid cells. This phosphorylation enhances the accessibility of the cryptic NF-kappa-B-binding sites marking promoters for increased NF-kappa-B recruitment. Phosphorylates NLRP1 downstream of MAP3K20/ZAK in response to UV-B irradiation and ribosome collisions, promoting activation of the NLRP1 inflammasome and pyroptosis (PubMed:35857590). Phosphorylates methyltransferase DOT1L on 'Ser-834', 'Thr-900', 'Ser-902', 'Thr-984', 'Ser-1001', 'Ser-1009' and 'Ser-1104' (PubMed:38270553)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nMAPK11, also known as p38 β, is an evolutionarily conserved member of the p38 MAPK subfamily within the overall human kinome. It is ubiquitously expressed across vertebrates and is consistently found alongside its close paralog MAPK14 (p38 α) as well as the more divergent p38 γ and p38 δ isoforms. Gene duplication events have resulted in a clear phylogenetic split within the p38 MAPK group, with MAPK11 clustering tightly with MAPK14, thus underscoring a common evolutionary origin with preservation across multiple species (li2011evolutionaryhistoryof pages 1-2, escos2016p38γandp38δ pages 1-2, roux2004erkandp38 pages 2-3). Moreover, comparative phylogenetic analyses across vertebrates indicate that MAPK11 appears within a conserved gene cluster attributable to segmental duplications, a pattern that reinforces its placement in an evolutionary core set of stress-responsive kinases (li2011evolutionaryhistoryof pages 4-5, roux2004erkandp38 pages 2-3).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nMAPK11 catalyzes a phosphorylation reaction in which the γ-phosphate group from ATP is transferred to specific serine or threonine residues on target proteins. This chemical reaction can be summarized as: ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 4-5, roux2004erkandp38 pages 18-19, shi2002inthecellular pages 12-13).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe kinase activity of MAPK11 is strictly dependent on the presence of ATP, whose phosphate group is directly transferred during catalysis. In addition, divalent metal ions, typically Mg²⁺, are required as cofactors to coordinate ATP binding at the catalytic site, ensuring proper orientation and efficient phosphoryl transfer (machado2021thep38mapk pages 1-2, shi2002inthecellular pages 12-13).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nMAPK11 exhibits substrate specificity characteristic of serine/threonine kinases by preferentially phosphorylating Ser/Thr residues that are often immediately followed by a proline residue. This Ser/Thr-Pro consensus motif facilitates the selective phosphorylation of a broad range of substrates that include key transcription factors and regulatory enzymes. The extensive substrate repertoire—estimated to number from 200 to 300 distinct proteins—reflects the enzyme’s relatively relaxed amino acid preference in substrate motifs, thereby enabling its participation in multiple facets of stress and inflammatory responses (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 4-5, burton2021atypicalp38signaling pages 17-18, shi2002inthecellular pages 1-2).\n\n5. Structure  \nThe three-dimensional structure of MAPK11 is defined by a central, highly conserved catalytic kinase domain that is organized into two lobes. The smaller N-terminal lobe is predominantly composed of beta-sheets, while the larger C-terminal lobe is composed of alpha-helices, forming the typical bilobal architecture observed in protein kinases. A critical structural element is the activation loop, which harbors the conserved Thr-Gly-Tyr (TGY) dual-phosphorylation motif; phosphorylation of both threonine and tyrosine residues within this loop induces a conformational change that renders the kinase active. In addition, MAPK11 contains a docking domain—characterized by sequence features such as the DPED motif—that ensures efficient binding to upstream kinases (MKK3/MKK6) and downstream substrates. Structural features such as the ATP-binding cleft, adjacent hydrophobic pockets, and the regulatory C-helix are essential for catalytic function and inhibitor binding, as exemplified by crystallographic studies of related p38 isoforms (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 4-5, roux2004erkandp38 pages 3-4, shi2002inthecellular pages 1-2).\n\n6. Regulation  \nThe regulatory mechanisms controlling MAPK11 activity center on its activation by upstream dual-specificity kinases, primarily MKK3 and MKK6, which phosphorylate the TGY motif within the activation loop. Dual phosphorylation at this motif is necessary to induce the conformational rearrangement that facilitates substrate binding and kinase activity. Inactivation is mediated by specific MAP kinase phosphatases (MKPs) that remove these phosphate groups, thereby returning MAPK11 to an inactive state. Additional layers of regulation include interactions with scaffold proteins and adaptor molecules that dictate subcellular localization and temporal activation, as well as allosteric regulation via inhibitor binding at the ATP site (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 4-5, burton2021atypicalp38signaling pages 2-4, shi2002inthecellular pages 1-2).\n\n7. Function  \nMAPK11 functions as a key serine/threonine kinase in the cellular stress response signaling cascade. It is activated in response to environmental stressors and pro-inflammatory cytokines, subsequently phosphorylating a wide array of substrates that include transcription factors, other kinases, and proteins involved in mRNA processing and protein turnover. Downstream targets of the p38 MAPK pathway, such as MAPKAPK2/MK2, MAPKAPK3/MK3, and kinases like MNK1/MNK2, propagate signals that ultimately regulate gene expression via transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. In the nucleus, activation of key transcription factors—including ATF1, ATF2, p53, and members of the NF-κB family—facilitates immediate-early gene induction in response to stress, while cytoplasmic substrates involved in mRNA stability and protein degradation further underscore the broad biological impact of MAPK11 signaling. Moreover, MAPK11 plays a role in ectodomain shedding through the regulation of metalloproteases, amplifying its involvement in inflammatory cascades. Although its functions largely overlap with those of MAPK14, the specialized tissue expression of MAPK11 further contributes to the fine-tuning of stress-activated responses (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 4-5, burton2021atypicalp38signaling pages 2-4, shi2002inthecellular pages 1-2, koul2013roleofp38 pages 2-4).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nMAPK11 is subject to pharmacological inhibition by compounds that target the conserved ATP-binding pocket; inhibitors such as SB203580 and SB202190 have been demonstrated to interfere with both MAPK11 and MAPK14 activity, thereby highlighting the functional redundancy of these isoforms. Its involvement in stress and inflammatory signaling has been correlated with various disease states, and ongoing research continues to evaluate the therapeutic potential of targeting p38 MAPK isoforms in inflammatory disorders and other pathological conditions. Additionally, its extensive substrate range, including downstream kinases and transcription regulators, positions MAPK11 as a pivotal mediator in both cytoplasmic and nuclear signaling events (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 4-5, burton2021atypicalp38signaling pages 2-4, machado2021thep38mapk pages 1-2).\n\n9.

    "answer": "Question: # Information\n\n**Protein Name: Mitogen-activated protein kinase 12 / gene: MAPK12 ERK6; SAPK3**\n**Uniprot Id: P53778**\n**Protein alternative names: Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 6; Mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 gamma; Stress-activated protein kinase 3**\n**Protein Function: Serine/threonine kinase which acts as an essential component of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. MAPK12 is one of the four p38 MAPKs which play an important role in the cascades of cellular responses evoked by extracellular stimuli such as pro-inflammatory cytokines or physical stress leading to direct activation of transcription factors such as ELK1 and ATF2. Accordingly, p38 MAPKs phosphorylate a broad range of proteins and it has been estimated that they may have approximately 200 to 300 substrates each. Some of the targets are downstream kinases such as MAPKAPK2, which are activated through phosphorylation and further phosphorylate additional targets. Plays a role in myoblast differentiation and also in the down-regulation of cyclin D1 in response to hypoxia in adrenal cells suggesting MAPK12 may inhibit cell proliferation while promoting differentiation. Phosphorylates DLG1. Following osmotic shock, MAPK12 in the cell nucleus increases its association with nuclear DLG1, thereby causing dissociation of DLG1-SFPQ complexes. This function is independent of its catalytic activity and could affect mRNA processing and/or gene transcription to aid cell adaptation to osmolarity changes in the environment. Regulates UV-induced checkpoint signaling and repair of UV-induced DNA damage and G2 arrest after gamma-radiation exposure. MAPK12 is involved in the regulation of SLC2A1 expression and basal glucose uptake in L6 myotubes; and negatively regulates SLC2A4 expression and contraction-mediated glucose uptake in adult skeletal muscle. C-Jun (JUN) phosphorylation is stimulated by MAPK14 and inhibited by MAPK12, leading to a distinct AP-1 regulation. MAPK12 is required for the normal kinetochore localization of PLK1, prevents chromosomal instability and supports mitotic cell viability. MAPK12-signaling is also positively regulating the expansion of transient amplifying myogenic precursor cells during muscle growth and regeneration**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nMAPK12, which is also known as ERK6, SAPK3, or p38 gamma, is classified within the p38 mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) subfamily of stress‐activated protein kinases (SAPKs) that also include p38 alpha, p38 beta, and p38 delta isoforms (arbabi2002mitogenactivatedproteinkinases pages 1-2, cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 4-5). MAPK12 is evolutionarily conserved across vertebrates with orthologs identified in species such as human, mouse, and rat, where its expression patterns and roles in stress signaling are maintained (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 1-1, kultz1998phylogeneticandfunctional pages 17-18). Within the kinome, MAPK12 is grouped in the p38 branch, which is distinct from the classical extracellular signal‐regulated kinases (ERKs) and the c‐Jun N‐terminal kinases (JNKs), in accordance with phylogenetic analyses that trace the origins of MAPK signaling modules from early eukaryotic lineages (kyriakis1996proteinkinasecascades pages 1-3, kultz1998phylogeneticandfunctional pages 2-3). Based on the comprehensive classification of kinases described in foundational publications (Manning et al.), MAPK12 occupies a central position in the stress response network and is part of an evolutionarily conserved cascade that spans from yeast to mammals (goedert1997activationofthe pages 1-2).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nMAPK12 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to specific serine/threonine residues on target proteins. The generic reaction can be represented as follows: ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (johnson2002mitogenactivatedproteinkinase pages 1-2, arbabi2002mitogenactivatedproteinkinases pages 1-2).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of MAPK12 requires divalent cations, with Mg²⁺ being indispensable for the optimal binding of ATP and subsequent phosphoryl transfer to substrates. This cofactor requirement is similar to other serine/threonine kinases in the MAPK family (cuschieri2005mitogenactivatedproteinkinase pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nMAPK12 is a proline‐directed serine/threonine kinase that generally phosphorylates substrates with serine or threonine residues immediately followed by a proline residue, forming part of a consensus motif typically represented as [S/T]P (enslen1998selectiveactivationof pages 1-2, tibbles1999thestressactivatedprotein pages 1-3). In cellular contexts, MAPK12 phosphorylates a broad range of substrates, including transcription factors such as ATF2 and ELK1, as well as other downstream kinases like MAPKAPK2 that contribute to signal propagation (arbabi2002mitogenactivatedproteinkinases pages 1-2, cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 1-2). Additionally, studies have estimated that p38 MAPKs, including MAPK12, may have up to 200–300 substrates, indicating a broad specificity likely governed by docking interactions and unique amino acid residues in the kinase’s substrate binding pocket (goedert1997activationofthe pages 1-2, sugden1998“stressresponsive”mitogenactivatedproteinkinase pages 1-2).\n\n5. Structure  \nMAPK12, like other MAPK family members, has a central kinase domain of approximately 300–370 amino acids that is flanked by variable N-terminal and C-terminal regions. The catalytic domain typically comprises an N-terminal lobe that binds ATP and a larger C-terminal lobe that accommodates substrate binding (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 4-5, kultz1998phylogeneticandfunctional pages 3-4). Characteristic of MAPKs, MAPK12 possesses a highly conserved dual phosphorylation motif—commonly a Thr-Gly-Tyr (TGY) motif—located in the activation loop; dual phosphorylation at the threonine and tyrosine residues is essential for catalytic activation (arbabi2002mitogenactivatedproteinkinases pages 1-2, cuenda1997activationofstressactivated pages 1-2). Structural analyses reveal that unique amino acid residues surrounding the ATP binding pocket account for differential inhibitor sensitivity; for example, the pyridinyl imidazole inhibitors such as SB203580–which potently inhibit p38 alpha, beta, and delta–do not effectively inhibit MAPK12 due to differences in residues lining the binding site (kyriakis2001mammalianmitogenactivatedprotein pages 6-7, cuenda1997activationofstressactivated pages 6-7). In addition, MAPK12 contains typical MAPK domains that include a glycine-rich loop for ATP binding, a catalytic loop, and regulatory regions that modulate substrate interactions via docking domains—such as D domains and DEF domains—which help specify its interaction with substrates and regulators (roux2004erkandp38 pages 1-1, kultz1998phylogeneticandfunctional pages 4-5). Although high-resolution crystal structures specific to MAPK12 are uncommon, homology models based on related p38 kinases indicate that the overall 3D fold comprises an N-terminal beta-sheet region and a C-terminal alpha-helical domain that form a cleft for ATP binding and substrate accommodation (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 5-6).\n\n6. Regulation  \nMAPK12 is activated through a classical three-tier MAPK cascade wherein upstream dual-specificity MAPK kinases (MKKs), particularly MKK6 and, to a lesser extent, MKK3, catalyze the dual phosphorylation of its activation loop at the TGY motif (arbabi2002mitogenactivatedproteinkinases pages 1-2, cuenda1997activationofstressactivated pages 1-2). The phosphorylation event is catalyzed by MKK6, which is the principal upstream activator for all p38 MAPK isoforms, leading to a conformational change that stabilizes the active state of MAPK12 (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 1-2, sugden1998“stressresponsive”mitogenactivatedproteinkinase pages 1-2). Post-translational modifications, notably phosphorylation, are the primary regulatory mechanism for MAPK12 activity and affect substrate access and catalytic efficiency (cuenda1997activationofstressactivated pages 10-11). In addition, certain cellular stress conditions such as osmotic shock promote a non-catalytic regulatory function of MAPK12; following osmotic stress, MAPK12 increases its association with the nuclear protein DLG1, thereby modulating DLG1-SFPQ complex dynamics in a manner that is independent of its kinase activity (arbabi2002mitogenactivatedproteinkinases pages 1-2). MAPK12 regulation also features involvement in checkpoint signaling, as it modulates signaling pathways involved in UV-induced DNA damage repair and G2 cell cycle arrest after gamma-radiation exposure (kyriakis2001mammalianmitogenactivatedprotein pages 4-6, tibbles1999thestressactivatedprotein pages 1-3). Moreover, MAPK12 influences the phosphorylation state of other transcription factors; for example, it has been shown to reduce c-Jun phosphorylation, thereby altering AP-1 complex regulation (kyriakis2001mammalianmitogenactivatedprotein pages 6-7). Alternative pathways, including association with specific scaffold proteins and phosphatases (such as MAPK phosphatases which dephosphorylate MAPKs), contribute to fine-tuning MAPK12 activity during dynamic cellular responses (cuenda1997activationofstressactivated pages 6-7, kyriakis2001mammalianmitogenactivatedprotein pages 13-15).\n\n7. Function  \nMAPK12 plays an integral role in cellular responses to extracellular stimuli such as pro-inflammatory cytokines and various physical stresses. In several cell types, activation of MAPK12 leads to the direct phosphorylation of transcription factors including ELK1 and ATF2, events that are crucial for initiating gene expression programs during stress and differentiation (arbabi2002mitogenactivatedproteinkinases pages 1-2, cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 1-1). In myoblasts, MAPK12 is essential for normal muscle differentiation, contributing to both the expansion of transient amplifying myogenic precursor cells and subsequent muscle regeneration processes (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 1-2, tibbles1999thestressactivatedprotein pages 1-3). In addition, in adrenal cells, MAPK12 phosphorylates substrates that lead to the down-regulation of cyclin D1 under hypoxic conditions, thereby linking its activity to inhibition of cell proliferation while promoting differentiation (arbabi2002mitogenactivatedproteinkinases pages 1-2, kyriakis2001mammalianmitogenactivatedprotein pages 4-6). MAPK12 is also implicated in regulating cellular responses to osmotic shock; by translocating to the nucleus and associating with DLG1, MAPK12 disrupts DLG1-SFPQ complexes, potentially affecting mRNA processing and gene transcription critical for cellular adaptation to environmental osmolarity changes (arbabi2002mitogenactivatedproteinkinases pages 1-2, tibbles1999thestressactivatedprotein pages 1-3). Furthermore, MAPK12 contributes to checkpoint signal transduction: it regulates the repair of UV-induced DNA lesions and is required for the normal kinetochore localization of the mitotic kinase PLK1, thereby preventing chromosomal instability and supporting mitotic cell viability (arbabi2002mitogenactivatedproteinkinases pages 1-2, kyriakis2001mammalianmitogenactivatedprotein pages 6-7). In the context of metabolic regulation in muscle, MAPK12 modulates the expression of SLC2A1 and SLC2A4, affecting basal and contraction-mediated glucose uptake in muscle cells (arbabi2002mitogenactivatedproteinkinases pages 1-2, tibbles1999thestressactivatedprotein pages 1-3). Finally, MAPK12 exerts differential regulation on the AP-1 transcription factor complex by stimulating MAPK14-mediated signals while concurrently inhibiting c-Jun phosphorylation, thereby contributing to a distinct transcriptional output during inflammatory and stress responses (arbabi2002mitogenactivatedproteinkinases pages 1-2, kyriakis2001mammalianmitogenactivatedprotein pages 6-7).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nPharmacological studies indicate that inhibitors such as the pyridinyl imidazole compounds (e.g., SB203580) effectively inhibit the kinase activity of p38 alpha, beta, and delta isoforms but not MAPK12 due to differences in the ATP-binding pocket (cuenda1997activationofstressactivated pages 6-7, kyriakis2001mammalianmitogenactivatedprotein pages 6-7). This distinct inhibitor sensitivity makes MAPK12 a potential target for the development of selective modulators that may differentiate its signaling roles from other p38 members (roux2004erkandp38 pages 1-1, sugden1998“stressresponsive”mitogenactivatedproteinkinase pages 1-2). In terms of disease associations, aberrant MAPK12 signaling has been linked to inflammatory processes, dysregulated cell proliferation, and defects in DNA damage repair mechanisms that may contribute to cancer and other stress-related pathologies (arbabi2002mitogenactivatedproteinkinases pages 1-2, kyriakis2001mammalianmitogenactivatedprotein pages 19-20). Additionally, MAPK12’s regulatory influence on glucose transporter expression in skeletal muscle suggests potential implications in metabolic disorders (arbabi2002mitogenactivatedproteinkinases pages 1-2, tibbles1999thestressactivatedprotein pages 1-3). No specific disease mutations are detailed in the context provided; however, the breadth of MAPK12’s influence on cell cycle control, transcriptional regulation, and stress responses underscores its significance as a potential therapeutic target in a variety of diseases (arbabi2002mitogenactivatedproteinkinases pages 1-2, cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 1-2).\n\n9.

MAPK13 is one of the four p38 MAPKs which play an important role in the cascades of cellular responses evoked by extracellular stimuli such as pro-inflammatory cytokines or physical stress leading to direct activation of transcription factors such as ELK1 and ATF2. Accordingly, p38 MAPKs phosphorylate a broad range of proteins and it has been estimated that they may have approximately 200 to 300 substrates each. MAPK13 is one of the less studied p38 MAPK isoforms. Some of the targets are downstream kinases such as MAPKAPK2, which are activated through phosphorylation and further phosphorylate additional targets. Plays a role in the regulation of protein translation by phosphorylating and inactivating EEF2K. Involved in cytoskeletal remodeling through phosphorylation of MAPT and STMN1. Mediates UV irradiation induced up-regulation of the gene expression of CXCL14. Plays an important role in the regulation of epidermal keratinocyte differentiation, apoptosis and skin tumor development. Phosphorylates the transcriptional activator MYB in response to stress which leads to rapid MYB degradation via a proteasome-dependent pathway. MAPK13 also phosphorylates and down-regulates PRKD1 during regulation of insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny**  \nMitogen‐activated protein kinase 13 (MAPK13), also known as p38 delta or SAPK4, belongs to the p38 MAPK subfamily, which comprises four isoforms: p38α (MAPK14), p38β (MAPK11), p38γ (MAPK12), and p38δ (MAPK13) (cerezoguisado2011mapk13(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2). Phylogenetically, the p38 MAPKs are a distinct branch within the kinome that evolved in early eukaryotes and are conserved across mammalian species (arbabi2002mitogenactivatedproteinkinases pages 1-2). MAPK13 is thought to share approximately 60% overall amino acid identity with the more widely studied p38α and p38β isoforms while being more divergent from the p38γ isoform (cerezoguisado2011mapk13(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2, bachstetter2010thep38map pages 1-3). Evolutionary analyses based on the protein kinase complement indicate that MAPK13 and its p38 relatives form a conserved set of signaling kinases that trace back to a common eukaryotic ancestor, thus representing a core component of cellular stress response mechanisms (kyriakis2001mammalianmitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2, pearson2001mitogenactivatedprotein(map) pages 1-2). The conservation of the central kinase domain, including the activation loop motif, underscores their functional significance in stress-activated signaling cascades.  \n\n**2. Reaction Catalyzed**  \nMAPK13 catalyzes the phosphorylation of serine/threonine residues in protein substrates during the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP. The chemical reaction can be summarized as follows: ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (johnson2002mitogenactivatedproteinkinase pages 1-2). This phosphorylation reaction is essential for modulating the activity, subcellular localization, and protein–protein interactions of many downstream targets.  \n\n**3. Cofactor Requirements**  \nThe catalytic activity of MAPK13 requires divalent metal ions, with Mg²⁺ serving as the primary cofactor. Mg²⁺ facilitates the proper binding of ATP in the kinase’s active site and is essential for the phosphate transfer reaction (zarubin2005activationandsignaling pages 5-6, roux2004erkandp38 pages 2-3).  \n\n**4. Substrate Specificity**  \nMAPK13 phosphorylates serine/threonine residues on a broad range of substrates, and its substrate repertoire is estimated to include between 200 and 300 proteins. Among its substrates are transcription factors such as ELK1 and ATF2, which are directly activated upon phosphorylation, thereby modulating gene expression in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines and physical stress (cerezoguisado2011mapk13(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2, pages 2-3). In addition, MAPK13 phosphorylates downstream kinases such as MAPKAPK2, which further propagate stress-signaling cascades (cerezoguisado2011mapk13(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 2-3). Other well-documented substrates include proteins involved in the regulation of protein translation, such as the eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (EEF2K), as well as cytoskeletal regulatory proteins including MAPT (tau) and STMN1 (stathmin) (cerezoguisado2011mapk13(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2, arbabi2002mitogenactivatedproteinkinases pages 4-4). Although a precise consensus phosphorylation motif for MAPK13 has not been exhaustively established in the literature provided, its substrate preference appears to align with motifs commonly recognized by p38 MAPK isoforms.  \n\n**5. Structure**  \nMAPK13 is a serine/threonine kinase comprised of 365 amino acids with an approximate molecular weight of 40 kDa (cerezoguisado2011mapk13(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2). Its central kinase domain adopts the canonical bilobal structure characteristic of the eukaryotic protein kinase superfamily, with a smaller N-terminal lobe that predominantly binds ATP and a larger C-terminal lobe that provides the substrate-binding site (tibbles1999thestressactivatedprotein pages 1-3). A key structural feature is the conserved activation loop containing the Thr-Gly-Tyr (TGY) motif; dual phosphorylation at Thr180 and Tyr182 within this motif is required for full activation of MAPK13 (cerezoguisado2011mapk13(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2, zarubin2005activationandsignaling pages 3-5). The presence of this dual phosphorylation site permits conformational changes that align the catalytic residues for efficient phosphate transfer. Furthermore, the C-helix within the N-terminal lobe contributes to the formation of the hydrophobic spine that is critical for kinase activity, and additional docking domains facilitate interactions with upstream MAP kinase kinases (MKK3 and MKK6) as well as with specific substrates and regulatory proteins (roux2004erkandp38 pages 3-4, pearson2001mitogenactivatedprotein(map) pages 2-3). No unique structural domains beyond the conserved kinase core have been reported for MAPK13, but subtle variations in surface residues and the length of regions flanking the catalytic domain contribute to differences in substrate specificity and inhibitor sensitivity compared to other p38 isoforms (cerezoguisado2011mapk13(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 3-4, arbabi2002mitogenactivatedproteinkinases pages 4-4).  \n\n**6. Regulation**  \nMAPK13 is activated primarily by dual phosphorylation of its activation loop TGY motif, a reaction catalyzed by the upstream kinases MKK3 and MKK6. In certain cell types, MKK3 appears to preferentially activate MAPK13, while in other contexts MKK6 is the predominant activator (cerezoguisado2011mapk13(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2, zarubin2005activationandsignaling pages 2-3). This phosphorylation event induces a conformational change necessary for ATP binding and substrate access to the catalytic cleft. In addition, regulatory protein–protein interactions and possible feedback inhibition by downstream MAPK-activated protein kinases such as MAPKAPK2 modulate MAPK13 activity (cerezoguisado2011mapk13(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 2-3, dodeller2006thep38mitogenactivated pages 1-2). There is evidence that MAPK13 is differentially regulated compared to other p38 isoforms, partially due to differences in inhibitor sensitivity; for example, common pyridinyl imidazole inhibitors that effectively target p38α and p38β do not inhibit p38δ (MAPK13) efficiently, suggesting distinct regulatory conformations in the ATP-binding pocket (zarubin2005activationandsignaling pages 5-6, pearson2001mitogenactivatedprotein(map) pages 15-16). Dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases further contributes to its regulation, ensuring the transient nature of its activation following stress stimuli (kyriakis2001mammalianmitogenactivatedprotein pages 4-6).  \n\n**7. Function**  \nMAPK13 plays a multifaceted role in cellular stress response and signal transduction. It is widely expressed in various tissues such as the testes, pancreas, kidney, and small intestine and is localized in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (cerezoguisado2011mapk13(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2). Upon activation by environmental stresses or pro-inflammatory cytokines, MAPK13 phosphorylates a broad range of substrates, thereby modulating numerous physiological processes. These include:  \n\n• Transcriptional regulation: MAPK13 phosphorylates transcription factors such as ELK1 and ATF2, leading to the activation of genes that mediate inflammatory responses and cellular adaptation to stress (cerezoguisado2011mapk13(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2, pages 3-4).  \n\n• Protein translation control: By phosphorylating and inactivating the eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (EEF2K), MAPK13 indirectly regulates protein synthesis, thereby influencing cellular growth and metabolism (cerezoguisado2011mapk13(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2).  \n\n• Cytoskeletal remodeling: MAPK13 phosphorylates cytoskeletal-associated proteins such as MAPT (tau) and STMN1 (stathmin), which are involved in microtubule dynamics and cytoskeleton reorganization. These actions contribute to changes in cell shape, motility, and potentially cellular differentiation (cerezoguisado2011mapk13(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 1-2, arbabi2002mitogenactivatedproteinkinases pages 4-4).  \n\n• Keratinocyte differentiation and skin tumor development: In keratinocytes, MAPK13 regulates differentiation processes and modulates apoptosis. It has been implicated in the up-regulation of genes such as CXCL14 following UV irradiation, as well as in the phosphorylation of MYB, which leads to its rapid degradation via a proteasome-dependent pathway. Collectively, these activities have been linked to skin tumorigenesis (cerezoguisado2011mapk13(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 2-3, bachstetter2010thep38map pages 4-6).  \n\n• Regulation of insulin secretion: In pancreatic beta cells, MAPK13 phosphorylates and down-regulates PRKD1 (protein kinase D1), which plays an important role in insulin exocytosis. This function is critical for maintaining proper beta-cell survival and metabolic homeostasis (cerezoguisado2011mapk13(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 2-3).)  \n\nThese diverse roles establish MAPK13 as an essential component in the cellular responses elicited by various extracellular stimuli, contributing to processes that span inflammation, cytoskeletal reorganization, gene expression, and metabolic regulation (arbabi2002mitogenactivatedproteinkinases pages 1-2, zarubin2005activationandsignaling pages 3-5).  \n\n**8. Other Comments**  \nMAPK13 exhibits a distinct inhibitor sensitivity profile among the p38 MAPK isoforms. Commonly used pyridinyl imidazole compounds, such as SB203580, which potently inhibit p38α and p38β, fail to effectively inhibit MAPK13, underscoring its unique structural and regulatory features (zarubin2005activationandsignaling pages 5-6, pearson2001mitogenactivatedprotein(map) pages 15-16). Such differences have important implications for drug discovery and selective modulation of p38 MAPK signaling pathways in disease contexts. Dysregulation of MAPK13 has been associated with a variety of pathophysiological conditions, including inflammatory diseases, certain skin pathologies like psoriasis and skin tumorigenesis, and metabolic disorders related to impaired insulin secretion (cerezoguisado2011mapk13(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 2-3, bachstetter2010thep38map pages 4-6). Additionally, alterations in MAPK13 signaling have been noted in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, particularly through its effects on proteins such as tau (MAPT) and stathmin (STMN1) (cerezoguisado2011mapk13(mitogenactivatedprotein pages 2-3, dodeller2006thep38mitogenactivated pages 2-3). The understanding of these disease associations continues to evolve as further studies elucidate the isoform-specific roles and regulation of MAPK13 compared to its p38 MAPK counterparts.  \n\n**9.

MAPK14 is one of the four p38 MAPKs which play an important role in the cascades of cellular responses evoked by extracellular stimuli such as pro-inflammatory cytokines or physical stress leading to direct activation of transcription factors. Accordingly, p38 MAPKs phosphorylate a broad range of proteins and it has been estimated that they may have approximately 200 to 300 substrates each. Some of the targets are downstream kinases which are activated through phosphorylation and further phosphorylate additional targets. RPS6KA5/MSK1 and RPS6KA4/MSK2 can directly phosphorylate and activate transcription factors such as CREB1, ATF1, the NF-kappa-B isoform RELA/NFKB3, STAT1 and STAT3, but can also phosphorylate histone H3 and the nucleosomal protein HMGN1 (PubMed:9687510, PubMed:9792677). RPS6KA5/MSK1 and RPS6KA4/MSK2 play important roles in the rapid induction of immediate-early genes in response to stress or mitogenic stimuli, either by inducing chromatin remodeling or by recruiting the transcription machinery (PubMed:9687510, PubMed:9792677). On the other hand, two other kinase targets, MAPKAPK2/MK2 and MAPKAPK3/MK3, participate in the control of gene expression mostly at the post-transcriptional level, by phosphorylating ZFP36 (tristetraprolin) and ELAVL1, and by regulating EEF2K, which is important for the elongation of mRNA during translation. MKNK1/MNK1 and MKNK2/MNK2, two other kinases activated by p38 MAPKs, regulate protein synthesis by phosphorylating the initiation factor EIF4E2 (PubMed:11154262). MAPK14 also interacts with casein kinase II, leading to its activation through autophosphorylation and further phosphorylation of TP53/p53 (PubMed:10747897). In the cytoplasm, the p38 MAPK pathway is an important regulator of protein turnover. For example, CFLAR is an inhibitor of TNF-induced apoptosis whose proteasome-mediated degradation is regulated by p38 MAPK phosphorylation. In a similar way, MAPK14 phosphorylates the ubiquitin ligase SIAH2, regulating its activity towards EGLN3 (PubMed:17003045). MAPK14 may also inhibit the lysosomal degradation pathway of autophagy by interfering with the intracellular trafficking of the transmembrane protein ATG9 (PubMed:19893488). Another function of MAPK14 is to regulate the endocytosis of membrane receptors by different mechanisms that impinge on the small GTPase RAB5A. In addition, clathrin-mediated EGFR internalization induced by inflammatory cytokines and UV irradiation depends on MAPK14-mediated phosphorylation of EGFR itself as well as of RAB5A effectors (PubMed:16932740). Ectodomain shedding of transmembrane proteins is regulated by p38 MAPKs as well. In response to inflammatory stimuli, p38 MAPKs phosphorylate the membrane-associated metalloprotease ADAM17 (PubMed:20188673). Such phosphorylation is required for ADAM17-mediated ectodomain shedding of TGF-alpha family ligands, which results in the activation of EGFR signaling and cell proliferation. Another p38 MAPK substrate is FGFR1. FGFR1 can be translocated from the extracellular space into the cytosol and nucleus of target cells, and regulates processes such as rRNA synthesis and cell growth. FGFR1 translocation requires p38 MAPK activation. In the nucleus, many transcription factors are phosphorylated and activated by p38 MAPKs in response to different stimuli. Classical examples include ATF1, ATF2, ATF6, ELK1, PTPRH, DDIT3, TP53/p53 and MEF2C and MEF2A (PubMed:10330143, PubMed:9430721, PubMed:9858528). The p38 MAPKs are emerging as important modulators of gene expression by regulating chromatin modifiers and remodelers. The promoters of several genes involved in the inflammatory response, such as IL6, IL8 and IL12B, display a p38 MAPK-dependent enrichment of histone H3 phosphorylation on 'Ser-10' (H3S10ph) in LPS-stimulated myeloid cells. This phosphorylation enhances the accessibility of the cryptic NF-kappa-B-binding sites marking promoters for increased NF-kappa-B recruitment. Phosphorylates CDC25B and CDC25C which is required for binding to 14-3-3 proteins and leads to initiation of a G2 delay after ultraviolet radiation (PubMed:11333986). Phosphorylates TIAR following DNA damage, releasing TIAR from GADD45A mRNA and preventing mRNA degradation (PubMed:20932473). The p38 MAPKs may also have kinase-independent roles, which are thought to be due to the binding to targets in the absence of phosphorylation. Protein O-Glc-N-acylation catalyzed by the OGT is regulated by MAPK14, and, although OGT does not seem to be phosphorylated by MAPK14, their interaction increases upon MAPK14 activation induced by glucose deprivation. This interaction may regulate OGT activity by recruiting it to specific targets such as neurofilament H, stimulating its O-Glc-N-acylation. Required in mid-fetal development for the growth of embryo-derived blood vessels in the labyrinth layer of the placenta. Also plays an essential role in developmental and stress-induced erythropoiesis, through regulation of EPO gene expression (PubMed:10943842). Isoform MXI2 activation is stimulated by mitogens and oxidative stress and only poorly phosphorylates ELK1 and ATF2. Isoform EXIP may play a role in the early onset of apoptosis. Phosphorylates S100A9 at 'Thr-113' (PubMed:15905572). Phosphorylates NLRP1 downstream of MAP3K20/ZAK in response to UV-B irradiation and ribosome collisions, promoting activation of the NLRP1 inflammasome and pyroptosis (PubMed:35857590)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny  \nMitogen‐activated protein kinase 14 (MAPK14), commonly known as p38 alpha, belongs to the p38 subfamily of stress‐activated protein kinases (SAPKs) and exists alongside three other isoforms—p38 beta, p38 gamma, and p38 delta—which have been conserved throughout vertebrate evolution (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 4-5, martinblanco2000p38mapksignalling pages 1-2). MAPK14 is evolutionarily related to the yeast stress‐responsive HOG1 kinase, and it shares approximately 50% sequence identity with ERK2, reflecting its placement within the conserved CMGC group of serine/threonine kinases (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 4-5, widmann1999mitogenactivatedproteinkinase pages 5-6). Phylogenetic analyses based on conserved dual phosphorylation motifs and docking regions place MAPK14 in a distinct evolutionary branch that has maintained critical functional residues over hundreds of millions of years, indicating its essential role in cellular stress responses across species (kultz1998phylogeneticandfunctional pages 2-3).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nMAPK14 catalyzes the phosphorylation reaction in which the gamma phosphate from ATP is transferred to serine or threonine residues on target proteins, yielding ADP and a phosphorylated substrate along with the release of a proton (widmann1999mitogenactivatedproteinkinase pages 1-2). This reaction is summarized as: ATP + [protein] – (L‑serine or L‑threonine) → ADP + [protein] – (L‑serine/threonine) – phosphate + H⁺, a reaction central to the regulation of numerous downstream signaling events (orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 33-38).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of MAPK14 strictly requires divalent metal ions, with Mg²⁺ serving as an essential cofactor that facilitates the coordination of ATP within the kinase’s catalytic site, thereby enabling efficient phosphate transfer (theodosiou2002mapkinasephosphatases pages 1-2).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nMAPK14 exhibits strict substrate specificity for serine/threonine residues that are typically followed by a proline residue, phosphorylating substrates that contain an S/T-P motif (martinblanco2000p38mapksignalling pages 2-3, orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 38-41). In addition to this core motif, substrate recognition is further refined by distinct docking interactions between MAPK14 and its targets, enabling the kinase to phosphorylate an estimated 200–300 different substrates, including transcription factors such as ATF1, ATF2, MEF2, Elk-1, and TP53, as well as downstream kinases like MK2, MK3, MNK1, and MNK2 (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 4-5, martinblanco2000p38mapksignalling pages 1-2).\n\n5. Structure  \nMAPK14 is organized around a central catalytic domain that conforms to the standard bilobed structure of the CMGC family, consisting of a predominantly β-stranded N-terminal lobe and an α-helical C-terminal lobe (orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 41-45, cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 4-5). The activation loop, which contains the conserved threonine-glycine-tyrosine (TGY) motif, undergoes dual phosphorylation by upstream MAP kinase kinases (MKK3 and MKK6), a modification that is essential for the conformational rearrangement leading to full kinase activation (martinblanco2000p38mapksignalling pages 1-2, widmann1999mitogenactivatedproteinkinase pages 5-6). Crystal structure analyses have revealed the presence of a well-defined ATP-binding cleft, a hydrophobic spine, and key residues such as those in the C-helix that are critical for substrate binding and catalysis; these features are further modulated by subtle variations in the docking sites that help distinguish p38 alpha from its paralogs (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 4-5, orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 41-45).\n\n6. Regulation  \nMAPK14 is regulated primarily through dual phosphorylation on threonine-183 and tyrosine-185 within its activation loop, a process mediated by the upstream dual-specificity MAP kinase kinases MKK3 and MKK6, which respond to a variety of stress stimuli such as UV irradiation, oxidative stress, and inflammatory cytokines (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 4-5, martinblanco2000p38mapksignalling pages 1-2). In addition to phosphorylation, MAPK14’s activity is modulated by its subcellular localization, with the kinase shuttling between the cytoplasm and the nucleus upon activation, thereby regulating both transcriptional and cytoplasmic substrates (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 23-24, roux2004erkandp38 pages 17-18). Negative regulation of MAPK14 is provided by MAP kinase phosphatases (MKPs), which dephosphorylate the activation loop and attenuate the kinase signal, while interactions with other proteins, such as casein kinase II, further influence its autophosphorylation and subsequent activity (theodosiou2002mapkinasephosphatases pages 1-2, roux2004erkandp38 pages 17-18).\n\n7. Function  \nMAPK14 serves as an essential component in the MAPK signal transduction cascade, mediating cellular responses to extracellular stimuli that include pro-inflammatory cytokines and environmental stressors (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 4-5, martinblanco2000p38mapksignalling pages 1-2). Through phosphorylation of an extensive array of substrates—ranging from transcription factors like ATF1, ATF2, MEF2, and TP53 to downstream kinases such as MK2/MK3 and MNK1/MNK2—MAPK14 orchestrates processes including inflammation, cell cycle regulation, protein turnover, and receptor endocytosis (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 24-25, widmann1999mitogenactivatedproteinkinase pages 24-25). In the nucleus, activated MAPK14 phosphorylates chromatin-associated proteins and transcription factors, contributing to immediate-early gene induction and chromatin remodeling during stress responses (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 19-20, orand2023revealingthemechanism pages 25-29). Moreover, MAPK14 plays a critical role in modulating protein degradation pathways in the cytoplasm—regulating substrates such as the ubiquitin ligase SIAH2 and the transmembrane metalloprotease ADAM17—which in turn influence receptor internalization and ectodomain shedding, processes that are central to receptor-mediated signaling and cell proliferation (cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 23-24, widmann1999mitogenactivatedproteinkinase pages 22-24).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral pharmacological inhibitors have been developed to target MAPK14 by competing with ATP binding, with compounds such as SB203580 and SB202190 being widely used in experimental settings to block its kinase activity (martinblanco2000p38mapksignalling pages 1-2, new1998prakanovel pages 1-3). MAPK14 is associated with a variety of pathological conditions, including inflammatory diseases, certain cancers, and developmental anomalies related to its regulatory roles in cytokine expression, apoptosis, and cellular stress responses (widmann1999mitogenactivatedproteinkinase pages 24-25, theodosiou2002mapkinasephosphatases pages 1-2). Its multiple substrates and extensive involvement in signal transduction indicate that aberrant MAPK14 activity can have widespread cellular consequences, which is why it continues to be a significant target for the development of anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer therapies (roux2004erkandp38 pages 16-17, cargnello2011activationandfunction pages 24-25).\n\n9.

In response to reduction of intracellular ATP levels, AMPK activates energy-producing pathways and inhibits energy-consuming processes: inhibits protein, carbohydrate and lipid biosynthesis, as well as cell growth and proliferation (PubMed:17307971, PubMed:17712357). AMPK acts via direct phosphorylation of metabolic enzymes, and by longer-term effects via phosphorylation of transcription regulators (PubMed:17307971, PubMed:17712357). Regulates lipid synthesis by phosphorylating and inactivating lipid metabolic enzymes such as ACACA, ACACB, GYS1, HMGCR and LIPE; regulates fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis by phosphorylating acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACACA and ACACB) and hormone-sensitive lipase (LIPE) enzymes, respectively (PubMed:7959015). Promotes lipolysis of lipid droplets by mediating phosphorylation of isoform 1 of CHKA (CHKalpha2) (PubMed:34077757). Regulates insulin-signaling and glycolysis by phosphorylating IRS1, PFKFB2 and PFKFB3 (By similarity). Involved in insulin receptor/INSR internalization (PubMed:25687571). AMPK stimulates glucose uptake in muscle by increasing the translocation of the glucose transporter SLC2A4/GLUT4 to the plasma membrane, possibly by mediating phosphorylation of TBC1D4/AS160 (By similarity). Regulates transcription and chromatin structure by phosphorylating transcription regulators involved in energy metabolism such as CRTC2/TORC2, FOXO3, histone H2B, HDAC5, MEF2C, MLXIPL/ChREBP, EP300, HNF4A, p53/TP53, SREBF1, SREBF2 and PPARGC1A (PubMed:11518699, PubMed:11554766, PubMed:15866171, PubMed:17711846, PubMed:18184930). Acts as a key regulator of glucose homeostasis in liver by phosphorylating CRTC2/TORC2, leading to CRTC2/TORC2 sequestration in the cytoplasm (By similarity). In response to stress, phosphorylates 'Ser-36' of histone H2B (H2BS36ph), leading to promote transcription (By similarity). Acts as a key regulator of cell growth and proliferation by phosphorylating FNIP1, TSC2, RPTOR, WDR24 and ATG1/ULK1: in response to nutrient limitation, negatively regulates the mTORC1 complex by phosphorylating RPTOR component of the mTORC1 complex and by phosphorylating and activating TSC2 (PubMed:14651849, PubMed:20160076, PubMed:21205641). Also phosphorylates and inhibits GATOR2 subunit WDR24 in response to nutrient limitation, leading to suppress glucose-mediated mTORC1 activation (PubMed:36732624). In response to energetic stress, phosphorylates FNIP1, inactivating the non-canonical mTORC1 signaling, thereby promoting nuclear translocation of TFEB and TFE3, and inducing transcription of lysosomal or autophagy genes (PubMed:37079666). In response to nutrient limitation, promotes autophagy by phosphorylating and activating ATG1/ULK1 (PubMed:21205641). In that process, it also activates WDR45/WIPI4 (PubMed:28561066). Phosphorylates CASP6, thereby preventing its autoprocessing and subsequent activation (PubMed:32029622). AMPK also acts as a regulator of circadian rhythm by mediating phosphorylation of CRY1, leading to destabilize it (By similarity). May regulate the Wnt signaling pathway by phosphorylating CTNNB1, leading to stabilize it (By similarity). Also acts as a regulator of cellular polarity by remodeling the actin cytoskeleton; probably by indirectly activating myosin (PubMed:17486097). Also phosphorylates CFTR, EEF2K, KLC1, NOS3 and SLC12A1 (PubMed:12519745, PubMed:20074060). Plays an important role in the differential regulation of pro-autophagy (composed of PIK3C3, BECN1, PIK3R4 and UVRAG or ATG14) and non-autophagy (composed of PIK3C3, BECN1 and PIK3R4) complexes, in response to glucose starvation (By similarity). Can inhibit the non-autophagy complex by phosphorylating PIK3C3 and can activate the pro-autophagy complex by phosphorylating BECN1 (By similarity). Upon glucose starvation, promotes ARF6 activation in a kinase-independent manner leading to cell migration (PubMed:36017701). Upon glucose deprivation mediates the phosphorylation of ACSS2 at 'Ser-659', which exposes the nuclear localization signal of ACSS2, required for its interaction with KPNA1 and nuclear translocation (PubMed:28552616). Upon stress, regulates mitochondrial fragmentation through phosphorylation of MTFR1L (PubMed:36367943)**\n\n---\n\n# Objective (Task)\n\nDevelop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). \n\nDISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available.

Phylogeny:**  \n5′-AMP-activated protein kinase catalytic subunit alpha‑2 (PRKAA2, also known as AMPKα2, AMPK2, Acetyl‑CoA carboxylase kinase, or Hydroxymethylglutaryl‑CoA reductase kinase) belongs to the highly conserved AMP‑activated protein kinase family, which in turn is part of the larger family of serine/threonine kinases within the CAMK group of the human kinome (henriksson2012lkb1signalingpathways pages 30-33). Orthologs of PRKAA2 are present throughout eukaryotes, ranging from yeast and plants to vertebrates, indicating that the core energy‐sensing machinery originated in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) (jain2018studyingampkin pages 25-28, yan2018structureandphysiological pages 14-15). In mammals, two catalytic subunit isoforms—AMPKα1 and AMPKα2—form mutually exclusive heterotrimeric complexes with regulatory β and γ subunits, and these isoforms display partly overlapping but distinct tissue expression patterns and functional roles (russo2013ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 1-6, henriksson2012lkb1signalingpathwaysa pages 30-33). Phylogenetically, the AMPK family clusters together with other energy‑sensing kinases such as SNF1 in yeast and SnRK1 in plants, underscoring its central evolutionary role in metabolic regulation (minchenko2012snf1ampactivatedproteinkinases pages 1-3).\n\n**2. Reaction Catalyzed:**  \nAMPKα2 catalyzes the phosphorylation of serine or threonine residues in substrate proteins using ATP as the phosphate donor. The canonical reaction can be summarized as follows:  \nATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺ (hawley2023bay3827andsbi0206965 pages 19-20).\n\n**3. Cofactor Requirements:**  \nThe catalytic activity of AMPKα2 requires the presence of divalent metal ions, most notably Mg²⁺, which coordinates with ATP in the kinase active site during the phosphotransfer reaction (hawley2023bay3827andsbi0206965 pages 19-20).\n\n**4. Substrate Specificity:**  \nAMPKα2 shows a substrate specificity that preferentially targets serine/threonine residues within defined consensus motifs characterized by a basic residue enrichment upstream of the target site and hydrophobic residues at specific positions relative to the phosphoacceptor. In many substrates, a basic amino acid at the –3 or –4 position relative to the serine/threonine residue is common, which is consistent with the substrate specificity defined for AMPK in broader serine/threonine kinome studies (rana2015smallmoleculeadenosine pages 12-15, yan2018structureandphysiological pages 14-15). Substrates phosphorylated by AMPKα2 include key enzymes in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, transcription regulators, and proteins involved in cell growth and autophagy; examples include acetyl‑CoA carboxylases (ACACA and ACACB), hormone‑sensitive lipase (LIPE), and regulators such as CRTC2, FOXO3, and components of mTORC1 signaling (russo2013ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 38-41).\n\n**5. Structure:**  \nThe 3D structure of AMPKα2 is defined by a modular architecture with several distinct domains. The protein contains an N‑terminal catalytic kinase domain that exhibits the typical bilobal fold of serine/threonine kinases, including an N‑lobe responsible for ATP binding and a larger C‑lobe that accommodates substrate binding (li2015structuralbasisof pages 16-17, kurumbail2016structureandregulation pages 1-4). Within the kinase domain, key structural features include the activation loop, which contains the critical regulatory threonine (Thr172 in AMPKα2) whose phosphorylation is essential for full kinase activation, a hydrophobic α‑C helix that contributes to ATP binding, and a hydrophobic spine that stabilizes the active conformation (steinberg2023newinsightsinto pages 9-13, yan2018structureandphysiological pages 10-12). Beyond the kinase domain, AMPKα2 contains additional C‑terminal regions that mediate interaction with regulatory β and γ subunits; these interactions are necessary for the formation of the intact heterotrimeric complex (henriksson2012lkb1signalingpathwaysa pages 36-40, kurumbail2016structureandregulation pages 4-6). Notably, the regulatory gamma subunit contains multiple cystathionine‑β‑synthase (CBS) domains that bind AMP, ADP, or ATP, thereby allosterically modulating the conformation of the catalytic alpha subunit (yan2018structureandphysiological pages 1-4). Structural studies, including crystallographic and AlphaFold models, reveal that upon nucleotide binding, conformational shifts occur that increase the exposure and stability of the activation loop, thus promoting full activation (kurumbail2016structureandregulation pages 6-9).\n\n**6. Regulation:**  \nAMPKα2 is subject to a complex regulatory network involving both covalent and allosteric mechanisms. The most critical regulatory modification is the phosphorylation of the activation loop at Thr172 by upstream kinases such as LKB1, CaMKKβ, and TAK1, which results in a dramatic (up to 500–1000‑fold) increase in kinase activity (lu2021ampkα2activationby pages 26-33, steinberg2023newinsightsinto pages 13-17). In addition, AMPKα2 is allosterically regulated by the binding of adenine nucleotides to the gamma subunit; increased levels of AMP or ADP promote a conformational change that not only allosterically enhances activity by approximately 2‑ to 5‑fold but also protects the phosphorylated Thr172 from dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases (ovens2021posttranslationalmodificationsof pages 2-5, yan2018structureandphysiological pages 14-15). Inhibitory phosphorylation events on other sites of AMPKα2, such as Ser485/491, mediated by kinases including Akt and PKA, can counteract the activation by Thr172 phosphorylation, providing a fine‑tuned control over its activity (lu2021ampkα2activationby pages 33-36, ovens2021posttranslationalmodificationsof pages 20-21). Additional post‑translational modifications, including ubiquitination, have been reported to influence the stability and turnover of the protein, further modulating its cellular levels and the duration of its signaling (ovens2021posttranslationalmodificationsof pages 21-22, rana2015smallmoleculeadenosine pages 60-64). Small molecule activators such as A‑769662 and MK‑8722 have been shown to bind distinct allosteric sites, including the ADaM site, thereby promoting AMPK activation independently of upstream kinases (rana2015smallmoleculeadenosine pages 5-8).\n\n**7. Function:**  \nAMPKα2 serves as the catalytic engine of the AMPK heterotrimer, functioning as a master cellular energy sensor that orchestrates metabolic homeostasis. Upon a decrease in intracellular ATP levels and the concomitant rise in AMP or ADP, AMPKα2 becomes activated and shifts cellular metabolism from energy-consuming anabolic processes to energy-generating catabolic processes (hawley2023bay3827andsbi0206965 pages 19-20, russo2013ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 38-41). In terms of metabolism, activated AMPKα2 phosphorylates and inactivates acetyl‑CoA carboxylases (ACACA and ACACB), thereby inhibiting fatty acid synthesis and promoting fatty acid oxidation; it also phosphorylates hormone‑sensitive lipase (LIPE) to regulate cholesterol synthesis and lipolysis (hawley2023bay3827andsbi0206965 pages 19-20, russo2013ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 34-36). Moreover, AMPKα2 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of glucose metabolism by modulating insulin signaling through phosphorylation of IRS1 and promoting the translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 via substrates such as TBC1D4/AS160, thereby enhancing glucose uptake particularly in skeletal muscle (russo2013ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 38-41, yan2018structureandphysiological pages 1-4). At the transcriptional level, AMPKα2 influences gene expression by phosphorylating transcriptional regulators including CRTC2, FOXO3, and p53, which in turn coordinate the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, energy expenditure, and cellular stress responses (hawley2023bay3827andsbi0206965 pages 19-20, ovens2021posttranslationalmodificationsof pages 5-6). In response to nutrient and energy stress, AMPKα2 negatively regulates mTORC1 signaling by phosphorylating key components such as RPTOR and TSC2, thereby inhibiting anabolic processes such as protein, carbohydrate, and lipid biosynthesis and reducing cell growth and proliferation (russo2013ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 38-41, steinberg2023newinsightsinto pages 6-9). AMPKα2 is also involved in the regulation of autophagy through direct phosphorylation of ULK1 and associated autophagic proteins, facilitating the recycling of cellular components under stress conditions (lu2021ampkα2activationby pages 36-37, ovens2021posttranslationalmodificationsof pages 6-7). In addition, AMPKα2 has roles in modulating mitochondrial dynamics, circadian rhythm control via CRY1 phosphorylation, and actin cytoskeleton remodeling, which collectively contribute to its central role in maintaining cellular energy balance (steinberg2023newinsightsinto pages 9-13, sukumaran2020insightontranscriptional pages 2-3).\n\n**8. Other Comments:**  \nBeyond its well‑established roles in metabolic regulation, AMPKα2 has been implicated in various disease contexts including type 2 diabetes, obesity, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases. The dysregulation of AMPKα2 activity—either through impaired activation via mutations in upstream kinases like LKB1 or through aberrant inhibitory modifications—can disrupt normal energy homeostasis and contribute to pathological states (russo2013ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 38-41, yan2018structureandphysiological pages 1-4). Several pharmacological activators of AMPK are under development or in clinical use; metformin, for instance, is thought to exert part of its anti‑diabetic effects through upregulation of AMPK activity, although its precise mechanism remains complex (russell2020ampactivatedproteinkinase pages 2-4, rana2015smallmoleculeadenosine pages 68-72). There is also ongoing research into the development of allosteric activators and other small molecules that directly target AMPKα2 to enhance its activity for therapeutic benefit, particularly in cancers characterized by metabolic reprogramming and in metabolic syndrome (rana2015smallmoleculeadenosine pages 68-72, steinberg2023newinsightsinto pages 13-17). Additionally, AMPKα2 is subject to degradation by ubiquitin‑mediated pathways that may serve as potential targets for intervention (ovens2021posttranslationalmodificationsof pages 21-22). Its central role in integrating energy stress signals with metabolic and growth control pathways makes AMPKα2 a major focus of research in the development of strategies for metabolic disorders and as a potential tumor suppressor in oncology (sukumaran2020insightontranscriptional pages 2-3).\n\n**9.

Plays an important role in cellular stress response. Contributes to regulation of renal Na(+) retention, renal K(+) elimination, salt appetite, gastric acid secretion, intestinal Na(+)/H(+) exchange and nutrient transport, insulin-dependent salt sensitivity of blood pressure, salt sensitivity of peripheral glucose uptake, cardiac repolarization and memory consolidation. Up-regulates Na(+) channels: SCNN1A/ENAC, SCN5A and ASIC1/ACCN2, K(+) channels: KCNJ1/ROMK1, KCNA1-5, KCNQ1-5 and KCNE1, epithelial Ca(2+) channels: TRPV5 and TRPV6, chloride channels: BSND, CLCN2 and CFTR, glutamate transporters: SLC1A3/EAAT1, SLC1A2 /EAAT2, SLC1A1/EAAT3, SLC1A6/EAAT4 and SLC1A7/EAAT5, amino acid transporters: SLC1A5/ASCT2, SLC38A1/SN1 and SLC6A19, creatine transporter: SLC6A8, Na(+)/dicarboxylate cotransporter: SLC13A2/NADC1, Na(+)-dependent phosphate cotransporter: SLC34A2/NAPI-2B, glutamate receptor: GRIK2/GLUR6.

Regulates enzymes: GSK3A/B, PMM2 and Na(+)/K(+) ATPase, and transcription factors: CTNNB1 and nuclear factor NF-kappa-B. Stimulates sodium transport into epithelial cells by enhancing the stability and expression of SCNN1A/ENAC. This is achieved by phosphorylating the NEDD4L ubiquitin E3 ligase, promoting its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, thereby preventing it from binding to SCNN1A/ENAC and targeting it for degradation. Regulates store-operated Ca(+2) entry (SOCE) by stimulating ORAI1 and STIM1. Regulates KCNJ1/ROMK1 directly via its phosphorylation or indirectly via increased interaction with SLC9A3R2/NHERF2. Phosphorylates MDM2 and activates MDM2-dependent ubiquitination of p53/TP53. Phosphorylates MAPT/TAU and mediates microtubule depolymerization and neurite formation in hippocampal neurons. Phosphorylates SLC2A4/GLUT4 and up-regulates its activity. Phosphorylates APBB1/FE65 and promotes its localization to the nucleus. Phosphorylates MAPK1/ERK2 and activates it by enhancing its interaction with MAP2K1/MEK1 and MAP2K2/MEK2. Phosphorylates FBXW7 and plays an inhibitory role in the NOTCH1 signaling. Phosphorylates FOXO1 resulting in its relocalization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Phosphorylates FOXO3, promoting its exit from the nucleus and interference with FOXO3-dependent transcription. Phosphorylates BRAF and MAP3K3/MEKK3 and inhibits their activity. Phosphorylates SLC9A3/NHE3 in response to dexamethasone, resulting in its activation and increased localization at the cell membrane. Phosphorylates CREB1. Necessary for vascular remodeling during angiogenesis. Sustained high levels and activity may contribute to conditions such as hypertension and diabetic nephropathy.

Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). \n\n \n**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  \n\n**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  \n\n**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ \n\n**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ \n\n**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. \n\n**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). \n \n**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  \n\n**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). \n\n(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). \n\n(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). \n\n(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). \n\n \n**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1.

Phylogeny  \nSerine/threonine-protein kinase SGK1 belongs to the AGC kinase family and is evolutionarily conserved across eukaryotes. Orthologs have been identified from yeast to mammals, and its presence in a wide range of species indicates that it is part of the core set of kinases that emerged early during eukaryotic evolution (jeyarajUnknownyeardierolleder pages 27-30, daniels2010investigationofthe pages 31-35). Within the human kinome, SGK1, along with SGK2 and SGK3, forms a subfamily that displays significant sequence identity in the catalytic domain, with about 80% amino acid identity between SGK1 and its paralogues. Phylogenetic analyses place SGK1 alongside other AGC kinases such as Akt/PKB, PKA, and p70S6K, underscoring its conservation and the shared mechanisms of regulation through upstream kinases like PDK1 and mTOR complexes (daniels2010investigationofthe pages 31-35, firestone2003stimulusdependentregulationof pages 5-6).\n\n2. Reaction Catalyzed  \nSGK1 catalyzes the phosphorylation of serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins using ATP as a phosphate donor. The overall reaction can be summarized as:  \n  ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) → ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H⁺  \nThis reaction is typical of serine/threonine kinases in the AGC family (jeyarajUnknownyeardierolleder pages 27-30).\n\n3. Cofactor Requirements  \nThe enzymatic activity of SGK1 depends on the presence of divalent cations, with Mg²⁺ being the primary cofactor required to coordinate ATP within the kinase active site. This cofactor requirement is consistent with its classification among serine/threonine protein kinases (daniels2010investigationofthe pages 35-39).\n\n4. Substrate Specificity  \nSGK1 exhibits a substrate specificity that recognizes a consensus sequence motif that is typically described as R-X-R-X-X-(S/T)-φ, where “φ” denotes a hydrophobic amino acid. This motif is shared with other kinases in the AGC family and underlies SGK1’s ability to phosphorylate substrates involved in regulating ion channels, transporters, and transcription factors. Such specificity contributes to its role in modulating protein stability and activity, notably through the phosphorylation of regulators like the ubiquitin ligase NEDD4L, thereby affecting membrane retention of channels such as ENaC (daniels2010investigationofthe pages 35-39, jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 13-14).\n\n5. Structure  \nThe 3D structure of SGK1 consists of a relatively conserved catalytic domain of approximately 330 amino acids flanked by regulatory sequences. The N-terminal region is variable and is involved in subcellular localization, while the catalytic domain encompasses key structural features such as the ATP-binding site (including a conserved lysine residue analogous to lysine 127 in other kinases), the activation loop, and a hydrophobic motif that is phosphorylated by mTORC2 (serine 422 in SGK1) to induce an open, active conformation (daniels2010investigationofthe pages 35-39, jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 1-3). Additional regulatory features include a nuclear localization signal (NLS) present in the N-terminal portion that mediates stimulus-dependent nuclear–cytoplasmic shuttling as well as a six–amino-acid ubiquitin-binding motif that facilitates proteasomal degradation (firestone2003stimulusdependentregulationof pages 5-6, maestro2020serumandglucocorticoidinduced pages 3-4). The overall three-dimensional organization is consistent with a bilobal kinase fold, with an N-terminal β-sheet domain and a C-terminal α-helical domain, features typical for AGC kinases (daniels2010investigationofthe pages 31-35, jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 17-17).\n\n6. Regulation  \nSGK1 is regulated both transcriptionally and post-translationally. Transcriptional regulation occurs under the influence of serum, glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, cytokines, and various stressors such as hyperosmotic shock, high extracellular glucose, and oxidative stress. Its promoter contains response elements for glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors, enabling rapid induction in response to hormonal stimuli (firestone2003stimulusdependentregulationof pages 11-11, daniels2010investigationofthe pages 194-196).\n\nPost-translationally, SGK1 activation is achieved through phosphorylation at multiple key residues. Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) phosphorylates the activation loop (threonine 256), while mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif (serine 422) which is required for the proper alignment of the active site, thus enabling subsequent phosphorylation events (daniels2010investigationofthe pages 35-39, jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 1-3). Additional phosphorylation sites have been identified (e.g., serine 78, threonine 369) that further modulate its activity through inputs from other pathways such as PKA and MAPK (firestone2003stimulusdependentregulationof pages 9-10, jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 14-15). Moreover, SGK1 activity is intricately regulated by protein-protein interactions; binding to scaffold proteins such as NHERF2 helps localize SGK1 to the plasma membrane where it encounters its substrates. SGK1 also undergoes rapid ubiquitination via E3 ligases like Nedd4-2, which targets it for proteasomal degradation, thereby conferring a short half-life and dynamic control over its cellular levels (lou2016serumandglucocorticoid pages 14-15, maestro2020serumandglucocorticoidinduced pages 7-8).\n\n7. Function  \nSGK1 plays a significant role in a diverse array of physiological processes. It is expressed in multiple tissues including kidney, brain, lung, and muscle, and orchestrates a number of functions such as the regulation of ion channels, membrane transporters, and transcription factors. In epithelial cells, SGK1 enhances sodium reabsorption by up-regulating the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). This is achieved indirectly via phosphorylation of NEDD4L, whereby the binding of 14-3-3 proteins prevents the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of ENaC, resulting in increased channel stability and plasma membrane abundance (daniels2010investigationofthe pages 196-199, firestone2003stimulusdependentregulationof pages 11-11).\n\nIn addition to sodium transport, SGK1 phosphorylates and modulates the activity of an extensive list of ion channels and transporters. It up-regulates voltage-gated sodium channels (e.g., SCN5A), potassium channels such as ROMK1 (KCNJ1) and members of the KCNA and KCNQ families, epithelial calcium channels (TRPV5 and TRPV6), various chloride channels (e.g., CFTR), as well as several glutamate and amino acid transporters. SGK1 also directly phosphorylates regulators of the Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase and participates in the modulation of glucose transporters (GLUT1 and SGLT1) and other nutrient carriers, thereby influencing cellular metabolic processes (daniels2010investigationofthe pages 196-199, daniels2010investigationofthe pages 199-202, lou2016serumandglucocorticoid pages 3-5).\n\nBeyond its classical roles in ion transport, SGK1 is involved in cell survival, proliferation, and apoptosis. It acts on transcription factors such as FOXO1 and FOXO3, causing their relocalization out of the nucleus and thereby diminishing their pro-apoptotic transcriptional programs. In neuronal cells, SGK1 phosphorylates MAPT/TAU, contributing to neurite formation and microtubule dynamics, and it regulates memory consolidation by modulating CREB1 activity (firestone2003stimulusdependentregulationof pages 11-12, lang2009thephysiologicalimpact pages 12-13). Furthermore, SGK1 phosphorylates MDM2, which in turn leads to the ubiquitination and degradation of the tumor suppressor p53, linking SGK1 activity to cell cycle regulation and oncogenic processes (daniels2010investigationofthe pages 199-202, lang2009targetingsgk1in pages 1-2).\n\n8. Other Comments  \nSeveral small-molecule inhibitors targeting SGK1 have been developed in preclinical studies. Compounds such as GSK650394, EMD638683, and various pyrazolopyrazine derivatives have been identified as SGK1 inhibitors with potential applications in hypertensive, diabetic, and cancerous conditions (jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 14-15, lang2009targetingsgk1in pages 7-8, guerriero2020serumandglucocorticoidinducible pages 25-25). SGK1 has been implicated in the pathophysiology of hypertension, diabetic nephropathy, and salt-sensitive glucose uptake, and its dysregulation is associated with fibrotic processes within the kidney and heart. Overexpression or increased activity of SGK1 due to gain-of-function polymorphisms correlates with elevated blood pressure and enhanced sodium retention. In addition, its role in mediating anti-apoptotic and pro-survival signals renders SGK1 a potential contributor to cancer progression, and it has been examined as a target in non-small cell lung cancer (guerriero2020serumandglucocorticoidinducible pages 15-17, lang2009targetingsgk1in pages 6-7). Notably, alternative isoforms of SGK1 exhibit distinct cellular localizations and functional impacts—for example, isoform 2 has been reported to have a greater effect on plasma membrane expression of ENaC than isoform 1 (daniels2010investigationofthe pages 194-196). These diverse functional roles underscore the therapeutic interest in SGK1 inhibition, with approaches aimed at achieving selective blockade without interfering with closely related kinases such as Akt/PKB (jang2022serumandglucocorticoidregulated pages 14-15).\n\n9.
