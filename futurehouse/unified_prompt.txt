**Accepted name:** Ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K), which usually refers to either S6K1 or S6k2. Genes: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RPS6KB1, isoforms S6KaI (p85) and S6KaII (p70)) and RPS6KB2 (isoforms S6KbI (p56) and S6KbII (p54)). 

 
**Synonyms:** p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, S6K1 (p70-S6Ka), S6K2 (p70S6Kβ), S6 kinase alpha,  

**Phylogeny:** S6K belongs to the AGC kinase families, and it can be traced back to the common ancestor of eukaryotes. S6K1 is present in all mammalian species. The kinase is a part of an evolutionary core set of TOR pathway genes whose origin is in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) or before. This core includes S6K and four other AGC kinases, PDK1, PKB (AKT), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and SGK. S6K and RSK arose from a gene duplication in the ancestor of animals and fungi. Both S6K and RSK are regulated by PDK1, and S6K is activated by the TORC1 complex. In addition to the AGC kinases, this core includes the TORC1 complex (TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR), AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TORC2 (TOR, LST8, RICTOR and SIN1), RHEB and TSC2 (PMID 22057117, PMID 20587805).  

**Reaction catalyzed:** ATP + [protein]-(L-serine or L-threonine) = ADP + [protein]-(L-serine/threonine)-phosphate + H+ 

**Cofactor requirements:** Mg2+ 

**Substrate Specificity:** S6K has a substrate preference consisting of an RxRxxp[ST] motif. 

**Structure:** S6K has a central kinase domain, with flanking intrinsically disordered regulatory regions. S6K1 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, while S6K2 has a C-terminal Pro-rich region followed by an NLS sequence (PMID 32054043). S6K contains a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif near its N-terminus that is crucial for its mTOR-mediated activation, a FDIDL sequence at residues 5-9 in human S6K (PMID 11967149). The TOS-motif interacts with a basic site on the surface of the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 to facilitate phosphorylation and activation of S6K by mTORC1 (PMID 29236692). 
 
**Regulation:** Full activation of S6K is associated with two phosphorylation events. mTORC1 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6Ks (S6K1 at T389 and S6K2 at T388) (PMID 10567431). PDK1 phosphorylates the S6Ks activation loop (T-loop; S6K1 T229 and S6K2 T228) (PMID 9427642).  

**Function:** S6K controls cell size by facilitating mRNA transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis (PMID 35879299). S6K also controls apoptosis, metabolism, and feedback inhibition of the activating mTORC1. Inactivation of S6 kinases results in phenotypes that resemble aspects of caloric restriction (PMID 36036012). S6K substrates that are well characterized include: (1) Proteins involved in the RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, such as ribosomal protein S6, which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). 

(2) Proteins involved in feedback control of mTOR signalling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (PMID 38248343), mTOR (at residue Ser 2448 inhuman mTOR) and the SIN1 (stress‐activated map kinase‐interacting protein 1) subunit of mTORC2 (PMID 24161930). 

(3) Proteins involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), glycogen synthase kinase‐3‐α/β (GSK3α/GSK3β), AMP‐activated protein kinase catalytic subunit‐α (AMPKα). 

(4) Proteins with oncogenic or tumour suppressor activities, such as Bcl2‐associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glioma‐associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) and murine double‐minute 2 protein (Mdm2). 

 
**Inhibitors:** Inhibiting S6K can reduce the risk of obesity, enhance insulin sensitivity, and extend the life span of mammals. This has led to interest in developing specific S6K inhibitors. PF-4708671 is a commercially available inhibitor that is about 20-fold more potent at inhibiting S6K1, relative to closely related RSK1, RSK2 and MSK1 (PMID 20704563). Although it inhibits S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, PF-4708671 does not affect either mTORC1- or PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1. TAS0612 can inhibit S6K, RSK and PKB and has shown growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, irrespective of KRAS and BRAF mutations (PMID 37906695). S6K inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 have entered clinical trials (PMID 31942845). 

DISCLAIMER: The inhibitors cited above are reportedly effective against this protein kinase; however, their specificity is never absolute, and even more selective and potent agents may become available. Resources that compare the efficacy of these and other compounds against a spectrum of protein kinases should be consulted,  including the Chemical Probes portal (https://www.chemicalprobes.org) supported by the Wellcome Trust, the MRC Kinase Inhibitor Database (www.kinase-screen.mrc.ac.uk/kinase-inhibitors), a resource curated by the NIH (https://pharos.nih.gov/), the protein kinase ontology database (http://prokino.uga.edu/), and the KLIFS (Kinase–Ligand Interaction Fingerprints and Structures) database (https://klifs.net).
