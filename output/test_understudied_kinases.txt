"query": "Which protein kinases are less studied?"

Many protein kinases remain understudied or “dark” within the human kinome. 
A significant body of research demonstrates that while a few kinase families—such as tyrosine kinases (TK) and CMGC family kinases—are extensively studied, many others receive minimal attention. 
For example, only about 8% of the kinome has been targeted for cancer therapeutic exploration, and databases such as the NIH Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) have identified 162 “dark” kinases that are largely uncharacterized (anderson2023howmanykinases pages 2-3).

Within well‐defined kinase families, specific groups such as CK1 and RGC kinases, along with many lipid kinases (excluding outliers like PIK3CA), have far fewer literature citations compared to their counterparts, indicating low research focus (anderson2023howmanykinases pages 3-6). 
Additionally, pseudokinases—which, despite their structural similarity to canonical kinases, often lack definite enzymatic activity—receive markedly lower scientific attention (anderson2023howmanykinases pages 3-6).

Several studies pinpoint individual kinase examples that are less studied. For instance, in the context of central cellular functions and disease, serine/threonine kinases such as TAOK1 and the pseudokinase ULK4 have been highlighted for their potential roles—particularly in neurodevelopment or cell cycle regulation—despite their limited characterization (huang2021illuminatingunderstudiedkinases pages 25-31). 
TP53RK, as well as the kinases TSSK3 and TSSK6, are also identified as actors in specific cellular processes like cell cycle checkpoints and acrosomal vesicle localization, yet they remain largely unexplored (huang2021illuminatingunderstudiedkinases pages 25-31).

Expanding these observations to the kinome at large, Moret et al. have defined approximately one-third of the human kinase domains—around 182 domains—as understudied. These domains are unevenly distributed across kinase subfamilies, with a notably small fraction of tyrosine kinases falling into the understudied category (moret2020aresourcefor pages 10-13, moret2020aresourcefor pages 13-17). 
Even among understudied kinases, some, such as CLK3 and WNK3, have high-resolution structures available and commercial assays exist, yet their functional roles remain inadequately explored (moret2020aresourcefor pages 26-29). 
Further, analysis in cancer cell lines shows that numerous understudied kinases—such as NRBP1, PAN3, PI4KA, and PIP4K2C—are expressed at levels sometimes comparable to well-studied kinases, underscoring a gap between their biological presence and functional characterization (moret2020aresourcefor pages 17-20).

In the specialized context of prostate cancer, several kinase families not yet probed in clinical trials are emerging as understudied. Among these, the NIMA-related kinases NEK1 and NEK2 have been linked to castration-resistant prostate cancer progression, while additional kinases including BMPR1A, CASK, DSTYK, HASPIN, KALRN, MINK1, NEK3, NEK5, OBSCN, SLK, SPEG, STRADA, TTN, and Wnk3 have been noted for their potential roles in the disease but require further investigation (singh2023deregulatedkinaseaction pages 17-19).

Furthermore, within the serine/threonine kinase subfamily, the nuclear Dbf2-related kinases NDR1 (STK38) and NDR2 (STK38L) are less explored compared to their well-characterized counterparts LATS1 and LATS2, particularly regarding noncanonical signaling functions (santos2024theimportanceof pages 11-12).

Additionally, from a chemical probe development standpoint, kinases such as AAK1 and BMP2K (also referred to as BIKE) have been identified as understudied due to a lack of high-quality, selective inhibitors and correspondence with approximately 25% of the kinome, which remains poorly understood (serafim2021chemicalprobesfor pages 1-6). 
Voßen et al. further classify about 120 kinases as chemically unexplored, emphasizing that these targets lack validated chemical tools for probing their biological functions (vossen2024assessingdarknessof pages 10-14).

In summary, many protein kinases are less studied, encompassing entire subsets of the kinome (the “dark kinome”)—including various understudied lipid kinases, pseudokinases, serine/threonine kinases like TAOK1 and ULK4, several NEK family members, and others highlighted in cancer research and medicinal chemistry.
