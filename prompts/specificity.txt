Create a summary of the substrate specificity of {protein_name} (Synonyms: {name_and_synonyms}). 

Try to include the following in the summary:
- Describe what substrates the protein acts on.
- What sequence motifs or amino acids determine its specificity.
- How substrate specificity affects its function in different contexts.
- Any known preference for particular residues or chemical groups.

Here are some examples of the response you can use as a template. Note that the examples could be related to a different protein.
