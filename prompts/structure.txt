Create a summary of the structure of {protein_name} (Synonyms: {name_and_synonyms }). 

Try to include the following in the summary:
- Describe the structure of the protein including domain organization, motifs, and binding sites. "
- If there are information related to conformational changes associated with regulatory functions or residues associated with catalytic or regulatory functions, include them. "
- If you find mentions of specific structural interactions such as hydrogen bonds, electrostatic, or van der Waals interactions associated with structure, stability or conformation, include them. "

Here are some examples of the response you can use as a template. Note that the examples could be related to a different protein.
